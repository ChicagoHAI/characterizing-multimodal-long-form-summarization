This increase reflects growth of 20% in our core business and the addition of Datalink to our results of operations beginning January 6, 2017. As a result, for the first time in the Company's history, net sales from the provision of services approximated 10%. Our gross profit increased faster than sales, increasing by 24%, or $175.5 million, compared to 2016, also up 24% year over year excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated gross margin improved approximately 20 basis points to 13.7% of net sales in 2017. This increase reflects solid growth in net sales and gross profit in our core business combined with the addition of Datalink. Selling and administrative expenses increased $138.1 million, or 24%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The year over year change reflects the addition of Datalink and an increase of 5% in selling and administrative expenses in our core business. We reported earnings from operations of $179.3 million in 2017, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year, which represented 2.7% of net sales, consistent with the prior year. Our effective tax rate in 2017 was 43.0%, driven by the effects of U.S. federal tax reform enacted in December 2017. This higher tax rate in 2017 compares to our effective tax rate of 39.3% in 2016 and 36.4% in 2015. Net earnings and diluted net earnings per share were $90.7 million and $2.50, respectively, in 2017. In 2016, we reported net earnings of $84.7 million and diluted net earnings per share of $2.32. In 2015, we reported net earnings of $75.9 million and diluted net earnings per share of $1.98.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThe results of operations for 2017 include the following items:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the results of the acquisitions of Caase.com and Datalink, from their respective acquisition dates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the loss on the sale of our Russia business totaling $3.6 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>transaction costs totaling $3.3 million, $2.5 million net of tax, associated with the acquisitions of Caase.com and Datalink; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>severance and restructuring expenses of $9.0 million, $7.3 million net of tax; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>incremental income tax expense related to U.S. federal tax reform of $13.4 million. </td> </tr>\n</table> The results of operations for 2016 include the following items:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the results of the acquisition of Ignia effective September 1, 2016; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>transaction costs totaling $4.4 million, $4.2 million net of tax, associated with the acquisitions of Ignia and Datalink; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>severance and restructuring expenses of $4.6 million, $3.3 million net of tax; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>a gain of $338,000 on the sale of our Bloomingdale, Illinois real estate; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the repurchase of approximately 1.9 million shares of the Company's common stock for $50 million. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe results of operations for 2015 include the following items:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the results of the acquisition of BlueMetal effective October 1, 2015; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>severance and restructuring expenses of $4.9 million, $4.3 million net of tax; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>an impairment loss of $800,000 to further reduce the carrying amount of our previously owned real estate in Bloomingdale, Illinois to its estimated fair value less costs to sell; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the repurchase of approximately 3.3 million shares of the Company's common stock for $91.8 million. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThroughout the \u201cOverview\u201d and \u201cResults of Operations\u201d sections of \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d we refer to changes in net sales, gross profit, selling and administrative expenses and earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and in North America, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In computing these amounts and percentages, we compare the current period amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior period amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted average translation rate for the current period.\nNet of tax amounts referenced above were computed using the statutory tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expenses were recorded, adjusted for the effects of valuation allowances on net operating losses in certain jurisdictions.\nDuring 2017, we used $305.4 million in operating activities, including approximately $186.9 million, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, utilized to fund the acquisitions of Datalink and Caase.com. We ended the year with $105.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $307.9 million of debt outstanding under our long-term debt facilities.\nDetails about segment results of operations can be found in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements, including the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nGeneral\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ from our estimates. Members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nWe consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nSales Recognition\nSales are recognized when title and risk of loss are passed to the client, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our standard sales terms are F.O.B. shipping point or equivalent, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client. However, because we either (i) have a general practice of covering client losses while products are in transit despite title and risk of loss contractually transferring at the point of shipment or (ii) have specifically stated F.O.B. destination contractual terms with the client, delivery is not deemed to have occurred until the point in time when the product is received by the client. We make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates.\nWe leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our partners and suppliers to deliver products to our clients without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. We recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis when the product is received by the client. We recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we control the transaction as the primary obligor for product fulfillment in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the client, we set the price of the product charged to the client, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our clients to determine their hardware and software specifications.\nRevenue is recognized from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license, but in no case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met (i.e., evidence of the arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable).\nWe sell certain third-party service contracts and software maintenance and cloud or software-as-a-service subscription products for which we are not the primary obligor. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and, thus, are recorded on a net sales recognition basis. As we enter into contracts with third-party service providers or vendors and our clients, we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales. We determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an agent or broker. Under gross sales recognition, the selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction, and there are no costs of goods sold.\nWe recognize revenue for sales of services ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided if there is no discernible pattern of recognition of the cost to perform the service. Billings for such services that are made in advance of the related revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe recognize revenue for professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis based upon hours incurred as the services are performed and amounts are earned. Net sales for these service engagements are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\nAdditionally, we sell certain professional services contracts on a fixed fee basis. Revenues for fixed fee professional services contracts are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. Net sales for these service contracts are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\nIn certain arrangements, we may provide a combination of hardware and software products as well as services. Services that are performed by us in conjunction with hardware and software sales that are completed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product are recognized upon delivery, when title passes to the client, for the hardware sale. Net sales of services that are performed at client locations are primarily service-only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed. The total consideration for an arrangement with multiple deliverables is allocated to all deliverables that represent a separate unit of accounting using the relative selling price method.\nPartner Funding\nWe receive payments and credits from partners, including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs, volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs. Partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold. Partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the related inventory is sold. Partner funding received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as it is earned as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs. Consideration that exceeds the specific, incremental, identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold. Changes in estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs could have a material effect on our results of operations and our cash flows.\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Purchased Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nWe review property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment, our asset impairment review assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or the asset group plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset or the asset group (if any) and compares that value to the carrying value. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount. This approach uses our estimates of future market growth, forecasted net sales and costs, expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates.\nWe perform an annual review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, and that assessment requires a significant amount of judgment. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations. Any adverse change in these factors, among others, could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a \u201ccomponent\u201d). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management of the segment regularly reviews the operating results of that component. When two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, the components may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. Insight has three reporting units, which are equivalent to our operating segments.\nWe may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the goodwill impairment test is not required. In completing a quantitative test for a potential impairment of goodwill, we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value, including goodwill. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit, including the market and income approaches. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment, or both. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the Company, future market growth, forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. To ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units, we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units.\nSee further information on the carrying value of goodwill in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2017, U.S. federal tax reform was enacted as part of the Tax Act. The change in tax law required a remeasurement of our deferred tax balances. In addition, the change in tax law included provisions requiring mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. Due to the enactment date and complexities of the new law, we have not completed our accounting related to these items. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, issued on December 22, 2017, we have concluded that the U.S. income taxes attributable to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred income taxes, the mandatory deemed repatriation provision and the state tax effects of these items are provisional amounts.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider past operating results, future market growth, forecasted earnings, historical and projected taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance. If we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized, then all or part of the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe establish liabilities for potentially unfavorable outcomes associated with uncertain tax positions taken on specific tax matters. These liabilities are based on management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. There may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in subsequent recognition or derecognition of a tax position based on all the available information at the time. If material adjustments are warranted, it could affect our effective tax rate.\nAdditional information about recent U.S. federal tax reform, the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions can be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We are also subject to various government agency, client and partner audits. We continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual. An accrual is made if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows. Additional information about contingencies can be found in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of goods sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance and restructuring expenses, loss on sale of foreign entity and acquisition-related expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-operating expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net earnings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> During the year ended December 31, 2017, our consolidated net sales from the provision of services was approximately 10% of net sales. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we began reporting, on the face of our consolidated statement of operations, net sales from the provision of services and the related costs of goods sold separately from net sales of products and the related costs of goods. For comparability purposes, the presentation of net sales and costs of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. These changes in presentation had no effect on previously reported total net sales, total costs of goods sold or gross profit amounts.\nIn conjunction with this change in presentation, because fees earned from activities reported net are considered services revenues, we reclassified certain revenue streams for which we act as the agent in the transaction to net sales from services. Previously, we included these net revenue streams within our software and, to a lesser extent, hardware sales mix categories based on the type of product being sold (e.g., fees earned for the sale of software maintenance and certain software licenses were included in software sales and fees earned for the sale of certain third-party provided training were included in hardware sales when we historically disclosed and analyzed our sales mix). For comparability purposes, the sales mix among our hardware, software and services categories for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net sales amounts.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOur gross profit across the business and related to product versus services sales are, and will continue to be, impacted by partner incentives, which can change significantly in the amounts made available and the related product or services sales being incentivized by the partner. These changes could impact our results of operations to the extent we are unable to remediate and respond to them.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales increased 22%, or $1.2 billion, in 2017 compared to 2016. Net sales of products (hardware and software) increased 21% and net sales of services increased 36% in 2017 compared to 2016 (as reclassified). Our net sales by operating segment for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,181,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,971,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,355,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,338,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APAC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,703,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,485,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net sales in North America increased 30%, or $1.2 billion, in 2017 compared to 2016, including 17% year over year growth in our core business driven by higher volume of sales from new and existing clients, and the addition of Datalink, which reported $524.3 million in net sales in 2017. Net sales of hardware, software and services increased 37%, 14% and 40%, respectively, year over year. The improvement in net sales in the hardware category reflects higher volume of sales to large enterprise clients and was due primarily to strong growth in data center solutions as well as client devices. Strong growth in our core business was complemented by the addition of Datalink, which accounted for approximately 29% of the year over year growth in the hardware category. The increase in the software category was also affected by the acquisition of Datalink, which accounted for approximately 70% of the year over year increase. The increase in services net sales reflects the addition of Datalink to our business, offset partially by declines in technical services projects in our core business in 2017 compared to 2016. Services net sales during 2017 also reflected the continued trend toward higher sales of cloud-based offerings and a higher mix of software maintenance sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction.

Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. Net sales of hardware and services were up 11% and 15%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of software declined 7% year to year. The increase in hardware net sales was due primarily to higher volume sales of client devices, storage and networking solutions to public sector clients. The increase in services net sales was due primarily to increased sales of license consulting services and partner delivered services to new and existing clients across the region. In addition, a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction, are included in the services category. The decrease in software net sales was driven by a single significant transaction during the prior year period affecting the year over year comparison.

Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales decreased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016. Increases in hardware and services net sales year over year were offset by a decrease in software net sales during 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from the timing of a single client agreement in the public sector that historically transacted in the fourth quarter but instead transacted in the first quarter of 2018 this year. The growth in hardware net sales was primarily due to our continued expansion of hardware offerings in this market. The growth in services net sales resulted from the contributions of Ignia, as well as a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and cloud subscriptions products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis in 2017 compared to 2016.

The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a net increase in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, of 30 basis points year over year. The net increase in product margin was due primarily to improvements in hardware and software product margin during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the acquisition of Datalink, which includes sales of data center products at higher gross margins then in our core business. The positive effect of the Datalink acquisition was partially offset by lower product margin in our core business due to a higher mix of business with large enterprise clients, where margins tend to be lower than other client groups. Services margin improvement year over year of 11 basis points was driven by an increase in margin generated by sales of warranty services during 2017 compared to 2016, which was driven by the acquisition of Datalink. These increases in margin were offset partially by a decrease in margin from lower fees from enterprise software agreements of 23 basis points during 2017 compared to 2016. The year over year comparison was also affected by a $2.2 million insurance settlement recognized during 2016 as a reduction of cost of sales due to the nature of the related insured loss previously recorded.\nEMEA's gross profit in 2017 increased 2% compared to 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit was up 4% in 2017 compared to 2016. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 10 basis points year over year. The year over year improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to a 60 basis point increase in services margin due to a higher volume of higher margin services net sales during 2017 compared to 2016 as well as the positive effect on services margin that resulted from the higher volume of sales that were recorded on a net sales recognition basis in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement in gross margin resulting from higher margin services net sales was partially offset by a net decrease in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, of 50 basis points during 2017 compared to 2016. The decline in product margin primarily resulted from lower margins on large enterprise and public sector deals transacted during 2017.\nAPAC's gross profit increased 15% in 2017 compared to 2016, with gross margin increasing to 22.0% in 2017 from 18.2% in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit increased 13% in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement in gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to the positive effect on services margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, an increase in the mix of higher margin services net sales and the margin contribution from increases in hardware net sales during 2017 compared to 2016.\nOperating Expenses.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $138.1 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 10 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2017 compared to 2016.\nSelling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net\nSales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net\nSales </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>530,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>401,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APAC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>723,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>585,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> North America's selling and administrative expenses increased 32%, or $129.5 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased approximately 10 basis points year over year as a percentage of net sales to 10.2% of net sales in 2017. The increase in expenses reflects the addition of Datalink to our North America business effective January 2017 and an increase in selling and administrative expenses in our core business of approximately 5% compared to 2016. The addition of Datalink was the primary driver for the $62.4 million increase in salaries and wages, contract labor and teammate benefit expenses for 2017 compared to 2016, as well as year over year increases in travel and entertainment, facilities and marketing expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense also increased approximately $6.0 million year over year, as amortization expense of $11.5 million, associated with the intangible assets acquired from Datalink, was offset partially by the year over year effect of intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions being fully amortized in the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, increased sales and gross profit in 2017 compared to 2016, resulted in a $37.0 million increase in variable compensation year over year.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses increased 3%, or $4.0 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased approximately 10 basis points to 12.1% of net sales in 2017. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 4% compared to 2016. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by a $3.1 million increase in salaries and wages and teammate benefits expenses due to increased headcount. This year over year increase in selling and administrative expenses was offset partially by a decrease in amortization expense during 2017 compared to 2016, as intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions were fully amortized in the third quarter of 2016.\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses increased 19%, or $4.6 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased approximately 350 basis points to 17.0% of net sales in 2017. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 16% compared to 2016. The year over year increase was primarily driven by increased selling and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of Ignia, effective September 1, 2016, which accounted for over half of the year over year increase in selling and administrative expenses. Additionally, salaries and wages expenses increased as we invested to support growth in cloud and services sales.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2017, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $4.0 million, $4.9 million and $104,000, respectively. The North America charges related to severance actions taken to realign roles and responsibilities subsequent to the acquisition of Datalink in January 2017, as well as a headcount reduction as part of cost reduction initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2017. The EMEA charges primarily related to headcount reductions in France, Germany and the Netherlands as part our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives in EMEA. The APAC charges primarily related to severance actions taken subsequent to the acquisition of Ignia. Current period charges were offset by adjustments for changes in estimates of previous accruals as cash payments were made during 2017. During 2016, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $3.0 million, $1.5 million and $118,000, respectively. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\nAcquisition-related Expenses. During 2017, we incurred $3.2 million in direct third-party transaction costs related to the acquisition of Datalink in North America and $106,000 in such costs related to the acquisition of Caase.com in EMEA. Comparatively, during 2016, we incurred $4.3 million in such costs related to the acquisition of Datalink in North America and $169,000 in such costs related to the acquisition of Ignia in APAC. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of acquisitions.\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2017 and 2016 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The slight increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on such balances and to higher average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances during 2017.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 122%, or $10.5 million, in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to borrowings under our Term Loan A (\u201cTLA\u201d) as well as higher borrowing rates and higher average daily balances under our other financing facilities, in 2017 compared to 2016, while imputed interest under our inventory financing facility increased $3.3 million from 2016 to 2017 to $6.7 million. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities and was relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was 43.0% compared to 39.3% in 2016. The increase in the tax rate from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to the effect of U.S. federal tax reform that was enacted in December 2017, which accounted for 8.4% of our effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2017 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the effect of U.S. federal tax reform enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017, as previously noted, as well as state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefits, and increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2017 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nAs previously noted, the sales mix among our hardware, software and services categories for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 have been reclassified to conform to changes made to the current year presentation, as reflected in the following results of operations discussion for these periods. These changes in classification had no effect on previously reported total net sales, total costs of goods sold or gross profit amounts.\nNet Sales. Net sales increased 2%, or $112.4 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of products (hardware and software) increased 1% and net sales of services increased 14% in 2016 (as reclassified) compared to 2015 (as reclassified). Our net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,971,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,823,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,338,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,371,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APAC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,485,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,373,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net sales in North America increased 4%, or $148.3 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of hardware and services (as reclassified) increased 5% and 12%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of software (as reclassified) decreased 1% year to year. The improvement in net sales in the hardware category was due primarily to higher sales of client devices, servers and storage products. The increase in services net sales reflects the BlueMetal acquisition in October 2015 as well as organic growth in technical services projects. Services net sales during 2016 also reflected the continued trend toward higher sales of cloud-based offerings and a higher mix of software maintenance sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction.

Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of software (as reclassified) were up 1% year over year, while net sales of hardware and services (as reclassified) were down 9% and 1%, respectively, year to year. The increase in software net sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by increased volume with large enterprise clients. The decrease in services net sales was due primarily to the relative impact year over year of the volume of sales of software maintenance and cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, offset partially by increased sales of license consulting services and partner delivered third-party services to new and existing clients across the region.

The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increases in supplier discounts year over year as we took advantage of early pay discounts offered by certain of our partners, which generated a 6 basis point improvement in margin year over year. During 2016, we also recognized a $2.2 million insurance settlement as a reduction of cost of sales due to the nature of the related insured loss previously recorded. The insurance settlement accounted for 6 basis points of the year over year margin expansion during 2016 compared to 2015. Although an increase in higher margin consulting services sales generated a 15 basis point improvement in gross margin year over year, the increase was partially offset by a decline in margin generated by sales of warranty services of 12 basis points year to year.\nEMEA's gross profit remained flat in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit was up 7% in 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 30 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the positive effect on gross margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis within the net sales line item. Changes in the mix and size of transactions and an increase in partner funding earlier in 2016 also contributed to the margin improvement during 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, we recognized an increase in margin resulting from higher fees from enterprise software agreements during 2016 compared to 2015.\nAPAC's gross profit increased 12% in 2016 compared to 2015, with gross margin increasing to 18.2% in 2016 from 16.0% in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit increased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015. The improvement in gross margin in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to the positive effect on margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, an increase in the mix of higher margin services net sales, higher partner funding and an increase in hardware sales during 2016 compared to 2015.\nOperating Expenses.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $337,000 in 2016 compared to 2015.

Teammate benefits expense, including healthcare expenses, increased $6.0 million year over year due to an increase in healthcare claims, and variable compensation increased $4.6 million as a result of the increase in net sales and gross profit year over year. These increases in expenses during 2016 compared to 2015 were partially offset by a decline in the provision for losses on accounts receivable of $3.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to favorable collection results and a decrease in salaries and wages and contract labor of $2.7 million resulting from cost reduction initiatives implemented earlier in 2016 across our North America business. Our results for 2015 included a non-cash charge of $800,000 to reduce the carrying amount of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses decreased 3%, or $5.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased approximately 10 basis points to 12.0% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% compared to the prior year. The increase in expenses (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was primarily driven by increased salaries and wages and teammate benefits expenses attributed to higher average cost per head in conjunction with our investments in sales and services related headcount to support services and cloud growth across the region.\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses increased 6%, or $1.2 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased approximately 90 basis points to 13.5% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 7% compared to the prior year. The year over year increase is primarily driven by higher variable compensation as a result of the increase in gross profit year over year and increased selling and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of Ignia, a business technology consulting and managed services provider, effective September 1, 2016.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2016, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $3.0 million, $1.5 million and $118,000, respectively. The North America charges related to a headcount reduction as part of cost reduction initiatives early in 2016 noted previously, while the EMEA charges related to significant restructuring activities, primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany and France, as we worked to reduce our selling and administrative expenses in EMEA. Current period charges were offset by adjustments for changes in estimates of previous accruals as cash payments were made during 2016. During 2015, North America and EMEA recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $1.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively. APAC did not record any severance expense in 2015. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\nAcquisition-related Expenses. During 2016, we incurred $169,000 in direct third-party transaction costs related to the acquisition of Ignia and $4.3 million in such costs related to the acquisition of Datalink that was completed on January 6, 2017. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of acquisitions.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2016 and 2015 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on such balances and to higher average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances during 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 19% in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher borrowing rates and higher average daily balances under our debt facilities in 2016 compared to 2015, while imputed interest under our inventory financing facility remained flat from 2015 to 2016 at $3.4 million. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2016 was 39.3% compared to 36.4% in 2015. The increase in the tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to the effect of a change in tax law that was enacted in December 2016 related to the taxation of foreign currency translation gains or losses arising from qualified business units and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016. The effective tax rate in 2016 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions and state taxes in the United States as well as the tax law change during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016, as noted previously. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2016 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated cash flow information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(305,426 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>181,102 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(204,645 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,185 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57,637 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>397,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58,230 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(83,328 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency exchange effect on cash and cash equivalent balances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,809 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,683 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(97,051 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,454 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,524 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,978 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Cash and Cash Flow\nOur primary uses of cash during 2017 were to fund working capital requirements, pay down our debt balances, fund capital expenditures and acquire Caase.com and Datalink. Operating activities used $305.4 million in cash in 2017. Both the 2017 and 2016 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end, whereby a single significant receivable was collected from a client in the fourth quarter of the year for which the related payment to the supplier was due and paid in January of the following year, as discussed in more detail below. During 2017, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt facilities of $269.3 million and acquired Caase.com and Datalink for $6.0 million and $180.9 million, respectively, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. Capital expenditures were $19.2 million in 2017, a 57% increase from 2016, reflecting higher IT investments in our core ERP systems and e-commerce and digital marketing platforms year over year. Cash and cash equivalent balances in 2017 were positively affected by $15.9 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rates.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with the funds available under our financing facilities, will be adequate to support our cash and working capital requirements for operations as well as other strategic investments over the next 12 months. We expect existing cash and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating cash activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as capital expenditures, repurchases of our common stock and debt repayments, for at least the next 12 months.\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities reflect our net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and write-offs and write-downs of assets, as well as changes in asset and liability balances. Net earnings for 2017 was also adjusted for the loss on sale of our Russia business, which included a non-cash charge for the release of our cumulative translation adjustment balance upon sale of the foreign entity. As noted previously, our net sales grew 22% in 2017 and in particular, our North America net sales grew 30%. This level of growth required significant working capital investments as we experienced higher demand for inventory positions with key clients and, at the same time, our accounts receivable balances began to age as collection efforts did not keep up with the growth. The 2017 results also reflect the collection of a single significant receivable from a client in the fourth quarter of 2016 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $160 million was due and paid in January 2017, as noted previously. Further impacting our operating cash flows was the fact that we report cash flows associated with trade payables financed under our inventory financing facility in the financing section of our statement of cash flows. In 2017, and most notably in the fourth quarter, we expanded the use of that facility with certain vendors. Had we not leveraged the facility during 2017, the net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $141.0 million that are reflected as cash flows provided by financing activities would have been included within trade payables, which are reflected in the operating activities section of our statement of cash flows. The increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2017 to support specific client engagements. The decrease in deferred revenue was a result of revenue recognition in 2017 on a number of larger client transactions in North America for which monies had been collected from clients prior to December 31, 2016, in advance of meeting the criteria for revenue recognition.\nIn 2016, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflected increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015. However, the 2016 results were also affected by a single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2016 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $160 million was due and paid in January 2017, as noted previously. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a similar experience with a significant receivable collected in the quarter for which the payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was not made until the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the effects of these two individually significant timing differences, cash flow from operations would have been nominal for 2016. Additionally, the increase in accounts payable reflected as cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was affected by the increased use of our inventory financing facility in 2016 to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers. Increases in accounts payable under this facility were reflected as cash provided by financing activities, as discussed below. Had these purchases been made without using the inventory financing facility during 2016, the net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million that were reflected as cash flows from financing activities would have been reflected as an increase in accounts payable, which would have been an increase in cash provided by operating activities. We used more working capital in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, as our sales growth was weighted to the last two months of the current year. The $50.1 million increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2016, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. The $28.9 million increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2016, to support specific client engagements and hardware sale transactions in transit to clients as of December 31, 2016 such that delivery was not deemed to have occurred until the product was received by the client in early January 2017.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIn 2015, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflected increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. However, the 2015 results were also affected by the single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2015 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was due and paid in January 2016, as noted previously. The increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2015, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. As a result, cash flows from operating activities in 2015 exceeded our historical average annual cash flow generation of $80 million to $120 million.\nOur consolidated cash flow operating metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Days sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable (\u201cDSOs\u201d) (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Days inventory outstanding (\u201cDIOs\u201d) (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Days purchases outstanding in ending accounts payable (\u201cDPOs\u201d) (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(72 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(88 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash conversion cycle (days) (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td>Calculated as the balance of accounts receivable, net at the end of the period divided by daily net sales.

Our 2016 cash conversion cycle was below our target range of 20 to 25 days as a result of unusually high DPOs associated with the $160 million payment timing difference in North America at the end of the prior year period, as discussed below. Our 2017 cash conversion cycle was above our target range due to the increases in our inventory and accounts receivable balances noted above. We expect working capital trends to return to normalized levels and have action plans in place to improve our cash flow efficiency in 2018.\nOur cash conversion cycle was 14 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of six days from the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to an 11 day increase in DPOs driven by a single significant payment to a supplier in North America that was due and paid in January 2017. Although the payment to the supplier was not due until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2016 under normal credit terms. Both the 2016 and 2015 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end; however, the magnitude of the 2016 transaction had a greater effect on DPOs. The computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 includes a payable to a supplier of $160 million, and the computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 30, 2015 includes a payable to a supplier of $60 million, both of which do not have corresponding accounts receivable outstanding as of the end of the respective periods.\nOur cash conversion cycle was 20 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of four days from the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to an increase in DPOs in North America driven by a single significant payment to a supplier that was due and paid in January 2016, after the resolution of certain invoicing issues with the supplier. Although we did not pay the supplier until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2015 under normal credit terms.\nWe expect that cash flow from operations will be used, at least partially, to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms we grant to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts. We intend to use cash generated in 2018 in excess of working capital needs to support our capital expenditures for the year, to repurchase shares of our common stock and to pay down our debt balances. We also may use cash to fund potential acquisitions.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNet cash used in investing activities. Capital expenditures of $19.2 million, $12.3 million and $13.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were primarily related to technology and facility enhancements. We expect total capital expenditures in 2018 to be between $15.0 million and $20.0 million, primarily for technology-related upgrade projects and the integration of prior acquisitions.\nDuring 2017 we acquired Caase.com and Datalink for $6.0 million and $180.9 million, respectively, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. During 2016, we acquired Ignia for $10.8 million, net of cash acquired, and during 2015, we acquired BlueMetal for $44.2 million, net of cash acquired.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities. During 2017, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt under our revolving facility, TLA and accounts receivable securitization facility (\u201cABS facility\u201d) of $269.3 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $141.0 million. During 2016, we made net combined repayments on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $49.5 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million. In 2016, we also funded $50.0 million of repurchases of our common stock. During 2015, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $28.0 million and made net repayments under our inventory financing facility of $16.5 million. In 2015, we also funded $91.8 million of repurchases of our common stock.\nFinancing Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2017, our long-term debt balance includes $25.0 million outstanding under our $250.0 million ABS facility and $117.5 million outstanding under our $350.0 million revolving facility. In connection with the acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017, we amended our revolving facility to expand the facility by $175.0 million in the form of a TLA that requires amortization payments in years one through five. As of December 31, 2017, we had $166.3 million outstanding under our TLA. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a description of our amendment to our revolving facility in connection with our acquisition of Datalink.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the current portion of our long-term debt relates to our capital leases and other financing obligations as well as the amortization payments due in 2018 under our TLA. Our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives.\nWhile the ABS facility has a stated maximum amount, the actual availability under the ABS facility is limited by the quantity and quality of the underlying accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2017, qualified receivables were sufficient to permit access to the full $250.0 million under the ABS facility.\nOur consolidated debt balance that can be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter under our revolving facility, our TLA and our ABS facility is limited by certain financial covenants, particularly a maximum leverage ratio. The maximum leverage ratio is calculated as aggregate debt outstanding divided by the sum of the Company's trailing twelve month net earnings (loss) plus (i) interest expense, excluding non-cash imputed interest on our inventory financing facility, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation, (v) extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash losses or expenses and (vi) certain cash restructuring and acquisition-related charges and synergies, not to exceed a specified cap (\u201cadjusted earnings\u201d). The maximum leverage ratio permitted under the facilities was increased to 3.50 times trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings in connection with the acquisition of Datalink in January 2017. We anticipate that we will be in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio requirements, which will decrease to 3.25 in 2018, over the next four quarters. However, a significant drop in the Company's adjusted earnings would limit the amount of indebtedness that could be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter to a level that would be below the Company's consolidated maximum facility amounts. Based on the maximum permitted leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017, the Company's debt balance that could have been outstanding under our revolving facility, TLA and ABS facility was the full amount of the maximum borrowing capacity of $766.3 million.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOur revolving facility, our TLA and our ABS facility contain various covenants customary for transactions of this type, including limitations on the payment of dividends and the requirement that we comply with maximum leverage and minimum fixed charge ratio requirements, comply with a minimum receivable requirement and meet monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. If we fail to comply with these covenants, the lenders would be able to demand payment within a specified time period. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Further, the terms of the ABS facility identify various circumstances that would result in an \u201camortization event\u201d under the facility. As of December 31, 2017, no such \u201camortization event\u201d had occurred.\nWe also have an agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable - inventory financing facility in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe aggregate availability for vendor purchases under our inventory financing facility is $325,000,000. From time to time and at our option, we may request to increase the aggregate amount available under the inventory financing facility by up to an aggregate of $25,000,000, subject to customary conditions. The facility matures on June 23, 2021. Additionally, the facility may be renewed under certain circumstances described in the agreement for successive 12-month periods. Interest does not accrue on accounts payable under this facility provided the accounts payable are paid within stated vendor terms (typically 60 days).\nNotes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report also include: a description of our financing facilities; amounts outstanding; amounts available and weighted average borrowings and interest rates during the year.\nUndistributed Foreign Earnings\nCash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States. As a result of the U.S. federal tax reform enacted in December 2017, all undistributed foreign earnings are deemed distributed. We provided for U.S. income and withholding taxes on the earnings deemed distributed from all of our foreign subsidiaries during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $87.1 million in cash and cash equivalents in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, the majority of our foreign cash resides in the Netherlands, Canada and Australia. Certain of these cash balances will be remitted to the United States by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business or though actual dividend distributions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, which include guaranties and indemnifications.

This requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales. We believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients, as prices charged by us are not set by long-term contracts; however, as a result of competitive pressure, there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe information contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report concerning a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including our expected dates of adoption and the estimated effects on our results of operations and financial condition, is incorporated by reference herein.\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,181,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,971,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,355,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,338,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APAC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,703,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,485,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n IV.

Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 4% compared to 2016. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by a $3.1 million increase in salaries and wages and teammate benefits expenses due to increased headcount. This year over year increase in selling and administrative expenses was offset partially by a decrease in amortization expense during 2017 compared to 2016, as intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions were fully amortized in the third quarter of 2016.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOperating Expenses.\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net\nSales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net\nSales </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>530,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>401,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APAC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>723,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>585,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 the loss on the sale of our Russia business totaling $3.6 million; \nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net\nSales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net\nSales </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>691,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>525,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APAC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>918,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>743,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses increased 19%, or $4.6 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased approximately 350 basis points to 17.0% of net sales in 2017.

Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit was up 4% in 2017 compared to 2016. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 10 basis points year over year. The year over year improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to a 60 basis point increase in services margin due to a higher volume of higher margin services net sales during 2017 compared to 2016 as well as the positive effect on services margin that resulted from the higher volume of sales that were recorded on a net sales recognition basis in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement in gross margin resulting from higher margin services net sales was partially offset by a net decrease in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, of 50 basis points during 2017 compared to 2016. The decline in product margin primarily resulted from lower margins on large enterprise and public sector deals transacted during 2017.\nThe following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nIn North America, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $270,000 and $87,984,000 that were previously

2017 compared to 2016, and increased approximately 10 basis points year over year as a percentage of net sales to 10.2% of net sales in 2017. The increase in expenses reflects the addition of Datalink to our North America business effective January 2017 and an increase in selling and administrative expenses in our core business of approximately 5% compared to 2016. The addition of Datalink was the primary driver for the $62.4 million increase in salaries and wages, contract labor and teammate benefit expenses for 2017 compared to 2016, as well as year over year increases in travel and entertainment, facilities and marketing expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense also increased approximately $6.0 million year over year, as amortization expense of $11.5 million, associated with the intangible assets acquired from Datalink, was offset partially by the year over year effect of intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions being fully amortized in the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, increased sales and gross profit in 2017 compared to 2016, resulted in a $37.0 million increase in variable compensation year over year.\nOverview\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(As Reclassified) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(As Reclassified) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,454,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,336,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,146,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,157,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>370,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>329,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,971,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,823,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nIn conjunction with this change in presentation, because fees earned from activities reported net are considered services revenues, we reclassified certain revenue streams for which we act as the agent in the transaction to net sales from services. Previously, we included these net revenue streams within our software and, to a lesser extent, hardware sales mix categories based on the type of product being sold (e.g., fees earned for the sale of software maintenance and certain software licenses were included in software sales and fees earned for the sale of certain third-party provided training were included in hardware sales when we historically disclosed and analyzed our sales mix). For comparability purposes, the sales mix among our hardware, software and services categories for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net sales amounts.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>APAC </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(As Reclassified) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,352,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,454,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,310,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,146,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>519,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>370,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,181,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,971,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (2) Excludes obligations under our inventory financing facility of $319.5 million, $154.9 million, $106.3 million, $122.8 million and $115.3 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Although we did not pay the supplier until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2015 under normal credit terms.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAlthough we set purchase targets with our partners tied to the amount of supplier reimbursements we receive, we have no material contractual purchase obligations with our partners.\nOur revolving facility, our TLA and our ABS facility contain various covenants customary for transactions of this type, including limitations on the payment of dividends and the requirement that we comply with maximum leverage and minimum fixed charge ratio requirements, comply with a minimum receivable requirement and meet monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. If we fail to comply with these covenants, the lenders would be able to demand payment within a specified time period. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Further, the terms of the ABS facility identify various circumstances that would result in an \u201camortization event\u201d under the facility. As of December 31, 2017, no such \u201camortization event\u201d had occurred.\nAdditional information about recent U.S. federal tax reform, the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions can be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated cash flow information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2016 was 39.3% compared to 36.4% in 2015. The increase in the tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to the effect of a change in tax law that was enacted in December 2016 related to the taxation of foreign currency translation gains or losses arising from qualified business units and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016. The effective tax rate in 2016 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions and state taxes in the United States as well as the tax law change during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016, as noted previously. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2016 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\nOn a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2017, our net sales of $6.7 billion increased 22% compared to 2016. This increase reflects growth of 20% in our core business and the addition of Datalink to our results of operations beginning January 6, 2017. As a result, for the first time in the Company's history, net sales from the provision of services approximated 10%. Our gross profit increased faster than sales, increasing by 24%, or $175.5 million, compared to 2016, also up 24% year over year excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated gross margin improved approximately 20 basis points to 13.7% of net sales in 2017. This increase reflects solid growth in net sales and gross profit in our core business combined with the addition of Datalink. Selling and administrative expenses increased $138.1 million, or 24%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The year over year change reflects the addition of Datalink and an increase of 5% in selling and administrative expenses in our core business. We reported earnings from operations of $179.3 million in 2017, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year, which represented 2.7% of net sales, consistent with the prior year. Our effective tax rate in 2017 was 43.0%, driven by the effects of U.S. federal tax reform enacted in December 2017.

Our 2016 cash conversion cycle was below our target range of 20 to 25 days as a result of unusually high DPOs associated with the $160 million payment timing difference in North America at the end of the prior year period, as discussed below. Our 2017 cash conversion cycle was above our target range due to the increases in our inventory and accounts receivable balances noted above.

Billings for such services that are made in advance of the related revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We are also subject to various government agency, client and partner audits. We continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual. An accrual is made if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows. Additional information about contingencies can be found in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNet Sales. Net sales increased 2%, or $112.4 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of products (hardware and software) increased 1% and net sales of services increased 14% in 2016 (as reclassified) compared to 2015 (as reclassified). Our net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDuring 2017 we acquired Caase.com and Datalink for $6.0 million and $180.9 million, respectively, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. During 2016, we acquired Ignia for $10.8 million, net of cash acquired, and during 2015, we acquired BlueMetal for $44.2 million, net of cash acquired.\nOur gross profit across the business and related to product versus services sales are, and will continue to be, impacted by partner incentives, which can change significantly in the amounts made available and the related product or services sales being incentivized by the partner. These changes could impact our results of operations to the extent we are unable to remediate and respond to them.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nThe results of operations for 2017 include the following items:\nThe aggregate availability for vendor purchases under our inventory financing facility is $325,000,000. From time to time and at our option, we may request to increase the aggregate amount available under the inventory financing facility by up to an aggregate of $25,000,000, subject to customary conditions. The facility matures on June 23, 2021. Additionally, the facility may be renewed under certain circumstances described in the agreement for successive 12-month periods. Interest does not accrue on accounts payable under this facility provided the accounts payable are paid within stated vendor terms (typically 60 days).\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAPAC's gross profit increased 15% in 2017 compared to 2016, with gross margin increasing to 22.0% in 2017 from 18.2% in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit increased 13% in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement in gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to the positive effect on services margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, an increase in the mix of higher margin services net sales and the margin contribution from increases in hardware net sales during 2017 compared to 2016.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n\nWe expect that cash flow from operations will be used, at least partially, to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms we grant to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts. We intend to use cash generated in 2018 in excess of working capital needs to support our capital expenditures for the year, to repurchase shares of our common stock and to pay down our debt balances. We also may use cash to fund potential acquisitions.\n \u2022 In EMEA: \nFull year 2017 financial and operational highlights included the following:\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n I. Estimated interest payments of $603,000 in 2018 and $301,000 in the first six months of 2019, based on the current debt balance at December 31, 2017 of $25.0 million under our ABS facility, multiplied by the floating interest rate applicable at December 31, 2017 of 2.41% per annum. \n \u2022 the results of the acquisition of Ignia effective September 1, 2016; \nInterest Income. Interest income for 2017 and 2016 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The slight increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on such balances and to higher average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances during 2017.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n \u2022 We completed the acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017 and completed the IT systems and back office integration activities by mid-year. We achieved expense synergies ahead of our expectations and are pleased with the overall financial results of the business in its first year as part of Insight; \nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $337,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. Selling and administrative expenses decreased approximately 20 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2016 compared to 2015.\nWe are a Fortune 500 global IT provider helping businesses of all sizes - from small and medium sized firms to worldwide enterprises, governments, schools and health care organizations - define, architect, implement and manage Intelligent Technology SolutionsTM in North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d); and Asia-Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d). We empower our clients to manage their IT environments so they can drive meaningful business outcomes today and transform their operations for tomorrow. Our offerings in North America and certain countries in EMEA and APAC include hardware, software and services. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments are largely software and certain software-related services.\nAPAC's gross profit increased 12% in 2016 compared to 2015, with gross margin increasing to 18.2% in 2016 from 16.0% in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit increased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015. The improvement in gross margin in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to the positive effect on margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, an increase in the mix of higher margin services net sales, higher partner funding and an increase in hardware sales during 2016 compared to 2015.\n In EMEA, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $48,586,000 and $43,388,000 that were previously reported as part of our software product category in 2016 and 2015, respectively, were reclassified to services to conform to the current year presentation.\n Net sales in North America increased 4%, or $148.3 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of hardware and services (as reclassified) increased 5% and 12%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of software (as reclassified) decreased 1% year to year. The improvement in net sales in the hardware category was due primarily to higher sales of client devices, servers and storage products. The increase in services net sales reflects the BlueMetal acquisition in October 2015 as well as organic growth in technical services projects. Services net sales during 2016 also reflected the continued trend toward higher sales of cloud-based offerings and a higher mix of software maintenance sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Our net sales by offering category for North America for 2016 (as reclassified) and 2015 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nWe have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, which include guaranties and indemnifications. These arrangements are discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We believe that none of our off-balance sheet arrangements have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities.\nIn 2016, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflected increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015. However, the 2016 results were also affected by a single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2016 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $160 million was due and paid in January 2017, as noted previously. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a similar experience with a significant receivable collected in the quarter for which the payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was not made until the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the effects of these two individually significant timing differences, cash flow from operations would have been nominal for 2016. Additionally, the increase in accounts payable reflected as cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was affected by the increased use of our inventory financing facility in 2016 to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers. Increases in accounts payable under this facility were reflected as cash provided by financing activities, as discussed below. Had these purchases been made without using the inventory financing facility during 2016, the net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million that were reflected as cash flows from financing activities would have been reflected as an increase in accounts payable, which would have been an increase in cash provided by operating activities. We used more working capital in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, as our sales growth was weighted to the last two months of the current year. The $50.1 million increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2016, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. The $28.9 million increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2016, to support specific client engagements and hardware sale transactions in transit to clients as of December 31, 2016 such that delivery was not deemed to have occurred until the product was received by the client in early January 2017.\n \u2022 the repurchase of approximately 3.3 million shares of the Company's common stock for $91.8 million. \nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\n \u2022 We continued to transform into a cloud and solutions business, invested in technical and pre-sales and service delivery teammates focused on cloud technologies and grew our services sales by 15%; \n \u2022 transaction costs totaling $4.4 million, $4.2 million net of tax, associated with the acquisitions of Ignia and Datalink; \nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n \u2022 the repurchase of approximately 1.9 million shares of the Company's common stock for $50 million. \nOur primary uses of cash during 2017 were to fund working capital requirements, pay down our debt balances, fund capital expenditures and acquire Caase.com and Datalink. Operating activities used $305.4 million in cash in 2017. Both the 2017 and 2016 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end, whereby a single significant receivable was collected from a client in the fourth quarter of the year for which the related payment to the supplier was due and paid in January of the following year, as discussed in more detail below. During 2017, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt facilities of $269.3 million and acquired Caase.com and Datalink for $6.0 million and $180.9 million, respectively, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. Capital expenditures were $19.2 million in 2017, a 57% increase from 2016, reflecting higher IT investments in our core ERP systems and e-commerce and digital marketing platforms year over year. Cash and cash equivalent balances in 2017 were positively affected by $15.9 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nNorth America's gross profit in 2017 increased 32% compared to 2016, and as a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 10 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a net increase in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, of 30 basis points year over year. The net increase in product margin was due primarily to improvements in hardware and software product margin during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the acquisition of Datalink, which includes sales of data center products at higher gross margins then in our core business. The positive effect of the Datalink acquisition was partially offset by lower product margin in our core business due to a higher mix of business with large enterprise clients, where margins tend to be lower than other client groups. Services margin improvement year over year of 11 basis points was driven by an increase in margin generated by sales of warranty services during 2017 compared to 2016, which was driven by the acquisition of Datalink. These increases in margin were offset partially by a decrease in margin from lower fees from enterprise software agreements of 23 basis points during 2017 compared to 2016. The year over year comparison was also affected by a $2.2 million insurance settlement recognized during 2016 as a reduction of cost of sales due to the nature of the related insured loss previously recorded.\nCash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States. As a result of the U.S. federal tax reform enacted in December 2017, all undistributed foreign earnings are deemed distributed. We provided for U.S. income and withholding taxes on the earnings deemed distributed from all of our foreign subsidiaries during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $87.1 million in cash and cash equivalents in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, the majority of our foreign cash resides in the Netherlands, Canada and Australia. Certain of these cash balances will be remitted to the United States by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business or though actual dividend distributions.\n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $9.0 million, $7.3 million net of tax; and \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNet sales by category for North America, EMEA and APAC were as follows for 2016 (as reclassified) and 2015 (as reclassified):\nNet sales in APAC decreased 2%, or $3.3 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales in 2016 remained flat compared to 2015. An increase in services and hardware net sales year over year was offset by a decrease in software net sales during 2016 compared to 2015. Our net sales by offering category for APAC for 2016 (as reclassified) and 2015 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Purchased Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n (c) Amounts in the table above exclude non-cancellable rental income of approximately $1.6 million due in less than one year and a total of approximately $1.6 million due in years one through three. \nNet sales in APAC decreased 5%, or $8.7 million, in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales decreased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016. Increases in hardware and services net sales year over year were offset by a decrease in software net sales during 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from the timing of a single client agreement in the public sector that historically transacted in the fourth quarter but instead transacted in the first quarter of 2018 this year. The growth in hardware net sales was primarily due to our continued expansion of hardware offerings in this market. The growth in services net sales resulted from the contributions of Ignia, as well as a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and cloud subscriptions products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis in 2017 compared to 2016. Our net sales by offering category for APAC for 2017 and 2016 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this report. Additionally, any references to our \u201ccore\u201d business exclude Datalink's results subsequent to the Datalink acquisition.\nAdditionally, we sell certain professional services contracts on a fixed fee basis. Revenues for fixed fee professional services contracts are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. Net sales for these service contracts are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\n (b) As of December 31, 2017, this amount has been included in our contractual obligations table above as being due in less than 1 year due to the 30- to 120-day stated vendor terms. See further discussion in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \n \u2022 the results of the acquisition of BlueMetal effective October 1, 2015; \nSales Recognition\nOur cash conversion cycle was 14 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of six days from the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to an 11 day increase in DPOs driven by a single significant payment to a supplier in North America that was due and paid in January 2017. Although the payment to the supplier was not due until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2016 under normal credit terms. Both the 2016 and 2015 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end; however, the magnitude of the 2016 transaction had a greater effect on DPOs. The computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 includes a payable to a supplier of $160 million, and the computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 30, 2015 includes a payable to a supplier of $60 million, both of which do not have corresponding accounts receivable outstanding as of the end of the respective periods.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nWhile the ABS facility has a stated maximum amount, the actual availability under the ABS facility is limited by the quantity and quality of the underlying accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2017, qualified receivables were sufficient to permit access to the full $250.0 million under the ABS facility.\nNet sales in EMEA decreased 2%, or $32.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of software (as reclassified) were up 1% year over year, while net sales of hardware and services (as reclassified) were down 9% and 1%, respectively, year to year. The increase in software net sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by increased volume with large enterprise clients. The decrease in services net sales was due primarily to the relative impact year over year of the volume of sales of software maintenance and cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, offset partially by increased sales of license consulting services and partner delivered third-party services to new and existing clients across the region. Our net sales by offering category for EMEA for 2016 (as reclassified) and 2015 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nWe sell certain third-party service contracts and software maintenance and cloud or software-as-a-service subscription products for which we are not the primary obligor. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and, thus, are recorded on a net sales recognition basis. As we enter into contracts with third-party service providers or vendors and our clients, we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales. We determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an agent or broker. Under gross sales recognition, the selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction, and there are no costs of goods sold.\n \u2022 incremental income tax expense related to U.S. federal tax reform of $13.4 million.  The results of operations for 2016 include the following items:\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities. During 2017, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt under our revolving facility, TLA and accounts receivable securitization facility (\u201cABS facility\u201d) of $269.3 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $141.0 million. During 2016, we made net combined repayments on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $49.5 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million. In 2016, we also funded $50.0 million of repurchases of our common stock. During 2015, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $28.0 million and made net repayments under our inventory financing facility of $16.5 million. In 2015, we also funded $91.8 million of repurchases of our common stock.\n \u2022 We were named #1 in Microsoft Azure consumption in the region for 2017; and \nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements, including the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements.\nUndistributed Foreign Earnings\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nSales are recognized when title and risk of loss are passed to the client, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our standard sales terms are F.O.B. shipping point or equivalent, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client. However, because we either (i) have a general practice of covering client losses while products are in transit despite title and risk of loss contractually transferring at the point of shipment or (ii) have specifically stated F.O.B. destination contractual terms with the client, delivery is not deemed to have occurred until the point in time when the product is received by the client. We make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe establish liabilities for potentially unfavorable outcomes associated with uncertain tax positions taken on specific tax matters. These liabilities are based on management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. There may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in subsequent recognition or derecognition of a tax position based on all the available information at the time. If material adjustments are warranted, it could affect our effective tax rate.\nAcquisition-related Expenses. During 2017, we incurred $3.2 million in direct third-party transaction costs related to the acquisition of Datalink in North America and $106,000 in such costs related to the acquisition of Caase.com in EMEA. Comparatively, during 2016, we incurred $4.3 million in such costs related to the acquisition of Datalink in North America and $169,000 in such costs related to the acquisition of Ignia in APAC. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of acquisitions.\n \u2022 transaction costs totaling $3.3 million, $2.5 million net of tax, associated with the acquisitions of Caase.com and Datalink; \nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInflation\nNet cash used in investing activities. Capital expenditures of $19.2 million, $12.3 million and $13.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were primarily related to technology and facility enhancements. We expect total capital expenditures in 2018 to be between $15.0 million and $20.0 million, primarily for technology-related upgrade projects and the integration of prior acquisitions.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was 43.0% compared to 39.3% in 2016. The increase in the tax rate from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to the effect of U.S. federal tax reform that was enacted in December 2017, which accounted for 8.4% of our effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2017 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the effect of U.S. federal tax reform enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017, as previously noted, as well as state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefits, and increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2017 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities reflect our net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and write-offs and write-downs of assets, as well as changes in asset and liability balances. Net earnings for 2017 was also adjusted for the loss on sale of our Russia business, which included a non-cash charge for the release of our cumulative translation adjustment balance upon sale of the foreign entity. As noted previously, our net sales grew 22% in 2017 and in particular, our North America net sales grew 30%. This level of growth required significant working capital investments as we experienced higher demand for inventory positions with key clients and, at the same time, our accounts receivable balances began to age as collection efforts did not keep up with the growth. The 2017 results also reflect the collection of a single significant receivable from a client in the fourth quarter of 2016 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $160 million was due and paid in January 2017, as noted previously. Further impacting our operating cash flows was the fact that we report cash flows associated with trade payables financed under our inventory financing facility in the financing section of our statement of cash flows. In 2017, and most notably in the fourth quarter, we expanded the use of that facility with certain vendors. Had we not leveraged the facility during 2017, the net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $141.0 million that are reflected as cash flows provided by financing activities would have been included within trade payables, which are reflected in the operating activities section of our statement of cash flows. The increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2017 to support specific client engagements. The decrease in deferred revenue was a result of revenue recognition in 2017 on a number of larger client transactions in North America for which monies had been collected from clients prior to December 31, 2016, in advance of meeting the criteria for revenue recognition.\nWe anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with the funds available under our financing facilities, will be adequate to support our cash and working capital requirements for operations as well as other strategic investments over the next 12 months. We expect existing cash and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating cash activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as capital expenditures, repurchases of our common stock and debt repayments, for at least the next 12 months.\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nWe review property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment, our asset impairment review assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or the asset group plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset or the asset group (if any) and compares that value to the carrying value. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount. This approach uses our estimates of future market growth, forecasted net sales and costs, expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n Cash and Cash Flow\nDuring 2017, we used $305.4 million in operating activities, including approximately $186.9 million, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, utilized to fund the acquisitions of Datalink and Caase.com. We ended the year with $105.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $307.9 million of debt outstanding under our long-term debt facilities.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the goodwill impairment test is not required. In completing a quantitative test for a potential impairment of goodwill, we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value, including goodwill. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit, including the market and income approaches. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment, or both. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the Company, future market growth, forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. To ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units, we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n Net sales in North America increased 30%, or $1.2 billion, in 2017 compared to 2016, including 17% year over year growth in our core business driven by higher volume of sales from new and existing clients, and the addition of Datalink, which reported $524.3 million in net sales in 2017. Net sales of hardware, software and services increased 37%, 14% and 40%, respectively, year over year. The improvement in net sales in the hardware category reflects higher volume of sales to large enterprise clients and was due primarily to strong growth in data center solutions as well as client devices. Strong growth in our core business was complemented by the addition of Datalink, which accounted for approximately 29% of the year over year growth in the hardware category. The increase in the software category was also affected by the acquisition of Datalink, which accounted for approximately 70% of the year over year increase. The increase in services net sales reflects the addition of Datalink to our business, offset partially by declines in technical services projects in our core business in 2017 compared to 2016. Services net sales during 2017 also reflected the continued trend toward higher sales of cloud-based offerings and a higher mix of software maintenance sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Our net sales by offering category for North America for 2017 and 2016 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n (b) Calculated as average inventories (excluding inventories not available for sale) divided by daily costs of goods sold. Average inventories is calculated as the sum of the balances of inventories at the beginning of the period plus inventories at the end of the period divided by two. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days. \nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nRevenue is recognized from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license, but in no case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met (i.e., evidence of the arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable).\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n III. Estimated interest payments of $5.7 million in 2018, $5.2 million in 2019, $4.5 million in 2020 and $2.0 million in the first six months of 2021, based on the current debt balance at December 31, 2017 of $166.3 million under our TLA, multiplied by the floating interest rate applicable at December 31, 2017 of 3.57% per annum. \n (d) As a result of approved severance and restructuring plans, we expect future cash expenditures related to employee termination benefits. See further discussion in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \n\nAcquisition-related Expenses. During 2016, we incurred $169,000 in direct third-party transaction costs related to the acquisition of Ignia and $4.3 million in such costs related to the acquisition of Datalink that was completed on January 6, 2017. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of acquisitions.\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses increased 6%, or $1.2 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased approximately 90 basis points to 13.5% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 7% compared to the prior year. The year over year increase is primarily driven by higher variable compensation as a result of the increase in gross profit year over year and increased selling and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of Ignia, a business technology consulting and managed services provider, effective September 1, 2016.\nWe consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nFinancing Facilities\nDetails about segment results of operations can be found in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n (a) Calculated as the balance of accounts receivable, net at the end of the period divided by daily net sales. Daily net sales is calculated as net sales for the quarter divided by 92 days. \nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nIn December 2017, U.S. federal tax reform was enacted as part of the Tax Act. The change in tax law required a remeasurement of our deferred tax balances. In addition, the change in tax law included provisions requiring mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. Due to the enactment date and complexities of the new law, we have not completed our accounting related to these items. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, issued on December 22, 2017, we have concluded that the U.S. income taxes attributable to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred income taxes, the mandatory deemed repatriation provision and the state tax effects of these items are provisional amounts.\nAcquisitions\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n North America's selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, or $4.7 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, but decreased approximately 30 basis points year to year as a percentage of net sales to 10.1% of net sales in 2016. Teammate benefits expense, including healthcare expenses, increased $6.0 million year over year due to an increase in healthcare claims, and variable compensation increased $4.6 million as a result of the increase in net sales and gross profit year over year. These increases in expenses during 2016 compared to 2015 were partially offset by a decline in the provision for losses on accounts receivable of $3.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to favorable collection results and a decrease in salaries and wages and contract labor of $2.7 million resulting from cost reduction initiatives implemented earlier in 2016 across our North America business. Our results for 2015 included a non-cash charge of $800,000 to reduce the carrying amount of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nThroughout the \u201cOverview\u201d and \u201cResults of Operations\u201d sections of \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d we refer to changes in net sales, gross profit, selling and administrative expenses and earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and in North America, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In computing these amounts and percentages, we compare the current period amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior period amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted average translation rate for the current period.\nSelling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nEMEA's gross profit remained flat in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit was up 7% in 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 30 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the positive effect on gross margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis within the net sales line item. Changes in the mix and size of transactions and an increase in partner funding earlier in 2016 also contributed to the margin improvement during 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, we recognized an increase in margin resulting from higher fees from enterprise software agreements during 2016 compared to 2015.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2017, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $4.0 million, $4.9 million and $104,000, respectively. The North America charges related to severance actions taken to realign roles and responsibilities subsequent to the acquisition of Datalink in January 2017, as well as a headcount reduction as part of cost reduction initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2017. The EMEA charges primarily related to headcount reductions in France, Germany and the Netherlands as part our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives in EMEA. The APAC charges primarily related to severance actions taken subsequent to the acquisition of Ignia. Current period charges were offset by adjustments for changes in estimates of previous accruals as cash payments were made during 2017. During 2016, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $3.0 million, $1.5 million and $118,000, respectively. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\nThe table above excludes $4.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including $287,000 related to accrued interest, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See further discussion in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2016, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $3.0 million, $1.5 million and $118,000, respectively. The North America charges related to a headcount reduction as part of cost reduction initiatives early in 2016 noted previously, while the EMEA charges related to significant restructuring activities, primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany and France, as we worked to reduce our selling and administrative expenses in EMEA. Current period charges were offset by adjustments for changes in estimates of previous accruals as cash payments were made during 2016. During 2015, North America and EMEA recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $1.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively. APAC did not record any severance expense in 2015. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\n V. We estimate that we will owe $7.5 million in future years in connection with the obligations to perform asset-retirement activities that are conditional on a future event. \nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n \u2022 We continued our focus on tight expense control across the business. \n Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 24%, or $175.5 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, with gross margin increasing approximately 20 basis points to 13.7% of net sales. Our gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n \u2022 a gain of $338,000 on the sale of our Bloomingdale, Illinois real estate; and \n\nOur consolidated debt balance that can be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter under our revolving facility, our TLA and our ABS facility is limited by certain financial covenants, particularly a maximum leverage ratio. The maximum leverage ratio is calculated as aggregate debt outstanding divided by the sum of the Company's trailing twelve month net earnings (loss) plus (i) interest expense, excluding non-cash imputed interest on our inventory financing facility, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation, (v) extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash losses or expenses and (vi) certain cash restructuring and acquisition-related charges and synergies, not to exceed a specified cap (\u201cadjusted earnings\u201d). The maximum leverage ratio permitted under the facilities was increased to 3.50 times trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings in connection with the acquisition of Datalink in January 2017. We anticipate that we will be in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio requirements, which will decrease to 3.25 in 2018, over the next four quarters. However, a significant drop in the Company's adjusted earnings would limit the amount of indebtedness that could be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter to a level that would be below the Company's consolidated maximum facility amounts. Based on the maximum permitted leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017, the Company's debt balance that could have been outstanding under our revolving facility, TLA and ABS facility was the full amount of the maximum borrowing capacity of $766.3 million.\nThe information contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report concerning a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including our expected dates of adoption and the estimated effects on our results of operations and financial condition, is incorporated by reference herein.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our long-term debt balance includes $25.0 million outstanding under our $250.0 million ABS facility and $117.5 million outstanding under our $350.0 million revolving facility. In connection with the acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017, we amended our revolving facility to expand the facility by $175.0 million in the form of a TLA that requires amortization payments in years one through five. As of December 31, 2017, we had $166.3 million outstanding under our TLA. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a description of our amendment to our revolving facility in connection with our acquisition of Datalink.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ from our estimates. Members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $138.1 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 10 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2017 compared to 2016.\n2016 Compared to 2015\n \u2022 We generated double digit gross profit growth; and \nAt December 31, 2017, our contractual obligations for continuing operations were as follows (in thousands):\n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $4.9 million, $4.3 million net of tax; \nAs previously noted, the sales mix among our hardware, software and services categories for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 have been reclassified to conform to changes made to the current year presentation, as reflected in the following results of operations discussion for these periods. These changes in classification had no effect on previously reported total net sales, total costs of goods sold or gross profit amounts.\nThe results of operations for 2015 include the following items:\nOur consolidated cash flow operating metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n In EMEA, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $48,586,000 that were previously reported as part of our software product category in 2016 were reclassified to services to conform to the current year presentation.\nNotes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report also include: a description of our financing facilities; amounts outstanding; amounts available and weighted average borrowings and interest rates during the year.\nWe also have an agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable - inventory financing facility in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a \u201ccomponent\u201d). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management of the segment regularly reviews the operating results of that component. When two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, the components may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. Insight has three reporting units, which are equivalent to our operating segments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nIncome Taxes\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2016 and 2015 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on such balances and to higher average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances during 2016.\nWe perform an annual review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, and that assessment requires a significant amount of judgment. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations. Any adverse change in these factors, among others, could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n (1) Our consolidated statements of operations data includes results of the following acquisitions from their respective dates of acquisition: Caase.com from September 26, 2017, Datalink from January 6, 2017, Ignia from September 1, 2016 and BlueMetal from October 1, 2015. \n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider past operating results, future market growth, forecasted earnings, historical and projected taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance. If we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized, then all or part of the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.\nContractual Obligations\nOur strategy includes the possible acquisition of or investments in other businesses to expand or complement our operations or to add certain services capabilities. The magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of suitable candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions. Financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash, incurrence of additional debt, issuance of stock or some combination of the three. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our acquisitions of Caase.com on September 26, 2017 and Datalink on January 6, 2017 and the amendment to our revolving facility to fund, in part, the acquisition of Datalink.\n \u2022 In APAC: \nWe leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our partners and suppliers to deliver products to our clients without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. We recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis when the product is received by the client. We recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we control the transaction as the primary obligor for product fulfillment in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the client, we set the price of the product charged to the client, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our clients to determine their hardware and software specifications.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 19% in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher borrowing rates and higher average daily balances under our debt facilities in 2016 compared to 2015, while imputed interest under our inventory financing facility remained flat from 2015 to 2016 at $3.4 million. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the current portion of our long-term debt relates to our capital leases and other financing obligations as well as the amortization payments due in 2018 under our TLA. Our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\n In North America, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $270,000 and $87,984,000 that were previously reported as part of our hardware and software product categories, respectively, in 2016, were reclassified to services to conform to the current year presentation.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n \u2022 We sold our non-strategic business in Russia; \n In APAC, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $9,000 and $10,991,000 that were previously reported as part of our hardware and software product categories, respectively, in 2016, were reclassified to services to conform to the current year presentation.\n North America's gross profit in 2016 increased 5% compared to 2015, and as a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 10 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increases in supplier discounts year over year as we took advantage of early pay discounts offered by certain of our partners, which generated a 6 basis point improvement in margin year over year. During 2016, we also recognized a $2.2 million insurance settlement as a reduction of cost of sales due to the nature of the related insured loss previously recorded. The insurance settlement accounted for 6 basis points of the year over year margin expansion during 2016 compared to 2015. Although an increase in higher margin consulting services sales generated a 15 basis point improvement in gross margin year over year, the increase was partially offset by a decline in margin generated by sales of warranty services of 12 basis points year to year.\nPartner Funding\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n During the year ended December 31, 2017, our consolidated net sales from the provision of services was approximately 10% of net sales. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we began reporting, on the face of our consolidated statement of operations, net sales from the provision of services and the related costs of goods sold separately from net sales of products and the related costs of goods. For comparability purposes, the presentation of net sales and costs of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. These changes in presentation had no effect on previously reported total net sales, total costs of goods sold or gross profit amounts.\n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $4.6 million, $3.3 million net of tax; \n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n \u2022 We invested significantly to support cloud and services sales in Australia, which we expect will improve our growth trends in 2018. \nNet sales in EMEA increased 1%, or $16.9 million, in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. Net sales of hardware and services were up 11% and 15%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of software declined 7% year to year. The increase in hardware net sales was due primarily to higher volume sales of client devices, storage and networking solutions to public sector clients. The increase in services net sales was due primarily to increased sales of license consulting services and partner delivered services to new and existing clients across the region. In addition, a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction, are included in the services category. The decrease in software net sales was driven by a single significant transaction during the prior year period affecting the year over year comparison. Our net sales by offering category for EMEA for 2017 and 2016 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nNet of tax amounts referenced above were computed using the statutory tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expenses were recorded, adjusted for the effects of valuation allowances on net operating losses in certain jurisdictions.\n \u2022 the results of the acquisitions of Caase.com and Datalink, from their respective acquisition dates; \n \u2022 In North America: \nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 4%, or $26.8 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, with gross margin increasing approximately 20 basis points to 13.5% of net sales. Our gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities and was relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nItem 7 of this report.

The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, which have been audited by KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, are included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n \u2022 an impairment loss of $800,000 to further reduce the carrying amount of our previously owned real estate in Bloomingdale, Illinois to its estimated fair value less costs to sell; and \nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses decreased 3%, or $5.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased approximately 10 basis points to 12.0% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% compared to the prior year. The increase in expenses (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was primarily driven by increased salaries and wages and teammate benefits expenses attributed to higher average cost per head in conjunction with our investments in sales and services related headcount to support services and cloud growth across the region.\nWe receive payments and credits from partners, including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs, volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs. Partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold. Partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the related inventory is sold. Partner funding received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as it is earned as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs. Consideration that exceeds the specific, incremental, identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold. Changes in estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs could have a material effect on our results of operations and our cash flows.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nIn certain arrangements, we may provide a combination of hardware and software products as well as services. Services that are performed by us in conjunction with hardware and software sales that are completed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product are recognized upon delivery, when title passes to the client, for the hardware sale. Net sales of services that are performed at client locations are primarily service-only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed. The total consideration for an arrangement with multiple deliverables is allocated to all deliverables that represent a separate unit of accounting using the relative selling price method.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n (a) Reflects the $25.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2017 under our ABS facility as due in June 2019, the date at which the facility matures, $117.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2017 under our revolving facility as due in June 2021, the date at which the facility matures, and $166.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2017 under our TLA. The TLA requires amortization payments of 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5% and 15% of the original principal balance in years one through five, respectively, to be paid quarterly through March 31, 2021, with the remaining balance of $107.2 million due at maturity on June 23, 2021.

Net sales increased 22%, or $1.2 billion, in 2017 compared to 2016. Net sales of products (hardware and software) increased 21% and net sales of services increased 36% in 2017 compared to 2016 (as reclassified). Our net sales by operating segment for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nIn 2015, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflected increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. However, the 2015 results were also affected by the single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2015 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was due and paid in January 2016, as noted previously. The increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2015, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. As a result, cash flows from operating activities in 2015 exceeded our historical average annual cash flow generation of $80 million to $120 million.\nWe have historically not been adversely affected by inflation, as technological advances and competition within the IT industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short. This requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales. We believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients, as prices charged by us are not set by long-term contracts; however, as a result of competitive pressure, there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients.", "item_7_text": "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n IV. Amounts totaling $197,000 through 2018 for other contractual obligations. \nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses increased 3%, or $4.0 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased approximately 10 basis points to 12.1% of net sales in 2017. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 4% compared to 2016. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by a $3.1 million increase in salaries and wages and teammate benefits expenses due to increased headcount. This year over year increase in selling and administrative expenses was offset partially by a decrease in amortization expense during 2017 compared to 2016, as intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions were fully amortized in the third quarter of 2016.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOperating Expenses.\n \u2022 the loss on the sale of our Russia business totaling $3.6 million; \nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses increased 19%, or $4.6 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased approximately 350 basis points to 17.0% of net sales in 2017. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 16% compared to 2016. The year over year increase was primarily driven by increased selling and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of Ignia, effective September 1, 2016, which accounted for over half of the year over year increase in selling and administrative expenses. Additionally, salaries and wages expenses increased as we invested to support growth in cloud and services sales.\nOperating Expenses.\nWe recognize revenue for professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis based upon hours incurred as the services are performed and amounts are earned. Net sales for these service engagements are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nEMEA's gross profit in 2017 increased 2% compared to 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit was up 4% in 2017 compared to 2016. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 10 basis points year over year. The year over year improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to a 60 basis point increase in services margin due to a higher volume of higher margin services net sales during 2017 compared to 2016 as well as the positive effect on services margin that resulted from the higher volume of sales that were recorded on a net sales recognition basis in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement in gross margin resulting from higher margin services net sales was partially offset by a net decrease in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, of 50 basis points during 2017 compared to 2016. The decline in product margin primarily resulted from lower margins on large enterprise and public sector deals transacted during 2017.\nThe following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nIn North America, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $270,000 and $87,984,000 that were previously reported as part of our hardware and software product categories, respectively, in 2016, and fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $24,000 and $74,101,000 that were previously reported as part of our hardware and software product categories, respectively, in 2015, were reclassified to services to conform to the current year presentation.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n North America's selling and administrative expenses increased 32%, or $129.5 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased approximately 10 basis points year over year as a percentage of net sales to 10.2% of net sales in 2017. The increase in expenses reflects the addition of Datalink to our North America business effective January 2017 and an increase in selling and administrative expenses in our core business of approximately 5% compared to 2016. The addition of Datalink was the primary driver for the $62.4 million increase in salaries and wages, contract labor and teammate benefit expenses for 2017 compared to 2016, as well as year over year increases in travel and entertainment, facilities and marketing expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense also increased approximately $6.0 million year over year, as amortization expense of $11.5 million, associated with the intangible assets acquired from Datalink, was offset partially by the year over year effect of intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions being fully amortized in the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, increased sales and gross profit in 2017 compared to 2016, resulted in a $37.0 million increase in variable compensation year over year.\nOverview\n \nIn conjunction with this change in presentation, because fees earned from activities reported net are considered services revenues, we reclassified certain revenue streams for which we act as the agent in the transaction to net sales from services. Previously, we included these net revenue streams within our software and, to a lesser extent, hardware sales mix categories based on the type of product being sold (e.g., fees earned for the sale of software maintenance and certain software licenses were included in software sales and fees earned for the sale of certain third-party provided training were included in hardware sales when we historically disclosed and analyzed our sales mix). For comparability purposes, the sales mix among our hardware, software and services categories for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net sales amounts.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n (2) Excludes obligations under our inventory financing facility of $319.5 million, $154.9 million, $106.3 million, $122.8 million and $115.3 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We do not include these obligations in total debt because we have not in the past incurred, and in the future do not expect to incur, any interest payments due under this facility. These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable-inventory financing facility on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \nOur cash conversion cycle was 20 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of four days from the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to an increase in DPOs in North America driven by a single significant payment to a supplier that was due and paid in January 2016, after the resolution of certain invoicing issues with the supplier. Although we did not pay the supplier until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2015 under normal credit terms.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAlthough we set purchase targets with our partners tied to the amount of supplier reimbursements we receive, we have no material contractual purchase obligations with our partners.\nOur revolving facility, our TLA and our ABS facility contain various covenants customary for transactions of this type, including limitations on the payment of dividends and the requirement that we comply with maximum leverage and minimum fixed charge ratio requirements, comply with a minimum receivable requirement and meet monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. If we fail to comply with these covenants, the lenders would be able to demand payment within a specified time period. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Further, the terms of the ABS facility identify various circumstances that would result in an \u201camortization event\u201d under the facility. As of December 31, 2017, no such \u201camortization event\u201d had occurred.\nAdditional information about recent U.S. federal tax reform, the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions can be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated cash flow information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2016 was 39.3% compared to 36.4% in 2015. The increase in the tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to the effect of a change in tax law that was enacted in December 2016 related to the taxation of foreign currency translation gains or losses arising from qualified business units and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016. The effective tax rate in 2016 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions and state taxes in the United States as well as the tax law change during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016, as noted previously. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2016 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\nOn a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2017, our net sales of $6.7 billion increased 22% compared to 2016. This increase reflects growth of 20% in our core business and the addition of Datalink to our results of operations beginning January 6, 2017. As a result, for the first time in the Company's history, net sales from the provision of services approximated 10%. Our gross profit increased faster than sales, increasing by 24%, or $175.5 million, compared to 2016, also up 24% year over year excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated gross margin improved approximately 20 basis points to 13.7% of net sales in 2017. This increase reflects solid growth in net sales and gross profit in our core business combined with the addition of Datalink. Selling and administrative expenses increased $138.1 million, or 24%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The year over year change reflects the addition of Datalink and an increase of 5% in selling and administrative expenses in our core business. We reported earnings from operations of $179.3 million in 2017, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year, which represented 2.7% of net sales, consistent with the prior year. Our effective tax rate in 2017 was 43.0%, driven by the effects of U.S. federal tax reform enacted in December 2017. This higher tax rate in 2017 compares to our effective tax rate of 39.3% in 2016 and 36.4% in 2015. Net earnings and diluted net earnings per share were $90.7 million and $2.50, respectively, in 2017. In 2016, we reported net earnings of $84.7 million and diluted net earnings per share of $2.32. In 2015, we reported net earnings of $75.9 million and diluted net earnings per share of $1.98.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nSelling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n (d) Calculated as DSOs plus DIOs, less DPOs.  Our cash conversion cycle was 35 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 14 days in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our 2016 cash conversion cycle was below our target range of 20 to 25 days as a result of unusually high DPOs associated with the $160 million payment timing difference in North America at the end of the prior year period, as discussed below. Our 2017 cash conversion cycle was above our target range due to the increases in our inventory and accounts receivable balances noted above. We expect working capital trends to return to normalized levels and have action plans in place to improve our cash flow efficiency in 2018.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNet sales by category for North America, EMEA and APAC were as follows for 2017 and 2016 (as reclassified):\n (e) The table above includes: \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 122%, or $10.5 million, in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to borrowings under our Term Loan A (\u201cTLA\u201d) as well as higher borrowing rates and higher average daily balances under our other financing facilities, in 2017 compared to 2016, while imputed interest under our inventory financing facility increased $3.3 million from 2016 to 2017 to $6.7 million. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n \u2022 We gained hardware market share from competitors according to third-party data, reflecting strong growth in data center solutions as well as devices; and \nGeneral\n (c) Calculated as the sum of the balances of accounts payable - trade and accounts payable - inventory financing facility at the end of the period divided by daily costs of goods sold. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days. \nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nWe recognize revenue for sales of services ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided if there is no discernible pattern of recognition of the cost to perform the service. Billings for such services that are made in advance of the related revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We are also subject to various government agency, client and partner audits. We continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual. An accrual is made if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows. Additional information about contingencies can be found in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNet Sales. Net sales increased 2%, or $112.4 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of products (hardware and software) increased 1% and net sales of services increased 14% in 2016 (as reclassified) compared to 2015 (as reclassified). Our net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDuring 2017 we acquired Caase.com and Datalink for $6.0 million and $180.9 million, respectively, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. During 2016, we acquired Ignia for $10.8 million, net of cash acquired, and during 2015, we acquired BlueMetal for $44.2 million, net of cash acquired.\nOur gross profit across the business and related to product versus services sales are, and will continue to be, impacted by partner incentives, which can change significantly in the amounts made available and the related product or services sales being incentivized by the partner. These changes could impact our results of operations to the extent we are unable to remediate and respond to them.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nThe results of operations for 2017 include the following items:\nThe aggregate availability for vendor purchases under our inventory financing facility is $325,000,000. From time to time and at our option, we may request to increase the aggregate amount available under the inventory financing facility by up to an aggregate of $25,000,000, subject to customary conditions. The facility matures on June 23, 2021. Additionally, the facility may be renewed under certain circumstances described in the agreement for successive 12-month periods. Interest does not accrue on accounts payable under this facility provided the accounts payable are paid within stated vendor terms (typically 60 days).\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAPAC's gross profit increased 15% in 2017 compared to 2016, with gross margin increasing to 22.0% in 2017 from 18.2% in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit increased 13% in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement in gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to the positive effect on services margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, an increase in the mix of higher margin services net sales and the margin contribution from increases in hardware net sales during 2017 compared to 2016.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n\nWe expect that cash flow from operations will be used, at least partially, to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms we grant to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts. We intend to use cash generated in 2018 in excess of working capital needs to support our capital expenditures for the year, to repurchase shares of our common stock and to pay down our debt balances. We also may use cash to fund potential acquisitions.\n \u2022 In EMEA: \nFull year 2017 financial and operational highlights included the following:\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n I. Estimated interest payments of $603,000 in 2018 and $301,000 in the first six months of 2019, based on the current debt balance at December 31, 2017 of $25.0 million under our ABS facility, multiplied by the floating interest rate applicable at December 31, 2017 of 2.41% per annum. \n \u2022 the results of the acquisition of Ignia effective September 1, 2016; \nInterest Income. Interest income for 2017 and 2016 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The slight increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on such balances and to higher average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances during 2017.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n \u2022 We completed the acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017 and completed the IT systems and back office integration activities by mid-year. We achieved expense synergies ahead of our expectations and are pleased with the overall financial results of the business in its first year as part of Insight; \nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $337,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. Selling and administrative expenses decreased approximately 20 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2016 compared to 2015.\nWe are a Fortune 500 global IT provider helping businesses of all sizes - from small and medium sized firms to worldwide enterprises, governments, schools and health care organizations - define, architect, implement and manage Intelligent Technology SolutionsTM in North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d); and Asia-Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d). We empower our clients to manage their IT environments so they can drive meaningful business outcomes today and transform their operations for tomorrow. Our offerings in North America and certain countries in EMEA and APAC include hardware, software and services. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments are largely software and certain software-related services.\nAPAC's gross profit increased 12% in 2016 compared to 2015, with gross margin increasing to 18.2% in 2016 from 16.0% in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit increased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015. The improvement in gross margin in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to the positive effect on margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, an increase in the mix of higher margin services net sales, higher partner funding and an increase in hardware sales during 2016 compared to 2015.\n In EMEA, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $48,586,000 and $43,388,000 that were previously reported as part of our software product category in 2016 and 2015, respectively, were reclassified to services to conform to the current year presentation.\n Net sales in North America increased 4%, or $148.3 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of hardware and services (as reclassified) increased 5% and 12%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of software (as reclassified) decreased 1% year to year. The improvement in net sales in the hardware category was due primarily to higher sales of client devices, servers and storage products. The increase in services net sales reflects the BlueMetal acquisition in October 2015 as well as organic growth in technical services projects. Services net sales during 2016 also reflected the continued trend toward higher sales of cloud-based offerings and a higher mix of software maintenance sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Our net sales by offering category for North America for 2016 (as reclassified) and 2015 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nWe have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, which include guaranties and indemnifications. These arrangements are discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We believe that none of our off-balance sheet arrangements have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities.\nIn 2016, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflected increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015. However, the 2016 results were also affected by a single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2016 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $160 million was due and paid in January 2017, as noted previously. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a similar experience with a significant receivable collected in the quarter for which the payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was not made until the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the effects of these two individually significant timing differences, cash flow from operations would have been nominal for 2016. Additionally, the increase in accounts payable reflected as cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was affected by the increased use of our inventory financing facility in 2016 to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers. Increases in accounts payable under this facility were reflected as cash provided by financing activities, as discussed below. Had these purchases been made without using the inventory financing facility during 2016, the net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million that were reflected as cash flows from financing activities would have been reflected as an increase in accounts payable, which would have been an increase in cash provided by operating activities. We used more working capital in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, as our sales growth was weighted to the last two months of the current year. The $50.1 million increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2016, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. The $28.9 million increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2016, to support specific client engagements and hardware sale transactions in transit to clients as of December 31, 2016 such that delivery was not deemed to have occurred until the product was received by the client in early January 2017.\n \u2022 the repurchase of approximately 3.3 million shares of the Company's common stock for $91.8 million. \nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\n \u2022 We continued to transform into a cloud and solutions business, invested in technical and pre-sales and service delivery teammates focused on cloud technologies and grew our services sales by 15%; \n \u2022 transaction costs totaling $4.4 million, $4.2 million net of tax, associated with the acquisitions of Ignia and Datalink; \nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n \u2022 the repurchase of approximately 1.9 million shares of the Company's common stock for $50 million. \nOur primary uses of cash during 2017 were to fund working capital requirements, pay down our debt balances, fund capital expenditures and acquire Caase.com and Datalink. Operating activities used $305.4 million in cash in 2017. Both the 2017 and 2016 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end, whereby a single significant receivable was collected from a client in the fourth quarter of the year for which the related payment to the supplier was due and paid in January of the following year, as discussed in more detail below. During 2017, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt facilities of $269.3 million and acquired Caase.com and Datalink for $6.0 million and $180.9 million, respectively, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. Capital expenditures were $19.2 million in 2017, a 57% increase from 2016, reflecting higher IT investments in our core ERP systems and e-commerce and digital marketing platforms year over year. Cash and cash equivalent balances in 2017 were positively affected by $15.9 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nNorth America's gross profit in 2017 increased 32% compared to 2016, and as a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 10 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a net increase in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, of 30 basis points year over year. The net increase in product margin was due primarily to improvements in hardware and software product margin during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the acquisition of Datalink, which includes sales of data center products at higher gross margins then in our core business. The positive effect of the Datalink acquisition was partially offset by lower product margin in our core business due to a higher mix of business with large enterprise clients, where margins tend to be lower than other client groups. Services margin improvement year over year of 11 basis points was driven by an increase in margin generated by sales of warranty services during 2017 compared to 2016, which was driven by the acquisition of Datalink. These increases in margin were offset partially by a decrease in margin from lower fees from enterprise software agreements of 23 basis points during 2017 compared to 2016. The year over year comparison was also affected by a $2.2 million insurance settlement recognized during 2016 as a reduction of cost of sales due to the nature of the related insured loss previously recorded.\nCash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States. As a result of the U.S. federal tax reform enacted in December 2017, all undistributed foreign earnings are deemed distributed. We provided for U.S. income and withholding taxes on the earnings deemed distributed from all of our foreign subsidiaries during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $87.1 million in cash and cash equivalents in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, the majority of our foreign cash resides in the Netherlands, Canada and Australia. Certain of these cash balances will be remitted to the United States by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business or though actual dividend distributions.\n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $9.0 million, $7.3 million net of tax; and \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNet sales by category for North America, EMEA and APAC were as follows for 2016 (as reclassified) and 2015 (as reclassified):\nNet sales in APAC decreased 2%, or $3.3 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales in 2016 remained flat compared to 2015. An increase in services and hardware net sales year over year was offset by a decrease in software net sales during 2016 compared to 2015. Our net sales by offering category for APAC for 2016 (as reclassified) and 2015 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Purchased Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n (c) Amounts in the table above exclude non-cancellable rental income of approximately $1.6 million due in less than one year and a total of approximately $1.6 million due in years one through three. \nNet sales in APAC decreased 5%, or $8.7 million, in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales decreased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016. Increases in hardware and services net sales year over year were offset by a decrease in software net sales during 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from the timing of a single client agreement in the public sector that historically transacted in the fourth quarter but instead transacted in the first quarter of 2018 this year. The growth in hardware net sales was primarily due to our continued expansion of hardware offerings in this market. The growth in services net sales resulted from the contributions of Ignia, as well as a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and cloud subscriptions products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis in 2017 compared to 2016. Our net sales by offering category for APAC for 2017 and 2016 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this report. Additionally, any references to our \u201ccore\u201d business exclude Datalink's results subsequent to the Datalink acquisition.\nAdditionally, we sell certain professional services contracts on a fixed fee basis. Revenues for fixed fee professional services contracts are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. Net sales for these service contracts are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\n (b) As of December 31, 2017, this amount has been included in our contractual obligations table above as being due in less than 1 year due to the 30- to 120-day stated vendor terms. See further discussion in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \n \u2022 the results of the acquisition of BlueMetal effective October 1, 2015; \nSales Recognition\nOur cash conversion cycle was 14 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of six days from the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to an 11 day increase in DPOs driven by a single significant payment to a supplier in North America that was due and paid in January 2017. Although the payment to the supplier was not due until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2016 under normal credit terms. Both the 2016 and 2015 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end; however, the magnitude of the 2016 transaction had a greater effect on DPOs. The computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 includes a payable to a supplier of $160 million, and the computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 30, 2015 includes a payable to a supplier of $60 million, both of which do not have corresponding accounts receivable outstanding as of the end of the respective periods.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nWhile the ABS facility has a stated maximum amount, the actual availability under the ABS facility is limited by the quantity and quality of the underlying accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2017, qualified receivables were sufficient to permit access to the full $250.0 million under the ABS facility.\nNet sales in EMEA decreased 2%, or $32.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of software (as reclassified) were up 1% year over year, while net sales of hardware and services (as reclassified) were down 9% and 1%, respectively, year to year. The increase in software net sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by increased volume with large enterprise clients. The decrease in services net sales was due primarily to the relative impact year over year of the volume of sales of software maintenance and cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, offset partially by increased sales of license consulting services and partner delivered third-party services to new and existing clients across the region. Our net sales by offering category for EMEA for 2016 (as reclassified) and 2015 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nWe sell certain third-party service contracts and software maintenance and cloud or software-as-a-service subscription products for which we are not the primary obligor. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and, thus, are recorded on a net sales recognition basis. As we enter into contracts with third-party service providers or vendors and our clients, we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales. We determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an agent or broker. Under gross sales recognition, the selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction, and there are no costs of goods sold.\n \u2022 incremental income tax expense related to U.S. federal tax reform of $13.4 million.  The results of operations for 2016 include the following items:\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities. During 2017, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt under our revolving facility, TLA and accounts receivable securitization facility (\u201cABS facility\u201d) of $269.3 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $141.0 million. During 2016, we made net combined repayments on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $49.5 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million. In 2016, we also funded $50.0 million of repurchases of our common stock. During 2015, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $28.0 million and made net repayments under our inventory financing facility of $16.5 million. In 2015, we also funded $91.8 million of repurchases of our common stock.\n \u2022 We were named #1 in Microsoft Azure consumption in the region for 2017; and \nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements, including the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements.\nUndistributed Foreign Earnings\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nSales are recognized when title and risk of loss are passed to the client, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our standard sales terms are F.O.B. shipping point or equivalent, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client. However, because we either (i) have a general practice of covering client losses while products are in transit despite title and risk of loss contractually transferring at the point of shipment or (ii) have specifically stated F.O.B. destination contractual terms with the client, delivery is not deemed to have occurred until the point in time when the product is received by the client. We make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe establish liabilities for potentially unfavorable outcomes associated with uncertain tax positions taken on specific tax matters. These liabilities are based on management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. There may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in subsequent recognition or derecognition of a tax position based on all the available information at the time. If material adjustments are warranted, it could affect our effective tax rate.\nAcquisition-related Expenses. During 2017, we incurred $3.2 million in direct third-party transaction costs related to the acquisition of Datalink in North America and $106,000 in such costs related to the acquisition of Caase.com in EMEA. Comparatively, during 2016, we incurred $4.3 million in such costs related to the acquisition of Datalink in North America and $169,000 in such costs related to the acquisition of Ignia in APAC. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of acquisitions.\n \u2022 transaction costs totaling $3.3 million, $2.5 million net of tax, associated with the acquisitions of Caase.com and Datalink; \nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInflation\nNet cash used in investing activities. Capital expenditures of $19.2 million, $12.3 million and $13.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were primarily related to technology and facility enhancements. We expect total capital expenditures in 2018 to be between $15.0 million and $20.0 million, primarily for technology-related upgrade projects and the integration of prior acquisitions.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was 43.0% compared to 39.3% in 2016. The increase in the tax rate from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to the effect of U.S. federal tax reform that was enacted in December 2017, which accounted for 8.4% of our effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2017 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the effect of U.S. federal tax reform enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017, as previously noted, as well as state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefits, and increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2017 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities reflect our net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and write-offs and write-downs of assets, as well as changes in asset and liability balances. Net earnings for 2017 was also adjusted for the loss on sale of our Russia business, which included a non-cash charge for the release of our cumulative translation adjustment balance upon sale of the foreign entity. As noted previously, our net sales grew 22% in 2017 and in particular, our North America net sales grew 30%. This level of growth required significant working capital investments as we experienced higher demand for inventory positions with key clients and, at the same time, our accounts receivable balances began to age as collection efforts did not keep up with the growth. The 2017 results also reflect the collection of a single significant receivable from a client in the fourth quarter of 2016 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $160 million was due and paid in January 2017, as noted previously. Further impacting our operating cash flows was the fact that we report cash flows associated with trade payables financed under our inventory financing facility in the financing section of our statement of cash flows. In 2017, and most notably in the fourth quarter, we expanded the use of that facility with certain vendors. Had we not leveraged the facility during 2017, the net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $141.0 million that are reflected as cash flows provided by financing activities would have been included within trade payables, which are reflected in the operating activities section of our statement of cash flows. The increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2017 to support specific client engagements. The decrease in deferred revenue was a result of revenue recognition in 2017 on a number of larger client transactions in North America for which monies had been collected from clients prior to December 31, 2016, in advance of meeting the criteria for revenue recognition.\nWe anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with the funds available under our financing facilities, will be adequate to support our cash and working capital requirements for operations as well as other strategic investments over the next 12 months. We expect existing cash and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating cash activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as capital expenditures, repurchases of our common stock and debt repayments, for at least the next 12 months.\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nWe review property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment, our asset impairment review assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or the asset group plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset or the asset group (if any) and compares that value to the carrying value. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount. This approach uses our estimates of future market growth, forecasted net sales and costs, expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n Cash and Cash Flow\nDuring 2017, we used $305.4 million in operating activities, including approximately $186.9 million, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, utilized to fund the acquisitions of Datalink and Caase.com. We ended the year with $105.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $307.9 million of debt outstanding under our long-term debt facilities.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the goodwill impairment test is not required. In completing a quantitative test for a potential impairment of goodwill, we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value, including goodwill. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit, including the market and income approaches. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment, or both. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the Company, future market growth, forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. To ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units, we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n Net sales in North America increased 30%, or $1.2 billion, in 2017 compared to 2016, including 17% year over year growth in our core business driven by higher volume of sales from new and existing clients, and the addition of Datalink, which reported $524.3 million in net sales in 2017. Net sales of hardware, software and services increased 37%, 14% and 40%, respectively, year over year. The improvement in net sales in the hardware category reflects higher volume of sales to large enterprise clients and was due primarily to strong growth in data center solutions as well as client devices. Strong growth in our core business was complemented by the addition of Datalink, which accounted for approximately 29% of the year over year growth in the hardware category. The increase in the software category was also affected by the acquisition of Datalink, which accounted for approximately 70% of the year over year increase. The increase in services net sales reflects the addition of Datalink to our business, offset partially by declines in technical services projects in our core business in 2017 compared to 2016. Services net sales during 2017 also reflected the continued trend toward higher sales of cloud-based offerings and a higher mix of software maintenance sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Our net sales by offering category for North America for 2017 and 2016 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n (b) Calculated as average inventories (excluding inventories not available for sale) divided by daily costs of goods sold. Average inventories is calculated as the sum of the balances of inventories at the beginning of the period plus inventories at the end of the period divided by two. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days. \nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nRevenue is recognized from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license, but in no case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met (i.e., evidence of the arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable).\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n III. Estimated interest payments of $5.7 million in 2018, $5.2 million in 2019, $4.5 million in 2020 and $2.0 million in the first six months of 2021, based on the current debt balance at December 31, 2017 of $166.3 million under our TLA, multiplied by the floating interest rate applicable at December 31, 2017 of 3.57% per annum. \n (d) As a result of approved severance and restructuring plans, we expect future cash expenditures related to employee termination benefits. See further discussion in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \n\nAcquisition-related Expenses. During 2016, we incurred $169,000 in direct third-party transaction costs related to the acquisition of Ignia and $4.3 million in such costs related to the acquisition of Datalink that was completed on January 6, 2017. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of acquisitions.\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses increased 6%, or $1.2 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased approximately 90 basis points to 13.5% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 7% compared to the prior year. The year over year increase is primarily driven by higher variable compensation as a result of the increase in gross profit year over year and increased selling and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of Ignia, a business technology consulting and managed services provider, effective September 1, 2016.\nWe consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nFinancing Facilities\nDetails about segment results of operations can be found in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n (a) Calculated as the balance of accounts receivable, net at the end of the period divided by daily net sales. Daily net sales is calculated as net sales for the quarter divided by 92 days. \nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nIn December 2017, U.S. federal tax reform was enacted as part of the Tax Act. The change in tax law required a remeasurement of our deferred tax balances. In addition, the change in tax law included provisions requiring mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. Due to the enactment date and complexities of the new law, we have not completed our accounting related to these items. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, issued on December 22, 2017, we have concluded that the U.S. income taxes attributable to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred income taxes, the mandatory deemed repatriation provision and the state tax effects of these items are provisional amounts.\nAcquisitions\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n North America's selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, or $4.7 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, but decreased approximately 30 basis points year to year as a percentage of net sales to 10.1% of net sales in 2016. Teammate benefits expense, including healthcare expenses, increased $6.0 million year over year due to an increase in healthcare claims, and variable compensation increased $4.6 million as a result of the increase in net sales and gross profit year over year. These increases in expenses during 2016 compared to 2015 were partially offset by a decline in the provision for losses on accounts receivable of $3.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to favorable collection results and a decrease in salaries and wages and contract labor of $2.7 million resulting from cost reduction initiatives implemented earlier in 2016 across our North America business. Our results for 2015 included a non-cash charge of $800,000 to reduce the carrying amount of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nThroughout the \u201cOverview\u201d and \u201cResults of Operations\u201d sections of \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d we refer to changes in net sales, gross profit, selling and administrative expenses and earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and in North America, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In computing these amounts and percentages, we compare the current period amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior period amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted average translation rate for the current period.\nSelling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nEMEA's gross profit remained flat in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit was up 7% in 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 30 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the positive effect on gross margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis within the net sales line item. Changes in the mix and size of transactions and an increase in partner funding earlier in 2016 also contributed to the margin improvement during 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, we recognized an increase in margin resulting from higher fees from enterprise software agreements during 2016 compared to 2015.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2017, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $4.0 million, $4.9 million and $104,000, respectively. The North America charges related to severance actions taken to realign roles and responsibilities subsequent to the acquisition of Datalink in January 2017, as well as a headcount reduction as part of cost reduction initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2017. The EMEA charges primarily related to headcount reductions in France, Germany and the Netherlands as part our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives in EMEA. The APAC charges primarily related to severance actions taken subsequent to the acquisition of Ignia. Current period charges were offset by adjustments for changes in estimates of previous accruals as cash payments were made during 2017. During 2016, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $3.0 million, $1.5 million and $118,000, respectively. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\nThe table above excludes $4.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including $287,000 related to accrued interest, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See further discussion in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2016, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $3.0 million, $1.5 million and $118,000, respectively. The North America charges related to a headcount reduction as part of cost reduction initiatives early in 2016 noted previously, while the EMEA charges related to significant restructuring activities, primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany and France, as we worked to reduce our selling and administrative expenses in EMEA. Current period charges were offset by adjustments for changes in estimates of previous accruals as cash payments were made during 2016. During 2015, North America and EMEA recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $1.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively. APAC did not record any severance expense in 2015. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\n V. We estimate that we will owe $7.5 million in future years in connection with the obligations to perform asset-retirement activities that are conditional on a future event. \nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n \u2022 We continued our focus on tight expense control across the business. \n Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 24%, or $175.5 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, with gross margin increasing approximately 20 basis points to 13.7% of net sales. Our gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n \u2022 a gain of $338,000 on the sale of our Bloomingdale, Illinois real estate; and \n\nOur consolidated debt balance that can be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter under our revolving facility, our TLA and our ABS facility is limited by certain financial covenants, particularly a maximum leverage ratio. The maximum leverage ratio is calculated as aggregate debt outstanding divided by the sum of the Company's trailing twelve month net earnings (loss) plus (i) interest expense, excluding non-cash imputed interest on our inventory financing facility, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation, (v) extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash losses or expenses and (vi) certain cash restructuring and acquisition-related charges and synergies, not to exceed a specified cap (\u201cadjusted earnings\u201d). The maximum leverage ratio permitted under the facilities was increased to 3.50 times trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings in connection with the acquisition of Datalink in January 2017. We anticipate that we will be in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio requirements, which will decrease to 3.25 in 2018, over the next four quarters. However, a significant drop in the Company's adjusted earnings would limit the amount of indebtedness that could be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter to a level that would be below the Company's consolidated maximum facility amounts. Based on the maximum permitted leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017, the Company's debt balance that could have been outstanding under our revolving facility, TLA and ABS facility was the full amount of the maximum borrowing capacity of $766.3 million.\nThe information contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report concerning a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including our expected dates of adoption and the estimated effects on our results of operations and financial condition, is incorporated by reference herein.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our long-term debt balance includes $25.0 million outstanding under our $250.0 million ABS facility and $117.5 million outstanding under our $350.0 million revolving facility. In connection with the acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017, we amended our revolving facility to expand the facility by $175.0 million in the form of a TLA that requires amortization payments in years one through five. As of December 31, 2017, we had $166.3 million outstanding under our TLA. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a description of our amendment to our revolving facility in connection with our acquisition of Datalink.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ from our estimates. Members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $138.1 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 10 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2017 compared to 2016.\n2016 Compared to 2015\n \u2022 We generated double digit gross profit growth; and \nAt December 31, 2017, our contractual obligations for continuing operations were as follows (in thousands):\n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $4.9 million, $4.3 million net of tax; \nAs previously noted, the sales mix among our hardware, software and services categories for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 have been reclassified to conform to changes made to the current year presentation, as reflected in the following results of operations discussion for these periods. These changes in classification had no effect on previously reported total net sales, total costs of goods sold or gross profit amounts.\nThe results of operations for 2015 include the following items:\nOur consolidated cash flow operating metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n In EMEA, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $48,586,000 that were previously reported as part of our software product category in 2016 were reclassified to services to conform to the current year presentation.\nNotes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report also include: a description of our financing facilities; amounts outstanding; amounts available and weighted average borrowings and interest rates during the year.\nWe also have an agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable - inventory financing facility in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a \u201ccomponent\u201d). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management of the segment regularly reviews the operating results of that component. When two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, the components may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. Insight has three reporting units, which are equivalent to our operating segments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nIncome Taxes\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2016 and 2015 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on such balances and to higher average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances during 2016.\nWe perform an annual review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, and that assessment requires a significant amount of judgment. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations. Any adverse change in these factors, among others, could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n (1) Our consolidated statements of operations data includes results of the following acquisitions from their respective dates of acquisition: Caase.com from September 26, 2017, Datalink from January 6, 2017, Ignia from September 1, 2016 and BlueMetal from October 1, 2015. \n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider past operating results, future market growth, forecasted earnings, historical and projected taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance. If we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized, then all or part of the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.\nContractual Obligations\nOur strategy includes the possible acquisition of or investments in other businesses to expand or complement our operations or to add certain services capabilities. The magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of suitable candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions. Financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash, incurrence of additional debt, issuance of stock or some combination of the three. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our acquisitions of Caase.com on September 26, 2017 and Datalink on January 6, 2017 and the amendment to our revolving facility to fund, in part, the acquisition of Datalink.\n \u2022 In APAC: \nWe leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our partners and suppliers to deliver products to our clients without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. We recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis when the product is received by the client. We recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we control the transaction as the primary obligor for product fulfillment in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the client, we set the price of the product charged to the client, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our clients to determine their hardware and software specifications.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 19% in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher borrowing rates and higher average daily balances under our debt facilities in 2016 compared to 2015, while imputed interest under our inventory financing facility remained flat from 2015 to 2016 at $3.4 million. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the current portion of our long-term debt relates to our capital leases and other financing obligations as well as the amortization payments due in 2018 under our TLA. Our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\n In North America, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $270,000 and $87,984,000 that were previously reported as part of our hardware and software product categories, respectively, in 2016, were reclassified to services to conform to the current year presentation.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n \u2022 We sold our non-strategic business in Russia; \n In APAC, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $9,000 and $10,991,000 that were previously reported as part of our hardware and software product categories, respectively, in 2016, were reclassified to services to conform to the current year presentation.\n North America's gross profit in 2016 increased 5% compared to 2015, and as a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 10 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increases in supplier discounts year over year as we took advantage of early pay discounts offered by certain of our partners, which generated a 6 basis point improvement in margin year over year. During 2016, we also recognized a $2.2 million insurance settlement as a reduction of cost of sales due to the nature of the related insured loss previously recorded. The insurance settlement accounted for 6 basis points of the year over year margin expansion during 2016 compared to 2015. Although an increase in higher margin consulting services sales generated a 15 basis point improvement in gross margin year over year, the increase was partially offset by a decline in margin generated by sales of warranty services of 12 basis points year to year.\nPartner Funding\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n During the year ended December 31, 2017, our consolidated net sales from the provision of services was approximately 10% of net sales. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we began reporting, on the face of our consolidated statement of operations, net sales from the provision of services and the related costs of goods sold separately from net sales of products and the related costs of goods. For comparability purposes, the presentation of net sales and costs of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. These changes in presentation had no effect on previously reported total net sales, total costs of goods sold or gross profit amounts.\n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $4.6 million, $3.3 million net of tax; \n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n \u2022 We invested significantly to support cloud and services sales in Australia, which we expect will improve our growth trends in 2018. \nNet sales in EMEA increased 1%, or $16.9 million, in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. Net sales of hardware and services were up 11% and 15%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of software declined 7% year to year. The increase in hardware net sales was due primarily to higher volume sales of client devices, storage and networking solutions to public sector clients. The increase in services net sales was due primarily to increased sales of license consulting services and partner delivered services to new and existing clients across the region. In addition, a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction, are included in the services category. The decrease in software net sales was driven by a single significant transaction during the prior year period affecting the year over year comparison. Our net sales by offering category for EMEA for 2017 and 2016 (as reclassified), were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nNet of tax amounts referenced above were computed using the statutory tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expenses were recorded, adjusted for the effects of valuation allowances on net operating losses in certain jurisdictions.\n \u2022 the results of the acquisitions of Caase.com and Datalink, from their respective acquisition dates; \n \u2022 In North America: \nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 4%, or $26.8 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, with gross margin increasing approximately 20 basis points to 13.5% of net sales. Our gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities and was relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nItem 7 of this report. The selected consolidated financial data presented below under the captions \u201cConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\u201d and \u201cConsolidated Balance Sheet Data\u201d as of and for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2017 is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, which have been audited by KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, are included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n \u2022 an impairment loss of $800,000 to further reduce the carrying amount of our previously owned real estate in Bloomingdale, Illinois to its estimated fair value less costs to sell; and \nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses decreased 3%, or $5.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased approximately 10 basis points to 12.0% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% compared to the prior year. The increase in expenses (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was primarily driven by increased salaries and wages and teammate benefits expenses attributed to higher average cost per head in conjunction with our investments in sales and services related headcount to support services and cloud growth across the region.\nWe receive payments and credits from partners, including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs, volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs. Partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold. Partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the related inventory is sold. Partner funding received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as it is earned as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs. Consideration that exceeds the specific, incremental, identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold. Changes in estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs could have a material effect on our results of operations and our cash flows.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nIn certain arrangements, we may provide a combination of hardware and software products as well as services. Services that are performed by us in conjunction with hardware and software sales that are completed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product are recognized upon delivery, when title passes to the client, for the hardware sale. Net sales of services that are performed at client locations are primarily service-only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed. The total consideration for an arrangement with multiple deliverables is allocated to all deliverables that represent a separate unit of accounting using the relative selling price method.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n (a) Reflects the $25.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2017 under our ABS facility as due in June 2019, the date at which the facility matures, $117.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2017 under our revolving facility as due in June 2021, the date at which the facility matures, and $166.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2017 under our TLA. The TLA requires amortization payments of 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5% and 15% of the original principal balance in years one through five, respectively, to be paid quarterly through March 31, 2021, with the remaining balance of $107.2 million due at maturity on June 23, 2021. See further discussion in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \nSee further information on the carrying value of goodwill in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nContingencies\n II. Estimated interest payments of $4.1 million in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and $2.1 million in the first six months of 2021, based on the current debt balance at December 31, 2017 of $117.5 million under our revolving facility, multiplied by the floating interest rate applicable at December 31, 2017 of 3.49% per annum. \n \u2022 We acquired Caase.com in the third quarter, which further enhances our technical capabilities around Office 365 and Azure in the region. \nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n In APAC, fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $9,000 and $10,991,000 that were previously reported as part of our hardware and software product categories, respectively, in 2016, and fees earned from activities reported on a net basis of $6,000 and $8,439,000 that were previously reported as part of our hardware and software product categories, respectively, in 2015, were reclassified to services to conform to the current year presentation.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNet Sales. Net sales increased 22%, or $1.2 billion, in 2017 compared to 2016. Net sales of products (hardware and software) increased 21% and net sales of services increased 36% in 2017 compared to 2016 (as reclassified). Our net sales by operating segment for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nIn 2015, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflected increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. However, the 2015 results were also affected by the single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2015 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was due and paid in January 2016, as noted previously. The increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2015, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. As a result, cash flows from operating activities in 2015 exceeded our historical average annual cash flow generation of $80 million to $120 million.\nWe have historically not been adversely affected by inflation, as technological advances and competition within the IT industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short. This requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales. We believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients, as prices charged by us are not set by long-term contracts; however, as a result of competitive pressure, there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients.", "item_7_tables": "Table 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
