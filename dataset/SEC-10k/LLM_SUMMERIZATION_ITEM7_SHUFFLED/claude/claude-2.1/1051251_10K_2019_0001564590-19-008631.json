Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years 2018 and 2016 ended on February 2, 2019 and January 28, 2017, respectively, and consisted of 52 weeks each. Fiscal year 2017 ended on February 3, 2018 and consisted of 53 weeks. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExecutive Overview\nJ.Crew is an internationally recognized multi-brand apparel and accessories retailer that differentiates itself through high standards of quality, style, design and fabrics. We are a vertically-integrated, omni-channel specialty retailer that operates stores and websites both domestically and internationally. We generate approximately half of our net sales through our e-commerce business. We design our products, including those under the J.Crew\u00ae and Madewell\u00ae brands, to offer complete assortments of women's, men's and children's apparel and accessories.\nA summary of our revenues by brand is as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017(a)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n(As adjusted)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n(As adjusted)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> J.Crew\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,779.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,848.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,018.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Madewell\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 529.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 419.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 341.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,484.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,373.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,431.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Consists of 53 weeks.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance.

A key measure used in evaluating our business is comparable company sales. We also consider gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses in assessing the performance of our business.\nNet Sales\nNet sales reflect our revenues from the sale of our merchandise less returns and discounts. We aggregate our merchandise into four sales categories: (i) women's apparel, (ii) men's apparel, (iii) children's apparel, and (iv) accessories, which include shoes, socks, jewelry, handbags, belts and hair accessories. The approximate percentage of our sales by these four categories is as follows:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apparel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Women's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Men's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Children's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accessories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparable Company Sales\nComparable company sales reflect: (i) net sales at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, (ii) e-commerce net sales, and (iii) shipping and handling fees, which are recorded as other revenues on our statements of operations. Comparable company sales exclude net sales from: (i) new stores that have not been open for 12 months, (ii) the 53rd week, if applicable, (iii) stores that experience a square footage change of at least 15 percent, (iv) stores that have been temporarily closed for at least 30 consecutive days, (v) permanently closed stores, (vi) temporary pop up\u201d stores and (vii) revenue from wholesale customers. Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, when calculating comparable company sales for fiscal 2018, we have realigned the weeks of last year to be consistent with the current year retail calendar.\nMeasuring the change in year-over-year comparable company sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our business. Various factors affect comparable company sales, including:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> consumer preferences, fashion trends, buying trends and overall economic trends,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> competition,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in our merchandise mix,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> pricing,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the level of customer service that we provide,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to source and distribute products efficiently, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number of stores we open, close (including on a temporary basis for renovations) and expand in any period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCyclicality and Seasonality\nOur industry is cyclical and our revenues are affected by general economic conditions. Purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer confidence.\nOur business is seasonal and as a result, our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have four distinct selling seasons that align with our four fiscal quarters. Revenues are usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter, particularly in December when customers make holiday purchases. In fiscal 2018, we realized approximately 30% of our revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is determined by subtracting our cost of goods sold from our revenues. Cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, freight, design, buying and production costs, occupancy costs related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and all shipping costs associated with our e-commerce business. Cost of goods sold varies directly with revenues, and therefore, is usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter. Cost of goods sold also changes as we expand or contract our store base, which results in higher or lower store occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our revenues.\nOur gross profit may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold while others, like us, exclude all or a portion of them from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAt the end of fiscal 2018, we owned substantial excess merchandise inventories. As a result, we recorded a charge of $39.3 million for expected losses on the disposition of those inventories.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include all operating expenses not included in cost of goods sold, primarily administrative payroll, store expenses other than occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, certain warehousing expenses and credit card fees. These expenses do not necessarily vary proportionally with net sales.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenues as well as selected store data:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n2017(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n2016(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (As adjusted)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (As adjusted)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold, including buying and occupancy costs(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selected company data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n2017(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n2016(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> J.Crew:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (As adjusted)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (As adjusted)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of stores open at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in J.Crew comparable sales(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Madewell:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of stores open at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in Madewell comparable sales(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance.

Revenues generated in the 53rd week last year were $28.6 million. Comparable company sales increased 6.0% following a decrease of 6.1% last year.\nJ.Crew sales decreased $68.5 million, or 3.7%, to $1,779.5 million from $1,848.0 million last year.

The decrease in gross margin was driven by: (i) a 490 basis point deterioration in merchandise margin primarily due to higher shipping and handling driven by e-commerce growth, a higher level of promotional activity and increased penetration of our wholesale business, offset by (ii) a 70 basis point decrease in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues.\nAt the end of fiscal 2018, we owned substantial excess merchandise inventories. As a result, we recorded a charge of $39.3 million for expected losses on the disposition of those inventories.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $48.7 million, or 5.6%, to $824.0 million in fiscal 2018 from $872.7 million last year.

Among its many provisions, the Tax Reform reduced the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the new rate, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the rate we expect to be in effect when the deferred taxes will reverse.\nThe benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2017 was $103.6 million, which included (i) a deferred tax benefit of $50.6 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name, which was written down by $129.8 million in fiscal 2017 and (ii) the remeasurement of deferred taxes of $18.5 million pursuant to Tax Reform.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 46%. Items driving differences between the blended U.S. federal statutory rates of 33.7% and the effective rate include (i) the change in tax rates from Tax Reform, (ii) state and local income taxes, (iii) lower rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and (iv) changes in our valuation allowances, including the reversal of the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes at the federal level, offset by increases in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nAlthough Tax Reform significantly reduced the federal tax rate, it substantially reduced our ability to deduct interest expense beginning in fiscal 2018. The inability to use our interest deductions either in a current year, or carried forward to future years, has increased our projections of future taxable income.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 22%. Items driving differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate include (i) the recognition of certain valuation allowances, (ii) lower rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, (iii) reserves for uncertain tax positions and (iv) state and local income taxes.\nNet Loss\nNet loss increased $99.5 million to $123.2 million in fiscal 2017 from $23.7 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was due to: (i) higher impairment losses of $133.4 million, (ii) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $48.4 million and (iii) an increase in interest expense of $31.1 million, offset by (iv) an increase in the benefit for income taxes of $96.8 million, (v) an increase in gross profit of $16.3 million and (vi) a decrease in loss on refinancing of $0.4 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under the ABL Facility. Our primary cash needs are (i) meeting debt service requirements, (ii) capital expenditures in connection with making information technology enhancements, opening new stores and improving our existing stores and making investments in our distribution network and (iii) funding working capital requirements. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts payable and other current liabilities.

We cannot borrow in excess of $375 million under the ABL Facility without the consent of holders of at least a majority of the loans outstanding under our Term Loan Facility. The borrowing base under the ABL Facility equals the sum of: 90% of the eligible credit card receivables; plus, 85% of eligible accounts; plus, 90% (or 92.5% for the period of August 1 through December 31 of any fiscal year) of the net recovery percentage of eligible inventory multiplied by the cost of eligible inventory; plus 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible letters of credit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible letter of credit inventory; plus, 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible in-transit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible in-transit inventory; plus, 100% of qualified cash; minus, all availability and inventory reserves. The ABL Facility includes borrowing capacity in the form of letters of credit up to $200 million, and up to $25 million in U.S. dollars for loans on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, and is available in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. Any amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are due and payable in full on the maturity date of November 17, 2021.\nOn September 19, 2018, we entered into a Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement (Incremental Amendment) (the Sixth Amendment\u201d), which amended the ABL Facility to increase the revolving credit commitment from $350 million to $375 million, with the additional $25 million provided by MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which joined the ABL Facility as an additional lender.\nOn February 2, 2019, standby letters of credit were $64.7 million, outstanding borrowings were $70.8 million, and excess availability, as defined, was $233.7 million. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility was 5.05% on February 2, 2019. Average short-term borrowings under the ABL Facility were $70.3 million and $9.1 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.\nSee note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the terms of the ABL Facility.\nAs of the date of this report, there were outstanding borrowings of approximately $214 million under the ABL Facility, with excess availability of approximately $97 million.\nDemand Letter of Credit Facility\nWe have an unsecured demand letter of credit facility with HSBC which provides for the issuance of up to $20 million of documentary letters of credit on a no fee basis. On February 2, 2019, outstanding documentary letters of credit were $6.4 million and availability under this facility was $13.6 million.\nTerm Loan Facility\n2017Amendment. On July 13, 2017, concurrently with the settlement of the Exchange Offer, we amended our Term Loan Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the interest rate applicable to the loans held by consenting lenders, which represented 88% of lenders, (the Consenting Lenders\u201d; and the loans held by the Consenting Lenders, the Amended Loans\u201d) by 22 basis points, (ii) increase the amount of amortization payable to Consenting Lenders, (iii) provide for the New Term Loan Borrowings of $30.0 million, (iv) amend certain covenants and events of default and (v) direct Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent under the Term Loan Facility, to dismiss, with prejudice, certain litigation regarding the Initial Transferred IP (and the related actions). Additionally, we repaid $150.5 million of principal amount of term loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, which was financed with (i) the net proceeds from the New Money Notes of $94.1 million, (ii) the net proceeds from the New Term Loan Borrowings of $29.4 million and (iii) cash on hand of $27.0 million.\nInterest Rate. Initial borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin (which, in the case of the Amended Loans, was increased by 22 basis points) plus, at our option, either (a) a LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the relevant interest period adjusted for certain additional costs (subject to a floor) or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (3) a LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00%. New Term Loan Borrowings bear interest at 9% per annum payable in cash plus 3% per annum payable in kind.\nThe weighted average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility was 6.18% on February 2, 2019. The applicable margin (i) in effect for base rate borrowings was, (x) in the case of term loans, other than the New Term Loan Borrowings and the Amended Loans, 2.00%, (y) in the case of the Amended Loans, 2.22% and (z) in the case of the New Term Loan Borrowings, 12.00% (of which 3.00% is payable in kind) and (ii) with respect to LIBOR borrowings was, (x) in the case of term loans, other than the New Term Loan Borrowings and the Amended Loans, 3.00% and the LIBOR Floor, (y) in the case of the Amended Loans, 3.22% and the LIBOR Floor and (z) in the case of the New Term Loan Borrowings, 12.00% (of which 3.00% is payable in kind), respectively, at February 2, 2019.\nPrincipal Repayments. We are required to make principal repayments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility (excluding the New Term Loan Borrowings), or $3.9 million, on the last business day of January, April, July, and October. We are also required (i) to repay the term loan based on an annual calculation of excess cash flow, as defined in the agreement, (ii) in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, to make a principal repayment of $11.9 million which is equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of Amended Loans outstanding on July 13, 2017 and (iii) beginning on July 31, 2019, on the last business day of January, April, July and October, to make additional principal repayments of $1.5 million equal to 0.125% of the aggregate principal amount of Amended Loans outstanding on July 13, 2017. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is March 5, 2021.\nNotes\nGeneral. On July 13, 2017, in connection with settlement of the Exchange Offer and the issuance of the Notes, J.Crew Brand, LLC and J.Crew Brand Corp. (together, the Notes Co-Issuers\u201d) and the Guarantors (as defined below) entered into (i) an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee and collateral agent, governing the terms of the Exchange Notes (the Exchange Notes Indenture\u201d) and (ii) an indenture with the Trustee and U.S. Bank, as collateral agent, governing the terms of the New Money Notes (the New Money Notes Indenture\u201d), which is in substantially the same form as the Exchange Notes Indenture.\nInterest Rate. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 13% per annum, and interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes mature on September 15, 2021.\nNotes Guarantee. The Notes are guaranteed by J.Crew Brand Intermediate, LLC, IPCo and J.Crew International Brand, LLC, each of which is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the Guarantors,\u201d and each, a Guarantor\u201d). The PIK Notes Issuer also unconditionally guarantees the payment obligations of the Notes Co-Issuers and the Guarantors.\nExchange Notes Collateral. The Exchange Notes and the guarantees thereof are general senior secured obligations of the Notes Co-Issuers and the Guarantors, secured on a first priority lien basis by the Initial Transferred IP and certain other assets of the Notes Co-Issuers and Guarantors, and on a second priority lien basis by the Additional Transferred IP, subject, in each case, to permitted liens under the Exchange Notes Indenture and that certain intercreditor agreement, entered into between the collateral agents on July 13, 2017.\nNew Money Notes Collateral. The New Money Notes and the guarantees thereof are general senior secured obligations of the Notes Co-Issuers and the Guarantors, secured on a first priority lien basis by the Additional Transferred IP and certain other assets, and on a second priority lien basis by the Initial Transferred IP, subject, in each case, to permitted liens under the New Money Notes Indenture and the intercreditor agreement.\nRedemption. The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Notes Co-Issuers, in whole or in part, at any time, at a price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a make whole\u201d premium. The Notes are not subject to any mandatory redemption obligation, and there is no sinking fund provided for the Notes.\nChange in Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in each of the indentures, as applicable), the Notes Co-Issuers will be required to offer to repay all of the Notes at 100% of the aggregate principal amount repaid plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase.\nCovenants. Each of the indentures contains covenants covering (i) the payment of principal and interest, (ii) maintenance of an office or agency for the payment of the Notes, (iii) reports to the applicable Trustee and holders of the Notes, (iv) stay, extension and usury laws, (v) payment of taxes, (vi) existence, (vii) maintenance of properties and (viii) maintenance of insurance. Each of the indentures relating to the Notes also includes covenants that (i) limit the ability to transfer the collateral and (ii) limit liens that may be imposed on the assets of the Guarantors, which covenants are, in each case, subject to certain exceptions set forth in each of the indentures.\nPIK Notes\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the PIK Notes Issuer, an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million of PIK Notes. As part of the refinancing in July 2017, $565.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes were exchanged for $249.6 million of Exchange Notes and shares of preferred and common stock of the Parent. As of February 2, 2019, there were $1.0 million in aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes outstanding. The PIK Notes are: (i) senior unsecured obligations of the PIK Notes Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the PIK Notes Issuers' subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the PIK Notes Issuers' subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements.\nIP License Agreements\nIn December 2016, J.Crew International, Inc. ( JCI\u201d) transferred an undivided 72.04% ownership interest in the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand to IPCo, and entered into a related intellectual property license agreement with IPCo. In July 2017, JCI transferred the remaining undivided 27.96% ownership interest in the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand to IPCo, which, together with the initial intellectual property contributed in December 2016, represent 100% of the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand, entered into a license agreement amending and restating the December 2016 license agreement with IPCo and entered into an additional intellectual property license agreement with IPCo (collectively, the IP License Agreements\u201d).\nUnder the IP License Agreements, J.Crew Operating Corp, ( OpCo\u201d), our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, pays a fixed license fee of $59 million per annum to IPCo, which owns the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand. The license fees are payable on March 1 and September 1 of each fiscal year. The terms of the 2017 IP License Agreements are no less favorable than could be obtained in an arm's length transaction with an unaffiliated third party. These royalty payments have no impact on our consolidated results of operations and are not subject to the covenants under our credit facilities or the PIK Notes.\nThe proceeds from the license fees to IPCo are used by IPCo and J.Crew Brand, LLC, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, J.Crew BrandCo\u201d), to meet debt service requirements on the Notes. Any license fees in excess of the debt service requirements are loaned back to OpCo on a subordinated basis. As of February 2, 2019, J.Crew BrandCo had total assets of $403.1 million, consisting of intangible assets of $250.2 million, receivable due from OpCo of $128.0 million, license fee receivable of $24.6 million and cash and cash equivalents of $0.3 million, and total liabilities of $358.1 million related to the Notes. For the year ended February 2, 2019, IPCo earned royalty revenue of $59.0 million. The Notes are guaranteed by the intangible assets of J.Crew BrandCo.\nBelow is consolidating balance sheet information reflecting the elimination of the accounts of J.Crew BrandCo from our

primarily from (i) debt service requirements, including required (a) quarterly principal repayments and (b) repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, if any, as defined, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) working capital. Management anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 will be approximately $65 to $75 million, including approximately $30 million for our corporate headquarters relocation, approximately $20 million for information technology enhancements, $20 million for new stores and store improvements, and the remainder for warehouse improvements and general corporate purposes. Management expects to pay interest of approximately $125 million in fiscal 2019 to fund debt service obligations. During fiscal 2019, we expect to open 10 Madewell stores and close approximately 20 stores.\nManagement believes that our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, projected cash flow from operations and amounts available under the ABL Facility will be adequate to fund our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Our ability to satisfy these obligations and to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our financing arrangements depends on our future operating performance, which in turn, may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in part I of this report.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate a portion of our international purchase of merchandise.

Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, the pronouncements require lessees to recognize right-of-use assets ( ROU asset\u201d) and right-of-use liabilities ( ROU liability\u201d) for leases with terms of more than one year. The ROU liability is measured as the present value of the lease obligations, which we estimate to be in the range of $590 million to $640 million at the adoption date. The ROU asset reflects the amount of the ROU liability less lease-related deferred credits, which we estimate to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million at the adoption date. We expect to adopt the pronouncements in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the effective date method whereby initial application occurs on the date of adoption with comparative periods unchanged. Additionally, we plan to utilize the package of practical expedients permitted by the transition guidance, which allows us to carry forward our identification of contracts that are or contain leases, historical lease classification and initial direct costs for existing leases.\nIn January 2017, a pronouncement was issued that simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by no longer requiring an entity to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Instead, impairment will be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We do not expect there to be a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2017, a pronouncement was issued that simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance and more closely aligns risk management activities and financial reporting. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We do not expect there to be a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, other than required changes to disclosures.\nIn February 2018, a pronouncement was issued that will permit entities to reclassify tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, as a result of Tax Reform, to retained earnings. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements and plan to adopt in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\nIn August 2018, a pronouncement was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent consolidated results of operations. For more information on our accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We recognize sales made in our stores at the point of sale, sales through our e-commerce business at an estimated date of receipt by a customer and sales to a wholesale customer at the time ownership is transferred. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling sales are classified as other revenues. We make estimates of future sales returns related to current period sales. Management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns. We record an asset in other current assets for the inventory expected to be returned and a liability in other current liabilities for the sales expected to be refunded. On the statement of operations and comprehensive loss, we present the change in the liability in total revenues and the change in the asset in cost of goods sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold and recognizing revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. We review our gift card liability on an ongoing basis and recognize income from unredeemed gift card liability on a ratable basis over the estimated period of redemption. We defer revenue and recognize a liability for rewards points issued in connection with our customer loyalty program for the rewards points expected to be redeemed for merchandise in the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInventory Valuation\nMerchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. We capitalize certain design, purchasing and warehousing costs in inventory. We evaluate all of our inventories to determine excess inventories based on estimated future sales. Excess inventories may be disposed of through our e-commerce business, factory stores and other liquidation methods. Based on historical results experienced through various methods of disposition, we write down the carrying value of inventories that are not expected to be sold at or above cost. Additionally, we reduce the cost of inventories based on an estimate of lost or stolen items each period.\nAt the end of fiscal 2018, we owned substantial excess merchandise inventories. As a result, we recorded a charge of $39.3 million for expected losses on the disposition of those inventories.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the J.Crew trade name and goodwill, are not subject to amortization. We assess the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangibles whenever there are indicators of impairment, or at least annually in the fourth quarter. If the recorded carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, we record a charge to write the intangible asset down to its fair value. Definite-lived intangibles, such as the Madewell trade name and favorable lease commitments, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life or remaining lease term.\nWe assess the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, which consists of our operating segments, J.Crew and Madewell, of which only Madewell has goodwill. In this assessment, we first compare the estimated enterprise fair value of the Madewell reporting unit to its recorded carrying value. We estimate the enterprise fair value based on a combination of an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow, a market approach, and a transaction approach. If the recorded carrying value of the Madewell reporting unit exceeds its estimated enterprise fair value in the first step, a second step is performed in which we allocate the enterprise fair value to the fair value of Madewell's net assets. The second step of the impairment testing process requires, among other things, estimates of fair values of substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. Any enterprise fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill for Madewell. If the recorded goodwill balance for Madewell exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write goodwill down to its fair value.\nFixed Asset Impairment\nWe are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected undiscounted future cash flows. The major components of our long-lived assets are store fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements. We test for impairment at the store level and the net book value is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected discounted future net cash flows is less than net book value.\nIn fiscal 2018, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $10.8 million related to certain long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes\nAn asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxes are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance.\nWe maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.\nWith respect to uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return, we recognize in our financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not\u201d threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness. As cash flow hedges, unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The interest rate swap agreements are highly correlated to the changes in interest rates to which we are exposed. Unrealized gains and losses on this instrument are designated as effective or ineffective. The effective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, while the ineffective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of interest expense. Realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Gross Profit\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/\n(decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (As adjusted)(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in merchandise margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (121.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in buying and occupancy costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (61.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Madewell has goodwill. In this assessment, we first compare the estimated enterprise fair value of the Madewell reporting unit to its recorded carrying value. We estimate the enterprise fair value based on a combination of an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow, a market approach, and a transaction approach. If the recorded carrying value of the Madewell reporting unit exceeds its estimated enterprise fair value in the first step, a second step is performed in which we allocate the enterprise fair value to the fair value of Madewell's net assets. The second step of the impairment testing process requires, among other things, estimates of fair values of substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. Any enterprise fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill for Madewell. If the recorded goodwill balance for Madewell exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write goodwill down to its fair value.\n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance.

We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements and plan to adopt in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\n \u2022 our ability to source and distribute products efficiently, and \nNet loss decreased $3.1 million to $120.1 million in fiscal 2018 from $123.2 million last year. This decrease was due to: (i) a decrease in impairment losses of $130.4 million and (ii) a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $48.7 million, offset by (iii) a decrease in the benefit for income taxes of $87.0 million, (iv) a decrease in gross profit of $61.9 million and (v) an increase in interest expense of $27.0 million.\nResults of Operations-Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016\nIn August 2017, a pronouncement was issued that simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance and more closely aligns risk management activities and financial reporting. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We do not expect there to be a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, other than required changes to disclosures.\n (a) We completed a debt exchange and refinancing in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

We are a vertically-integrated, omni-channel specialty retailer that operates stores and websites both domestically and internationally. We generate approximately half of our net sales through our e-commerce business. We design our products, including those under the J.Crew\u00ae and Madewell\u00ae brands, to offer complete assortments of women's, men's and children's apparel and accessories.\nNotes Guarantee. The Notes are guaranteed by J.Crew Brand Intermediate, LLC, IPCo and J.Crew International Brand, LLC, each of which is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the Guarantors,\u201d and each, a Guarantor\u201d). The PIK Notes Issuer also unconditionally guarantees the payment obligations of the Notes Co-Issuers and the Guarantors.\n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nInventory Valuation\nGross margin increased to 37.8% in fiscal 2017 from 36.2% in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross margin was driven by a 160 basis point expansion in merchandise margin due to favorable product costs.\nResults of Operations\nThe following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent consolidated results of operations. For more information on our accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness. As cash flow hedges, unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The interest rate swap agreements are highly correlated to the changes in interest rates to which we are exposed. Unrealized gains and losses on this instrument are designated as effective or ineffective. The effective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, while the ineffective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of interest expense. Realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.\nCapital expenditures are planned at approximately $65 to $75 million for fiscal 2019, including approximately $30 million for our corporate headquarters relocation, approximately $20 million for information technology enhancements, $20 million for new stores and store improvements, and the remainder for warehouse improvements and general corporate purposes.\nIn December 2017, significant changes were made to the federal tax law in the United States. Among its many provisions, the Tax Reform reduced the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the new rate, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the rate we expect to be in effect when the deferred taxes will reverse.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of February 2, 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 46%. Items driving differences between the blended U.S. federal statutory rates of 33.7% and the effective rate include (i) the change in tax rates from Tax Reform, (ii) state and local income taxes, (iii) lower rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and (iv) changes in our valuation allowances, including the reversal of the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes at the federal level, offset by increases in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nRevenues\n\n \u2022 Revenues increased 4.6% to $2,484.0 million, with comparable company sales up 6.0%. \nUnder the IP License Agreements, J.Crew Operating Corp, ( OpCo\u201d), our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, pays a fixed license fee of $59 million per annum to IPCo, which owns the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand. The license fees are payable on March 1 and September 1 of each fiscal year. The terms of the 2017 IP License Agreements are no less favorable than could be obtained in an arm's length transaction with an unaffiliated third party. These royalty payments have no impact on our consolidated results of operations and are not subject to the covenants under our credit facilities or the PIK Notes.\nRedemption. The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Notes Co-Issuers, in whole or in part, at any time, at a price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a make whole\u201d premium. The Notes are not subject to any mandatory redemption obligation, and there is no sinking fund provided for the Notes.\nAlthough Tax Reform significantly reduced the federal tax rate, it substantially reduced our ability to deduct interest expense beginning in fiscal 2018. The inability to use our interest deductions either in a current year, or carried forward to future years, has increased our projections of future taxable income.\nTerm Loan Facility\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nComparable company sales reflect: (i) net sales at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, (ii) e-commerce net sales, and (iii) shipping and handling fees, which are recorded as other revenues on our statements of operations. Comparable company sales exclude net sales from: (i) new stores that have not been open for 12 months, (ii) the 53rd week, if applicable, (iii) stores that experience a square footage change of at least 15 percent, (iv) stores that have been temporarily closed for at least 30 consecutive days, (v) permanently closed stores, (vi) temporary pop up\u201d stores and (vii) revenue from wholesale customers. Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, when calculating comparable company sales for fiscal 2018, we have realigned the weeks of last year to be consistent with the current year retail calendar.\nExecutive Overview\n o 15% of Parent's common equity, or 17,362,719 shares of Parent's class A common stock, $0.00001 par value per share; \nCyclicality and Seasonality\nIncome Taxes\n\nIP License Agreements\nInterest Rate. Initial borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin (which, in the case of the Amended Loans, was increased by 22 basis points) plus, at our option, either (a) a LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the relevant interest period adjusted for certain additional costs (subject to a floor) or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (3) a LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00%. New Term Loan Borrowings bear interest at 9% per annum payable in cash plus 3% per annum payable in kind.\nIn December 2016, J.Crew International, Inc. ( JCI\u201d) transferred an undivided 72.04% ownership interest in the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand to IPCo, and entered into a related intellectual property license agreement with IPCo. In July 2017, JCI transferred the remaining undivided 27.96% ownership interest in the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand to IPCo, which, together with the initial intellectual property contributed in December 2016, represent 100% of the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand, entered into a license agreement amending and restating the December 2016 license agreement with IPCo and entered into an additional intellectual property license agreement with IPCo (collectively, the IP License Agreements\u201d).\nABL Facility\n\nITEM 7.\n\nOur industry is cyclical and our revenues are affected by general economic conditions. Purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer confidence.\nWe are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected undiscounted future cash flows. The major components of our long-lived assets are store fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements. We test for impairment at the store level and the net book value is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected discounted future net cash flows is less than net book value.\nGeneral. On July 13, 2017, in connection with settlement of the Exchange Offer and the issuance of the Notes, J.Crew Brand, LLC and J.Crew Brand Corp. (together, the Notes Co-Issuers\u201d) and the Guarantors (as defined below) entered into (i) an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee and collateral agent, governing the terms of the Exchange Notes (the Exchange Notes Indenture\u201d) and (ii) an indenture with the Trustee and U.S. Bank, as collateral agent, governing the terms of the New Money Notes (the New Money Notes Indenture\u201d), which is in substantially the same form as the Exchange Notes Indenture.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 46%. Items driving differences between the blended U.S. federal statutory rates of 33.7% and the effective rate include (i) the change in tax rates from Tax Reform, (ii) state and local income taxes, (iii) lower rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and (iv) changes in our valuation allowances, including the reversal of the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes at the federal level, offset by increases in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nCash used in operating activities of $69.3 million in fiscal 2018 resulted from: (i) a net loss of $120.1 million and (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities of $49.4 million, primarily due to an increase in merchandise inventories as a result of an anticipated increase in revenues, partially offset by (iii) non-cash adjustments of $100.2 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a charge of $39.3 million for expected losses on the disposition of excess merchandise inventories.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the PIK Notes Issuer, an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million of PIK Notes. As part of the refinancing in July 2017, $565.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes were exchanged for $249.6 million of Exchange Notes and shares of preferred and common stock of the Parent. As of February 2, 2019, there were $1.0 million in aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes outstanding. The PIK Notes are: (i) senior unsecured obligations of the PIK Notes Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the PIK Notes Issuers' subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the PIK Notes Issuers' subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements.\nCash used in financing activities was $52.3 million in fiscal 2017 resulting from: (i) repayments pursuant to the Term Loan amendment, offset by (ii) the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes (as defined below).\nInterest expense, net of interest income, increased $27.0 million to $137.5 million in fiscal 2018 from $110.5 million last year. A summary of interest expense is as follows:\nThe benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2017 was $103.6 million, which included (i) a deferred tax benefit of $50.6 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name, which was written down by $129.8 million in fiscal 2017 and (ii) the remeasurement of deferred taxes of $18.5 million pursuant to Tax Reform.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 12%. Items driving differences between the U.S. federal statutory rates of 21% and the effective rate include (i) increase in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes, (ii) state and local income taxes and (iii) lower rates in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $48.7 million, or 5.6%, to $824.0 million in fiscal 2018 from $872.7 million last year. This decrease primarily resulted from the following:\nImpairment losses were $10.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $141.2 million last year. The impairment losses were the result of the write-down of the following assets:\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. A key measure used in evaluating our business is comparable company sales. We also consider gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses in assessing the performance of our business.\nNet sales reflect our revenues from the sale of our merchandise less returns and discounts. We aggregate our merchandise into four sales categories: (i) women's apparel, (ii) men's apparel, (iii) children's apparel, and (iv) accessories, which include shoes, socks, jewelry, handbags, belts and hair accessories. The approximate percentage of our sales by these four categories is as follows:\n \u2022 Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. \n\nAt the end of fiscal 2018, we owned substantial excess merchandise inventories. As a result, we recorded a charge of $39.3 million for expected losses on the disposition of those inventories.\nAs of February 2, 2019, we operated 203 J.Crew retail stores, 174 J.Crew factory stores (including 42 J.Crew Mercantile stores) and 129 Madewell stores throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong; compared to 235 J.Crew retail stores, 176 J.Crew factory stores (including 42 J.Crew Mercantile stores) and 121 Madewell stores as of February 3, 2018.\n\nA summary of our revenues by brand is as follows:\nNet Loss\nContractual Obligations\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from (i) debt service requirements, including required (a) quarterly principal repayments and (b) repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, if any, as defined, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) working capital. Management anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 will be approximately $65 to $75 million, including approximately $30 million for our corporate headquarters relocation, approximately $20 million for information technology enhancements, $20 million for new stores and store improvements, and the remainder for warehouse improvements and general corporate purposes. Management expects to pay interest of approximately $125 million in fiscal 2019 to fund debt service obligations. During fiscal 2019, we expect to open 10 Madewell stores and close approximately 20 stores.\nCash used in financing activities was $12.9 million in fiscal 2016 resulting from: (i) principal repayments of the Term Loan Facility and (ii) costs paid in connection with the refinancing of debt.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $48.4 million, or 5.9%, to $872.7 million in fiscal 2017 from $824.3 million in fiscal 2016. This increase primarily resulted from the following:\n (e) Amounts shown do not include interest. \nComparable Company Sales\n\nInterest Rate. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 13% per annum, and interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes mature on September 15, 2021.\nNet Loss\n o the repayment of $150.5 million principal amount of term loans then outstanding under the Term Loan Facility; \nDebt Exchange and Refinancing\n \u2022 the level of customer service that we provide, \n\nGross margin decreased to 33.6% in fiscal 2018 from 37.8% last year. The decrease in gross margin was driven by: (i) a 490 basis point deterioration in merchandise margin primarily due to higher shipping and handling driven by e-commerce growth, a higher level of promotional activity and increased penetration of our wholesale business, offset by (ii) a 70 basis point decrease in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAs a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 33.2% in fiscal 2018 from 36.8% last year.\n o the raising of additional borrowings under the Term Loan Facility of $30.0 million (at a 2% discount) provided by our Sponsors (the New Term Loan Borrowings\u201d), the net proceeds of which were also applied, in part, to finance the repayment of the $150.5 million principal amount of term loans referenced above. \n (c) Calculated on a 52-week basis. \nIn August 2018, a pronouncement was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nOther revenues increased $69.4 million, or 65.6%, to $175.3 million from $105.9 million last year, primarily as a result of revenue from wholesale customers.\n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nGross profit increased $16.3 million to $897.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $881.3 million in fiscal 2016. This increase resulted from the following factors:\n2017Amendment. On July 13, 2017, concurrently with the settlement of the Exchange Offer, we amended our Term Loan Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the interest rate applicable to the loans held by consenting lenders, which represented 88% of lenders, (the Consenting Lenders\u201d; and the loans held by the Consenting Lenders, the Amended Loans\u201d) by 22 basis points, (ii) increase the amount of amortization payable to Consenting Lenders, (iii) provide for the New Term Loan Borrowings of $30.0 million, (iv) amend certain covenants and events of default and (v) direct Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent under the Term Loan Facility, to dismiss, with prejudice, certain litigation regarding the Initial Transferred IP (and the related actions). Additionally, we repaid $150.5 million of principal amount of term loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, which was financed with (i) the net proceeds from the New Money Notes of $94.1 million, (ii) the net proceeds from the New Term Loan Borrowings of $29.4 million and (iii) cash on hand of $27.0 million.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\n (b) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n (a) Consists of 53 weeks. \nResults of Operations-Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017\n (a) Operating lease obligations represent obligations under various long-term operating leases entered in the normal course of business for retail and factory stores, office space and equipment requiring minimum annual rentals. Operating lease expense is a significant component of our operating expenses. The lease terms range for various periods of time in various rental markets and are entered into at different times, which mitigates exposure to market changes that could have a material effect on our results of operations within any given year. Operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and other occupancy costs, which aggregate to approximately 44% of the minimum lease obligations. \nNotes\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nIn February 2016 and July 2018, pronouncements were issued with respect to the accounting for leases. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, the pronouncements require lessees to recognize right-of-use assets ( ROU asset\u201d) and right-of-use liabilities ( ROU liability\u201d) for leases with terms of more than one year. The ROU liability is measured as the present value of the lease obligations, which we estimate to be in the range of $590 million to $640 million at the adoption date. The ROU asset reflects the amount of the ROU liability less lease-related deferred credits, which we estimate to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million at the adoption date. We expect to adopt the pronouncements in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the effective date method whereby initial application occurs on the date of adoption with comparative periods unchanged. Additionally, we plan to utilize the package of practical expedients permitted by the transition guidance, which allows us to carry forward our identification of contracts that are or contain leases, historical lease classification and initial direct costs for existing leases.\n (c) Relates primarily to commitments incurred in connection with our e-commerce platform. \n \u2022 We opened eight Madewell stores and one J.Crew retail store. We closed 33 J.Crew retail stores and two J.Crew factory stores. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 pricing, \nRevenues\n \u2022 certain amendments to the indenture governing the PIK Notes; \n (c) Consists primarily of revenues from wholesale customers and shipping and handling fees. \n\nInterest expense, net of interest income, increased $31.1 million to $110.5 million in fiscal 2017 from $79.4 million in fiscal 2016. A summary of interest expense is as follows:\n o $249,596,000 aggregate principal amount of 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 issued by J.Crew Brand, LLC and J.Crew Brand Corp. (the Exchange Notes\u201d), which are secured primarily by the U.S. intellectual property assets held by J.Crew Domestic Brand, LLC ( IPCo\u201d); \nWe have an ABL Facility, which is governed by a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents and lenders party thereto, that, following the Sixth Amendment described below, provides for a $375 million senior secured asset-based revolving line of credit (which may be increased by up to $75 million in certain circumstances), subject to a borrowing base limitation. We cannot borrow in excess of $375 million under the ABL Facility without the consent of holders of at least a majority of the loans outstanding under our Term Loan Facility. The borrowing base under the ABL Facility equals the sum of: 90% of the eligible credit card receivables; plus, 85% of eligible accounts; plus, 90% (or 92.5% for the period of August 1 through December 31 of any fiscal year) of the net recovery percentage of eligible inventory multiplied by the cost of eligible inventory; plus 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible letters of credit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible letter of credit inventory; plus, 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible in-transit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible in-transit inventory; plus, 100% of qualified cash; minus, all availability and inventory reserves. The ABL Facility includes borrowing capacity in the form of letters of credit up to $200 million, and up to $25 million in U.S. dollars for loans on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, and is available in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. Any amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are due and payable in full on the maturity date of November 17, 2021.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nAs of the date of this report, there were outstanding borrowings of approximately $214 million under the ABL Facility, with excess availability of approximately $97 million.\nTotal revenues increased $110.3 million, or 4.6%, to $2,484.0 million from $2,373.7 million last year, driven primarily by an increase in sales of women's apparel, specifically pants, sweaters and knits. Revenues generated in the 53rd week last year were $28.6 million. Comparable company sales increased 6.0% following a decrease of 6.1% last year.\n\n\n (b) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nGross Profit\nInterest Expense, Net\n\n \u2022 an amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2014 (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) to, among other things, facilitate the following related transactions: \nPrincipal Repayments. We are required to make principal repayments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility (excluding the New Term Loan Borrowings), or $3.9 million, on the last business day of January, April, July, and October. We are also required (i) to repay the term loan based on an annual calculation of excess cash flow, as defined in the agreement, (ii) in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, to make a principal repayment of $11.9 million which is equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of Amended Loans outstanding on July 13, 2017 and (iii) beginning on July 31, 2019, on the last business day of January, April, July and October, to make additional principal repayments of $1.5 million equal to 0.125% of the aggregate principal amount of Amended Loans outstanding on July 13, 2017. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is March 5, 2021.\n\nSee note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the terms of the ABL Facility.\n (b) As of February 2, 2019, we have recorded $25.3 million in liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, which are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. While these tax liabilities may result in future cash outflows, management cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the effective settlement of these positions. \nOur business is seasonal and as a result, our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have four distinct selling seasons that align with our four fiscal quarters. Revenues are usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter, particularly in December when customers make holiday purchases. In fiscal 2018, we realized approximately 30% of our revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nInvesting Activities\nThe weighted average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility was 6.18% on February 2, 2019. The applicable margin (i) in effect for base rate borrowings was, (x) in the case of term loans, other than the New Term Loan Borrowings and the Amended Loans, 2.00%, (y) in the case of the Amended Loans, 2.22% and (z) in the case of the New Term Loan Borrowings, 12.00% (of which 3.00% is payable in kind) and (ii) with respect to LIBOR borrowings was, (x) in the case of term loans, other than the New Term Loan Borrowings and the Amended Loans, 3.00% and the LIBOR Floor, (y) in the case of the Amended Loans, 3.22% and the LIBOR Floor and (z) in the case of the New Term Loan Borrowings, 12.00% (of which 3.00% is payable in kind), respectively, at February 2, 2019.\nOur gross profit may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold while others, like us, exclude all or a portion of them from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOperating Activities\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under the ABL Facility. Our primary cash needs are (i) meeting debt service requirements, (ii) capital expenditures in connection with making information technology enhancements, opening new stores and improving our existing stores and making investments in our distribution network and (iii) funding working capital requirements. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts payable and other current liabilities. See -Outlook\u201d below.\nBelow is consolidating statement of operations and comprehensive loss information reflecting the elimination of the accounts of J.Crew BrandCo from our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended February 2, 2019.\nChange in Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in each of the indentures, as applicable), the Notes Co-Issuers will be required to offer to repay all of the Notes at 100% of the aggregate principal amount repaid plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase.\n\nNet loss increased $99.5 million to $123.2 million in fiscal 2017 from $23.7 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was due to: (i) higher impairment losses of $133.4 million, (ii) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $48.4 million and (iii) an increase in interest expense of $31.1 million, offset by (iv) an increase in the benefit for income taxes of $96.8 million, (v) an increase in gross profit of $16.3 million and (vi) a decrease in loss on refinancing of $0.4 million.\nThe proceeds from the license fees to IPCo are used by IPCo and J.Crew Brand, LLC, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, J.Crew BrandCo\u201d), to meet debt service requirements on the Notes. Any license fees in excess of the debt service requirements are loaned back to OpCo on a subordinated basis. As of February 2, 2019, J.Crew BrandCo had total assets of $403.1 million, consisting of intangible assets of $250.2 million, receivable due from OpCo of $128.0 million, license fee receivable of $24.6 million and cash and cash equivalents of $0.3 million, and total liabilities of $358.1 million related to the Notes. For the year ended February 2, 2019, IPCo earned royalty revenue of $59.0 million. The Notes are guaranteed by the intangible assets of J.Crew BrandCo.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries completed the following interrelated liability management transactions:\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events, \n \u2022 a private exchange offer (the Exchange Offer\u201d) pursuant to which $565.7 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 7.75%/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2019 (the PIK Notes\u201d) issued by Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent (the PIK Notes Issuer\u201d), were exchanged for aggregate consideration consisting of: \nThe following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenues as well as selected store data:\n \u2022 We account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold and recognizing revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. We review our gift card liability on an ongoing basis and recognize income from unredeemed gift card liability on a ratable basis over the estimated period of redemption. We defer revenue and recognize a liability for rewards points issued in connection with our customer loyalty program for the rewards points expected to be redeemed for merchandise in the future. \nCovenants. Each of the indentures contains covenants covering (i) the payment of principal and interest, (ii) maintenance of an office or agency for the payment of the Notes, (iii) reports to the applicable Trustee and holders of the Notes, (iv) stay, extension and usury laws, (v) payment of taxes, (vi) existence, (vii) maintenance of properties and (viii) maintenance of insurance. Each of the indentures relating to the Notes also includes covenants that (i) limit the ability to transfer the collateral and (ii) limit liens that may be imposed on the assets of the Guarantors, which covenants are, in each case, subject to certain exceptions set forth in each of the indentures.\nCash provided by financing activities was $55.1 million in fiscal 2018 resulting primarily from: (i) net borrowings under the ABL Facility, offset by (ii) quarterly principal repayments of the Term Loan Facility.\n \u2022 We recognize sales made in our stores at the point of sale, sales through our e-commerce business at an estimated date of receipt by a customer and sales to a wholesale customer at the time ownership is transferred. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling sales are classified as other revenues. We make estimates of future sales returns related to current period sales. Management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns. We record an asset in other current assets for the inventory expected to be returned and a liability in other current liabilities for the sales expected to be refunded. On the statement of operations and comprehensive loss, we present the change in the liability in total revenues and the change in the asset in cost of goods sold. \n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nGross profit decreased $61.9 million to $835.7 million in fiscal 2018 from $897.6 million last year. This decrease resulted from the following factors:\nCash provided by operating activities of $62.9 million in fiscal 2017 resulted from: (i) non-cash adjustments of $147.9 million and (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities of $38.2 million due to working capital fluctuations, partially offset by (iii) net loss of $123.2 million.\nCash provided by operating activities of $137.8 million in fiscal 2016 resulted from: (i) non-cash adjustments of $138.1 million and (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities of $23.4 million due to working capital fluctuations, partially offset by (iii) net loss of $23.7 million.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 22%. Items driving differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate include (i) the recognition of certain valuation allowances, (ii) lower rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, (iii) reserves for uncertain tax positions and (iv) state and local income taxes.\n \u2022 the number of stores we open, close (including on a temporary basis for renovations) and expand in any period. \nInterest Expense, Net\nOn February 2, 2019, standby letters of credit were $64.7 million, outstanding borrowings were $70.8 million, and excess availability, as defined, was $233.7 million. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility was 5.05% on February 2, 2019. Average short-term borrowings under the ABL Facility were $70.3 million and $9.1 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.\nGross Profit\nAt the end of fiscal 2018, we owned substantial excess merchandise inventories. As a result, we recorded a charge of $39.3 million for expected losses on the disposition of those inventories.\nNew Money Notes Collateral. The New Money Notes and the guarantees thereof are general senior secured obligations of the Notes Co-Issuers and the Guarantors, secured on a first priority lien basis by the Additional Transferred IP and certain other assets, and on a second priority lien basis by the Initial Transferred IP, subject, in each case, to permitted liens under the New Money Notes Indenture and the intercreditor agreement.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include all operating expenses not included in cost of goods sold, primarily administrative payroll, store expenses other than occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, certain warehousing expenses and credit card fees. These expenses do not necessarily vary proportionally with net sales.\nImpairment Losses\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nFinancing Activities\nWe enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate a portion of our international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure reimbursement obligations under certain insurance and import programs and lease obligations. As of February 2, 2019, we had the following obligations under letters of credit in future periods.\nAn asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxes are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant.\nTotal revenues decreased $57.9 million, or 2.4%, to $2,373.7 million in fiscal 2017 from $2,431.6 million in fiscal 2016, driven primarily by a decrease in sales of men's apparel, specifically shirts, suiting and pants. Revenues generated in the 53rd week of fiscal 2017 were $28.6 million. Comparable company sales decreased 6.1% in fiscal 2017 following a decrease of 6.1% in fiscal 2016.\nImpact of Inflation\n o the transfer of the remaining undivided 27.96% ownership interest in the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand (the Additional Transferred IP\u201d) to IPCo, which, together with the undivided 72.04% ownership interest transferred in December 2016 (the Initial Transferred IP\u201d) represent 100% of the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand (the Transferred IP\u201d), and the execution of related license agreements; \n o 189,688 shares of Parent's 7% non-convertible perpetual series A preferred stock, no par value per share, with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $189,688,000 (which aggregate liquidation preference was $194,167,061 as of February 2, 2019); and \n</table>\nA summary of highlights for fiscal 2018 is as follows:\n (b) We exclude a portion of our distribution network costs from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses. Our gross profit therefore may not be directly comparable to that of some of our competitors. \n\nMadewell sales increased $78.3 million, or 22.9%, to $419.8 million in fiscal 2017 from $341.5 million in fiscal 2016. Madewell comparable sales increased 14.4% in fiscal 2017 following an increase of 6.5% in fiscal 2016.\n (b) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance.

Our ability to satisfy these obligations and to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our financing arrangements depends on our future operating performance, which in turn, may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in part I of this report.\nNet Sales\n (a) Consists of 53 weeks. \nThis discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during each of the years in a three-year period ended February 2, 2019. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years 2018 and 2016 ended on February 2, 2019 and January 28, 2017, respectively, and consisted of 52 weeks each. Fiscal year 2017 ended on February 3, 2018 and consisted of 53 weeks. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGross profit is determined by subtracting our cost of goods sold from our revenues. Cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, freight, design, buying and production costs, occupancy costs related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and all shipping costs associated with our e-commerce business. Cost of goods sold varies directly with revenues, and therefore, is usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter. Cost of goods sold also changes as we expand or contract our store base, which results in higher or lower store occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our revenues.\nMerchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. We capitalize certain design, purchasing and warehousing costs in inventory. We evaluate all of our inventories to determine excess inventories based on estimated future sales. Excess inventories may be disposed of through our e-commerce business, factory stores and other liquidation methods. Based on historical results experienced through various methods of disposition, we write down the carrying value of inventories that are not expected to be sold at or above cost. Additionally, we reduce the cost of inventories based on an estimate of lost or stolen items each period.\n o the issuance of $97.0 million aggregate principal amount of an additional series of 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 by J.Crew Brand, LLC and J.Crew Brand Corp. (the New Money Notes\u201d and, together with the Exchange Notes, the Notes\u201d), subject to the same terms and conditions as the Exchange Notes, for cash at a 3% discount, subject to the terms of the note purchase agreement, dated June 12, 2017, the proceeds of which were loaned on a subordinated basis to us and were applied, in part, to finance the repayment of the $150.5 million principal amount of term loans referenced above; and \nMeasuring the change in year-over-year comparable company sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our business. Various factors affect comparable company sales, including:\nJ.Crew sales decreased $170.5 million, or 8.4%, to $1,848.0 million in fiscal 2017 from $2,018.5 million in fiscal 2016. J.Crew comparable sales decreased 9.6% in fiscal 2017 following a decrease of 7.8% in fiscal 2016.\nImpairment Losses\nJ.Crew sales decreased $68.5 million, or 3.7%, to $1,779.5 million from $1,848.0 million last year. J.Crew comparable sales increased 1.5% following a decrease of 9.6% last year.\nFinancing Arrangements\nOther revenues increased $34.3 million, or 47.9%, to $105.9 million in fiscal 2017 from $71.6 million in fiscal 2016, primarily a result of revenue from wholesale customers.", "item_7_text": "Gross Profit\nWe maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.\n\n \u2022 J.Crew revenues decreased 3.7% to $1,779.5 million, with J.Crew comparable sales up 1.5%. \n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nDemand Letter of Credit Facility\nOutlook\nAt the end of fiscal 2018, we owned substantial excess merchandise inventories. As a result, we recorded a charge of $39.3 million for expected losses on the disposition of those inventories.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn January 2017, a pronouncement was issued that simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by no longer requiring an entity to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Instead, impairment will be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We do not expect there to be a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWith respect to uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return, we recognize in our financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not\u201d threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement.\n \u2022 consumer preferences, fashion trends, buying trends and overall economic trends, \nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nPIK Notes\nOn September 19, 2018, we entered into a Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement (Incremental Amendment) (the Sixth Amendment\u201d), which amended the ABL Facility to increase the revolving credit commitment from $350 million to $375 million, with the additional $25 million provided by MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which joined the ABL Facility as an additional lender.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the J.Crew trade name and goodwill, are not subject to amortization. We assess the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangibles whenever there are indicators of impairment, or at least annually in the fourth quarter. If the recorded carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, we record a charge to write the intangible asset down to its fair value. Definite-lived intangibles, such as the Madewell trade name and favorable lease commitments, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life or remaining lease term.\n \u2022 changes in our merchandise mix, \nBelow is consolidating balance sheet information reflecting the elimination of the accounts of J.Crew BrandCo from our consolidated balance sheet as of February 2, 2019.\nWe assess the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, which consists of our operating segments, J.Crew and Madewell, of which only Madewell has goodwill. In this assessment, we first compare the estimated enterprise fair value of the Madewell reporting unit to its recorded carrying value. We estimate the enterprise fair value based on a combination of an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow, a market approach, and a transaction approach. If the recorded carrying value of the Madewell reporting unit exceeds its estimated enterprise fair value in the first step, a second step is performed in which we allocate the enterprise fair value to the fair value of Madewell's net assets. The second step of the impairment testing process requires, among other things, estimates of fair values of substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. Any enterprise fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill for Madewell. If the recorded goodwill balance for Madewell exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write goodwill down to its fair value.\n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nRevenue Recognition\n (a) Consists of 53 weeks. \nImpairment losses were $141.2 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.8 million fiscal 2016. The impairment losses were the result of the write-down of the following assets:\n (d) Our Senior Credit Facilities are comprised of a $1,374 million Term Loan Facility and a $375 million ABL Facility, under which $70.8 million of borrowings were outstanding as of February 2, 2019.

The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements and plan to adopt in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\n \u2022 our ability to source and distribute products efficiently, and \nNet loss decreased $3.1 million to $120.1 million in fiscal 2018 from $123.2 million last year. This decrease was due to: (i) a decrease in impairment losses of $130.4 million and (ii) a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $48.7 million, offset by (iii) a decrease in the benefit for income taxes of $87.0 million, (iv) a decrease in gross profit of $61.9 million and (v) an increase in interest expense of $27.0 million.\nResults of Operations-Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016\nIn August 2017, a pronouncement was issued that simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance and more closely aligns risk management activities and financial reporting. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We do not expect there to be a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, other than required changes to disclosures.\n (a) We completed a debt exchange and refinancing in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

We are a vertically-integrated, omni-channel specialty retailer that operates stores and websites both domestically and internationally. We generate approximately half of our net sales through our e-commerce business. We design our products, including those under the J.Crew\u00ae and Madewell\u00ae brands, to offer complete assortments of women's, men's and children's apparel and accessories.\nNotes Guarantee. The Notes are guaranteed by J.Crew Brand Intermediate, LLC, IPCo and J.Crew International Brand, LLC, each of which is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the Guarantors,\u201d and each, a Guarantor\u201d). The PIK Notes Issuer also unconditionally guarantees the payment obligations of the Notes Co-Issuers and the Guarantors.\n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nInventory Valuation\nGross margin increased to 37.8% in fiscal 2017 from 36.2% in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross margin was driven by a 160 basis point expansion in merchandise margin due to favorable product costs.\nResults of Operations\nThe following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent consolidated results of operations. For more information on our accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness. As cash flow hedges, unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The interest rate swap agreements are highly correlated to the changes in interest rates to which we are exposed. Unrealized gains and losses on this instrument are designated as effective or ineffective. The effective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, while the ineffective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of interest expense. Realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.\nCapital expenditures are planned at approximately $65 to $75 million for fiscal 2019, including approximately $30 million for our corporate headquarters relocation, approximately $20 million for information technology enhancements, $20 million for new stores and store improvements, and the remainder for warehouse improvements and general corporate purposes.\nIn December 2017, significant changes were made to the federal tax law in the United States. Among its many provisions, the Tax Reform reduced the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the new rate, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the rate we expect to be in effect when the deferred taxes will reverse.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of February 2, 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 46%. Items driving differences between the blended U.S. federal statutory rates of 33.7% and the effective rate include (i) the change in tax rates from Tax Reform, (ii) state and local income taxes, (iii) lower rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and (iv) changes in our valuation allowances, including the reversal of the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes at the federal level, offset by increases in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nRevenues\n\n \u2022 Revenues increased 4.6% to $2,484.0 million, with comparable company sales up 6.0%. \nUnder the IP License Agreements, J.Crew Operating Corp, ( OpCo\u201d), our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, pays a fixed license fee of $59 million per annum to IPCo, which owns the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand. The license fees are payable on March 1 and September 1 of each fiscal year. The terms of the 2017 IP License Agreements are no less favorable than could be obtained in an arm's length transaction with an unaffiliated third party. These royalty payments have no impact on our consolidated results of operations and are not subject to the covenants under our credit facilities or the PIK Notes.\nRedemption. The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Notes Co-Issuers, in whole or in part, at any time, at a price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a make whole\u201d premium. The Notes are not subject to any mandatory redemption obligation, and there is no sinking fund provided for the Notes.\nAlthough Tax Reform significantly reduced the federal tax rate, it substantially reduced our ability to deduct interest expense beginning in fiscal 2018. The inability to use our interest deductions either in a current year, or carried forward to future years, has increased our projections of future taxable income.\nTerm Loan Facility\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nComparable company sales reflect: (i) net sales at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, (ii) e-commerce net sales, and (iii) shipping and handling fees, which are recorded as other revenues on our statements of operations. Comparable company sales exclude net sales from: (i) new stores that have not been open for 12 months, (ii) the 53rd week, if applicable, (iii) stores that experience a square footage change of at least 15 percent, (iv) stores that have been temporarily closed for at least 30 consecutive days, (v) permanently closed stores, (vi) temporary pop up\u201d stores and (vii) revenue from wholesale customers. Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, when calculating comparable company sales for fiscal 2018, we have realigned the weeks of last year to be consistent with the current year retail calendar.\nExecutive Overview\n o 15% of Parent's common equity, or 17,362,719 shares of Parent's class A common stock, $0.00001 par value per share; \nCyclicality and Seasonality\nIncome Taxes\n\nIP License Agreements\nInterest Rate. Initial borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin (which, in the case of the Amended Loans, was increased by 22 basis points) plus, at our option, either (a) a LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the relevant interest period adjusted for certain additional costs (subject to a floor) or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (3) a LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00%. New Term Loan Borrowings bear interest at 9% per annum payable in cash plus 3% per annum payable in kind.\nIn December 2016, J.Crew International, Inc. ( JCI\u201d) transferred an undivided 72.04% ownership interest in the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand to IPCo, and entered into a related intellectual property license agreement with IPCo. In July 2017, JCI transferred the remaining undivided 27.96% ownership interest in the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand to IPCo, which, together with the initial intellectual property contributed in December 2016, represent 100% of the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand, entered into a license agreement amending and restating the December 2016 license agreement with IPCo and entered into an additional intellectual property license agreement with IPCo (collectively, the IP License Agreements\u201d).\nABL Facility\n\nITEM 7.\n\nOur industry is cyclical and our revenues are affected by general economic conditions. Purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer confidence.\nWe are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected undiscounted future cash flows. The major components of our long-lived assets are store fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements. We test for impairment at the store level and the net book value is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected discounted future net cash flows is less than net book value.\nGeneral. On July 13, 2017, in connection with settlement of the Exchange Offer and the issuance of the Notes, J.Crew Brand, LLC and J.Crew Brand Corp. (together, the Notes Co-Issuers\u201d) and the Guarantors (as defined below) entered into (i) an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee and collateral agent, governing the terms of the Exchange Notes (the Exchange Notes Indenture\u201d) and (ii) an indenture with the Trustee and U.S. Bank, as collateral agent, governing the terms of the New Money Notes (the New Money Notes Indenture\u201d), which is in substantially the same form as the Exchange Notes Indenture.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 46%. Items driving differences between the blended U.S. federal statutory rates of 33.7% and the effective rate include (i) the change in tax rates from Tax Reform, (ii) state and local income taxes, (iii) lower rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and (iv) changes in our valuation allowances, including the reversal of the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes at the federal level, offset by increases in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nCash used in operating activities of $69.3 million in fiscal 2018 resulted from: (i) a net loss of $120.1 million and (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities of $49.4 million, primarily due to an increase in merchandise inventories as a result of an anticipated increase in revenues, partially offset by (iii) non-cash adjustments of $100.2 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a charge of $39.3 million for expected losses on the disposition of excess merchandise inventories.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the PIK Notes Issuer, an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million of PIK Notes. As part of the refinancing in July 2017, $565.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes were exchanged for $249.6 million of Exchange Notes and shares of preferred and common stock of the Parent. As of February 2, 2019, there were $1.0 million in aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes outstanding. The PIK Notes are: (i) senior unsecured obligations of the PIK Notes Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the PIK Notes Issuers' subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the PIK Notes Issuers' subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements.\nCash used in financing activities was $52.3 million in fiscal 2017 resulting from: (i) repayments pursuant to the Term Loan amendment, offset by (ii) the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes (as defined below).\nInterest expense, net of interest income, increased $27.0 million to $137.5 million in fiscal 2018 from $110.5 million last year. A summary of interest expense is as follows:\nThe benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2017 was $103.6 million, which included (i) a deferred tax benefit of $50.6 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name, which was written down by $129.8 million in fiscal 2017 and (ii) the remeasurement of deferred taxes of $18.5 million pursuant to Tax Reform.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 12%. Items driving differences between the U.S. federal statutory rates of 21% and the effective rate include (i) increase in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred taxes, (ii) state and local income taxes and (iii) lower rates in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $48.7 million, or 5.6%, to $824.0 million in fiscal 2018 from $872.7 million last year. This decrease primarily resulted from the following:\nImpairment losses were $10.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $141.2 million last year. The impairment losses were the result of the write-down of the following assets:\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. A key measure used in evaluating our business is comparable company sales. We also consider gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses in assessing the performance of our business.\nNet sales reflect our revenues from the sale of our merchandise less returns and discounts. We aggregate our merchandise into four sales categories: (i) women's apparel, (ii) men's apparel, (iii) children's apparel, and (iv) accessories, which include shoes, socks, jewelry, handbags, belts and hair accessories. The approximate percentage of our sales by these four categories is as follows:\n \u2022 Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. \n\nAt the end of fiscal 2018, we owned substantial excess merchandise inventories. As a result, we recorded a charge of $39.3 million for expected losses on the disposition of those inventories.\nAs of February 2, 2019, we operated 203 J.Crew retail stores, 174 J.Crew factory stores (including 42 J.Crew Mercantile stores) and 129 Madewell stores throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong; compared to 235 J.Crew retail stores, 176 J.Crew factory stores (including 42 J.Crew Mercantile stores) and 121 Madewell stores as of February 3, 2018.\n\nA summary of our revenues by brand is as follows:\nNet Loss\nContractual Obligations\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from (i) debt service requirements, including required (a) quarterly principal repayments and (b) repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, if any, as defined, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) working capital. Management anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 will be approximately $65 to $75 million, including approximately $30 million for our corporate headquarters relocation, approximately $20 million for information technology enhancements, $20 million for new stores and store improvements, and the remainder for warehouse improvements and general corporate purposes. Management expects to pay interest of approximately $125 million in fiscal 2019 to fund debt service obligations. During fiscal 2019, we expect to open 10 Madewell stores and close approximately 20 stores.\nCash used in financing activities was $12.9 million in fiscal 2016 resulting from: (i) principal repayments of the Term Loan Facility and (ii) costs paid in connection with the refinancing of debt.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $48.4 million, or 5.9%, to $872.7 million in fiscal 2017 from $824.3 million in fiscal 2016. This increase primarily resulted from the following:\n (e) Amounts shown do not include interest. \nComparable Company Sales\n\nInterest Rate. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 13% per annum, and interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes mature on September 15, 2021.\nNet Loss\n o the repayment of $150.5 million principal amount of term loans then outstanding under the Term Loan Facility; \nDebt Exchange and Refinancing\n \u2022 the level of customer service that we provide, \n\nGross margin decreased to 33.6% in fiscal 2018 from 37.8% last year. The decrease in gross margin was driven by: (i) a 490 basis point deterioration in merchandise margin primarily due to higher shipping and handling driven by e-commerce growth, a higher level of promotional activity and increased penetration of our wholesale business, offset by (ii) a 70 basis point decrease in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAs a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 33.2% in fiscal 2018 from 36.8% last year.\n o the raising of additional borrowings under the Term Loan Facility of $30.0 million (at a 2% discount) provided by our Sponsors (the New Term Loan Borrowings\u201d), the net proceeds of which were also applied, in part, to finance the repayment of the $150.5 million principal amount of term loans referenced above. \n (c) Calculated on a 52-week basis. \nIn August 2018, a pronouncement was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nOther revenues increased $69.4 million, or 65.6%, to $175.3 million from $105.9 million last year, primarily as a result of revenue from wholesale customers.\n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nGross profit increased $16.3 million to $897.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $881.3 million in fiscal 2016. This increase resulted from the following factors:\n2017Amendment. On July 13, 2017, concurrently with the settlement of the Exchange Offer, we amended our Term Loan Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the interest rate applicable to the loans held by consenting lenders, which represented 88% of lenders, (the Consenting Lenders\u201d; and the loans held by the Consenting Lenders, the Amended Loans\u201d) by 22 basis points, (ii) increase the amount of amortization payable to Consenting Lenders, (iii) provide for the New Term Loan Borrowings of $30.0 million, (iv) amend certain covenants and events of default and (v) direct Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent under the Term Loan Facility, to dismiss, with prejudice, certain litigation regarding the Initial Transferred IP (and the related actions). Additionally, we repaid $150.5 million of principal amount of term loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, which was financed with (i) the net proceeds from the New Money Notes of $94.1 million, (ii) the net proceeds from the New Term Loan Borrowings of $29.4 million and (iii) cash on hand of $27.0 million.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\n (b) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n (a) Consists of 53 weeks. \nResults of Operations-Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017\n (a) Operating lease obligations represent obligations under various long-term operating leases entered in the normal course of business for retail and factory stores, office space and equipment requiring minimum annual rentals. Operating lease expense is a significant component of our operating expenses. The lease terms range for various periods of time in various rental markets and are entered into at different times, which mitigates exposure to market changes that could have a material effect on our results of operations within any given year. Operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and other occupancy costs, which aggregate to approximately 44% of the minimum lease obligations. \nNotes\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nIn February 2016 and July 2018, pronouncements were issued with respect to the accounting for leases. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, the pronouncements require lessees to recognize right-of-use assets ( ROU asset\u201d) and right-of-use liabilities ( ROU liability\u201d) for leases with terms of more than one year. The ROU liability is measured as the present value of the lease obligations, which we estimate to be in the range of $590 million to $640 million at the adoption date. The ROU asset reflects the amount of the ROU liability less lease-related deferred credits, which we estimate to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million at the adoption date. We expect to adopt the pronouncements in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the effective date method whereby initial application occurs on the date of adoption with comparative periods unchanged. Additionally, we plan to utilize the package of practical expedients permitted by the transition guidance, which allows us to carry forward our identification of contracts that are or contain leases, historical lease classification and initial direct costs for existing leases.\n (c) Relates primarily to commitments incurred in connection with our e-commerce platform. \n \u2022 We opened eight Madewell stores and one J.Crew retail store. We closed 33 J.Crew retail stores and two J.Crew factory stores. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 pricing, \nRevenues\n \u2022 certain amendments to the indenture governing the PIK Notes; \n (c) Consists primarily of revenues from wholesale customers and shipping and handling fees. \n\nInterest expense, net of interest income, increased $31.1 million to $110.5 million in fiscal 2017 from $79.4 million in fiscal 2016. A summary of interest expense is as follows:\n o $249,596,000 aggregate principal amount of 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 issued by J.Crew Brand, LLC and J.Crew Brand Corp. (the Exchange Notes\u201d), which are secured primarily by the U.S. intellectual property assets held by J.Crew Domestic Brand, LLC ( IPCo\u201d); \nWe have an ABL Facility, which is governed by a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents and lenders party thereto, that, following the Sixth Amendment described below, provides for a $375 million senior secured asset-based revolving line of credit (which may be increased by up to $75 million in certain circumstances), subject to a borrowing base limitation. We cannot borrow in excess of $375 million under the ABL Facility without the consent of holders of at least a majority of the loans outstanding under our Term Loan Facility. The borrowing base under the ABL Facility equals the sum of: 90% of the eligible credit card receivables; plus, 85% of eligible accounts; plus, 90% (or 92.5% for the period of August 1 through December 31 of any fiscal year) of the net recovery percentage of eligible inventory multiplied by the cost of eligible inventory; plus 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible letters of credit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible letter of credit inventory; plus, 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible in-transit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible in-transit inventory; plus, 100% of qualified cash; minus, all availability and inventory reserves. The ABL Facility includes borrowing capacity in the form of letters of credit up to $200 million, and up to $25 million in U.S. dollars for loans on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, and is available in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. Any amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are due and payable in full on the maturity date of November 17, 2021.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nAs of the date of this report, there were outstanding borrowings of approximately $214 million under the ABL Facility, with excess availability of approximately $97 million.\nTotal revenues increased $110.3 million, or 4.6%, to $2,484.0 million from $2,373.7 million last year, driven primarily by an increase in sales of women's apparel, specifically pants, sweaters and knits. Revenues generated in the 53rd week last year were $28.6 million. Comparable company sales increased 6.0% following a decrease of 6.1% last year.\n\n\n (b) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nGross Profit\nInterest Expense, Net\n\n \u2022 an amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2014 (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) to, among other things, facilitate the following related transactions: \nPrincipal Repayments. We are required to make principal repayments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility (excluding the New Term Loan Borrowings), or $3.9 million, on the last business day of January, April, July, and October. We are also required (i) to repay the term loan based on an annual calculation of excess cash flow, as defined in the agreement, (ii) in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, to make a principal repayment of $11.9 million which is equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of Amended Loans outstanding on July 13, 2017 and (iii) beginning on July 31, 2019, on the last business day of January, April, July and October, to make additional principal repayments of $1.5 million equal to 0.125% of the aggregate principal amount of Amended Loans outstanding on July 13, 2017. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is March 5, 2021.\n\nSee note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the terms of the ABL Facility.\n (b) As of February 2, 2019, we have recorded $25.3 million in liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, which are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. While these tax liabilities may result in future cash outflows, management cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the effective settlement of these positions. \nOur business is seasonal and as a result, our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have four distinct selling seasons that align with our four fiscal quarters. Revenues are usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter, particularly in December when customers make holiday purchases. In fiscal 2018, we realized approximately 30% of our revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nInvesting Activities\nThe weighted average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility was 6.18% on February 2, 2019. The applicable margin (i) in effect for base rate borrowings was, (x) in the case of term loans, other than the New Term Loan Borrowings and the Amended Loans, 2.00%, (y) in the case of the Amended Loans, 2.22% and (z) in the case of the New Term Loan Borrowings, 12.00% (of which 3.00% is payable in kind) and (ii) with respect to LIBOR borrowings was, (x) in the case of term loans, other than the New Term Loan Borrowings and the Amended Loans, 3.00% and the LIBOR Floor, (y) in the case of the Amended Loans, 3.22% and the LIBOR Floor and (z) in the case of the New Term Loan Borrowings, 12.00% (of which 3.00% is payable in kind), respectively, at February 2, 2019.\nOur gross profit may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold while others, like us, exclude all or a portion of them from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOperating Activities\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under the ABL Facility. Our primary cash needs are (i) meeting debt service requirements, (ii) capital expenditures in connection with making information technology enhancements, opening new stores and improving our existing stores and making investments in our distribution network and (iii) funding working capital requirements. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts payable and other current liabilities. See -Outlook\u201d below.\nBelow is consolidating statement of operations and comprehensive loss information reflecting the elimination of the accounts of J.Crew BrandCo from our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended February 2, 2019.\nChange in Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in each of the indentures, as applicable), the Notes Co-Issuers will be required to offer to repay all of the Notes at 100% of the aggregate principal amount repaid plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase.\n\nNet loss increased $99.5 million to $123.2 million in fiscal 2017 from $23.7 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was due to: (i) higher impairment losses of $133.4 million, (ii) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $48.4 million and (iii) an increase in interest expense of $31.1 million, offset by (iv) an increase in the benefit for income taxes of $96.8 million, (v) an increase in gross profit of $16.3 million and (vi) a decrease in loss on refinancing of $0.4 million.\nThe proceeds from the license fees to IPCo are used by IPCo and J.Crew Brand, LLC, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, J.Crew BrandCo\u201d), to meet debt service requirements on the Notes. Any license fees in excess of the debt service requirements are loaned back to OpCo on a subordinated basis. As of February 2, 2019, J.Crew BrandCo had total assets of $403.1 million, consisting of intangible assets of $250.2 million, receivable due from OpCo of $128.0 million, license fee receivable of $24.6 million and cash and cash equivalents of $0.3 million, and total liabilities of $358.1 million related to the Notes. For the year ended February 2, 2019, IPCo earned royalty revenue of $59.0 million. The Notes are guaranteed by the intangible assets of J.Crew BrandCo.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries completed the following interrelated liability management transactions:\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events, \n \u2022 a private exchange offer (the Exchange Offer\u201d) pursuant to which $565.7 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 7.75%/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2019 (the PIK Notes\u201d) issued by Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent (the PIK Notes Issuer\u201d), were exchanged for aggregate consideration consisting of: \nThe following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenues as well as selected store data:\n \u2022 We account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold and recognizing revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. We review our gift card liability on an ongoing basis and recognize income from unredeemed gift card liability on a ratable basis over the estimated period of redemption. We defer revenue and recognize a liability for rewards points issued in connection with our customer loyalty program for the rewards points expected to be redeemed for merchandise in the future. \nCovenants. Each of the indentures contains covenants covering (i) the payment of principal and interest, (ii) maintenance of an office or agency for the payment of the Notes, (iii) reports to the applicable Trustee and holders of the Notes, (iv) stay, extension and usury laws, (v) payment of taxes, (vi) existence, (vii) maintenance of properties and (viii) maintenance of insurance. Each of the indentures relating to the Notes also includes covenants that (i) limit the ability to transfer the collateral and (ii) limit liens that may be imposed on the assets of the Guarantors, which covenants are, in each case, subject to certain exceptions set forth in each of the indentures.\nCash provided by financing activities was $55.1 million in fiscal 2018 resulting primarily from: (i) net borrowings under the ABL Facility, offset by (ii) quarterly principal repayments of the Term Loan Facility.\n \u2022 We recognize sales made in our stores at the point of sale, sales through our e-commerce business at an estimated date of receipt by a customer and sales to a wholesale customer at the time ownership is transferred. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling sales are classified as other revenues. We make estimates of future sales returns related to current period sales. Management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns. We record an asset in other current assets for the inventory expected to be returned and a liability in other current liabilities for the sales expected to be refunded. On the statement of operations and comprehensive loss, we present the change in the liability in total revenues and the change in the asset in cost of goods sold. \n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nGross profit decreased $61.9 million to $835.7 million in fiscal 2018 from $897.6 million last year. This decrease resulted from the following factors:\nCash provided by operating activities of $62.9 million in fiscal 2017 resulted from: (i) non-cash adjustments of $147.9 million and (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities of $38.2 million due to working capital fluctuations, partially offset by (iii) net loss of $123.2 million.\nCash provided by operating activities of $137.8 million in fiscal 2016 resulted from: (i) non-cash adjustments of $138.1 million and (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities of $23.4 million due to working capital fluctuations, partially offset by (iii) net loss of $23.7 million.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 22%. Items driving differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate include (i) the recognition of certain valuation allowances, (ii) lower rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, (iii) reserves for uncertain tax positions and (iv) state and local income taxes.\n \u2022 the number of stores we open, close (including on a temporary basis for renovations) and expand in any period. \nInterest Expense, Net\nOn February 2, 2019, standby letters of credit were $64.7 million, outstanding borrowings were $70.8 million, and excess availability, as defined, was $233.7 million. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility was 5.05% on February 2, 2019. Average short-term borrowings under the ABL Facility were $70.3 million and $9.1 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.\nGross Profit\nAt the end of fiscal 2018, we owned substantial excess merchandise inventories. As a result, we recorded a charge of $39.3 million for expected losses on the disposition of those inventories.\nNew Money Notes Collateral. The New Money Notes and the guarantees thereof are general senior secured obligations of the Notes Co-Issuers and the Guarantors, secured on a first priority lien basis by the Additional Transferred IP and certain other assets, and on a second priority lien basis by the Initial Transferred IP, subject, in each case, to permitted liens under the New Money Notes Indenture and the intercreditor agreement.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include all operating expenses not included in cost of goods sold, primarily administrative payroll, store expenses other than occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, certain warehousing expenses and credit card fees. These expenses do not necessarily vary proportionally with net sales.\nImpairment Losses\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n (a) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nFinancing Activities\nWe enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate a portion of our international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure reimbursement obligations under certain insurance and import programs and lease obligations. As of February 2, 2019, we had the following obligations under letters of credit in future periods.\nAn asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxes are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant.\nTotal revenues decreased $57.9 million, or 2.4%, to $2,373.7 million in fiscal 2017 from $2,431.6 million in fiscal 2016, driven primarily by a decrease in sales of men's apparel, specifically shirts, suiting and pants. Revenues generated in the 53rd week of fiscal 2017 were $28.6 million. Comparable company sales decreased 6.1% in fiscal 2017 following a decrease of 6.1% in fiscal 2016.\nImpact of Inflation\n o the transfer of the remaining undivided 27.96% ownership interest in the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand (the Additional Transferred IP\u201d) to IPCo, which, together with the undivided 72.04% ownership interest transferred in December 2016 (the Initial Transferred IP\u201d) represent 100% of the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand (the Transferred IP\u201d), and the execution of related license agreements; \n o 189,688 shares of Parent's 7% non-convertible perpetual series A preferred stock, no par value per share, with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $189,688,000 (which aggregate liquidation preference was $194,167,061 as of February 2, 2019); and \n</table>\nA summary of highlights for fiscal 2018 is as follows:\n (b) We exclude a portion of our distribution network costs from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses. Our gross profit therefore may not be directly comparable to that of some of our competitors. \n\nMadewell sales increased $78.3 million, or 22.9%, to $419.8 million in fiscal 2017 from $341.5 million in fiscal 2016. Madewell comparable sales increased 14.4% in fiscal 2017 following an increase of 6.5% in fiscal 2016.\n (b) Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. \nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 competition, \n (a) Includes capital expenditures for warehouse improvements and general corporate purposes. \n\nManagement believes that our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, projected cash flow from operations and amounts available under the ABL Facility will be adequate to fund our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Our ability to satisfy these obligations and to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our financing arrangements depends on our future operating performance, which in turn, may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in part I of this report.\nNet Sales\n (a) Consists of 53 weeks. \nThis discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during each of the years in a three-year period ended February 2, 2019. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years 2018 and 2016 ended on February 2, 2019 and January 28, 2017, respectively, and consisted of 52 weeks each. Fiscal year 2017 ended on February 3, 2018 and consisted of 53 weeks. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGross profit is determined by subtracting our cost of goods sold from our revenues. Cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, freight, design, buying and production costs, occupancy costs related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and all shipping costs associated with our e-commerce business. Cost of goods sold varies directly with revenues, and therefore, is usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter. Cost of goods sold also changes as we expand or contract our store base, which results in higher or lower store occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our revenues.\nMerchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. We capitalize certain design, purchasing and warehousing costs in inventory. We evaluate all of our inventories to determine excess inventories based on estimated future sales. Excess inventories may be disposed of through our e-commerce business, factory stores and other liquidation methods. Based on historical results experienced through various methods of disposition, we write down the carrying value of inventories that are not expected to be sold at or above cost. Additionally, we reduce the cost of inventories based on an estimate of lost or stolen items each period.\n o the issuance of $97.0 million aggregate principal amount of an additional series of 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 by J.Crew Brand, LLC and J.Crew Brand Corp. (the New Money Notes\u201d and, together with the Exchange Notes, the Notes\u201d), subject to the same terms and conditions as the Exchange Notes, for cash at a 3% discount, subject to the terms of the note purchase agreement, dated June 12, 2017, the proceeds of which were loaned on a subordinated basis to us and were applied, in part, to finance the repayment of the $150.5 million principal amount of term loans referenced above; and \nMeasuring the change in year-over-year comparable company sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our business. Various factors affect comparable company sales, including:\nJ.Crew sales decreased $170.5 million, or 8.4%, to $1,848.0 million in fiscal 2017 from $2,018.5 million in fiscal 2016. J.Crew comparable sales decreased 9.6% in fiscal 2017 following a decrease of 7.8% in fiscal 2016.\nImpairment Losses\nJ.Crew sales decreased $68.5 million, or 3.7%, to $1,779.5 million from $1,848.0 million last year. J.Crew comparable sales increased 1.5% following a decrease of 9.6% last year.\nFinancing Arrangements\nOther revenues increased $34.3 million, or 47.9%, to $105.9 million in fiscal 2017 from $71.6 million in fiscal 2016, primarily a result of revenue from wholesale customers.", "item_7_tables": "Table 86: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>
