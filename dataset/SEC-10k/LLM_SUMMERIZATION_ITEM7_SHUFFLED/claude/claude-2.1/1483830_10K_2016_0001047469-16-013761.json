Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe historical financial statements included elsewhere in this document reflect the consolidated assets, liabilities and operations of Niska Gas Storage Partners LLC (\"Niska Partners\" or the \"Company\") as at March 31, 2016 and 2015, and for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The following discussion of the historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and accompanying notes of the Company included elsewhere in this document. In addition, this discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may result in actual results differing from statements we make. See \"Forward-Looking Statements.\" Factors that could cause actual results to differ include those risks and uncertainties that are discussed in \"Risk Factors.\"\nOverview\nWe operate the AECO HubTM, which consists of the Countess and Suffield gas storage facilities in Alberta, Canada, and the Wild Goose and Salt Plains gas storage facilities in California and Oklahoma, respectively. Niska Partners markets gas storage services of working gas capacity in addition to optimizing storage capacity with its own proprietary gas purchases at each of these facilities. We also operate a natural gas marketing business which is an extension of our propriety optimization activities in Canada. The Company has a total of 243.9 Bcf of working gas capacity among its facilities, including 1.9 Bcf leased from a third-party pipeline company.\nWe earn revenues by providing natural gas storage services on a long-term firm (\"LTF\") contract basis for which we receive monthly reservation fees for fixed amounts of storage, providing storage services on a short-term firm (\"STF\") contract basis, where a customer pays a fixed fee to inject a specified quantity of natural gas on a specified date or dates and a fixed fee to withdraw on a specified future date or dates, and optimization, where we purchase and sell gas on an economically hedged basis in order to improve facility utilization at margins that can be higher than those from third-party contracts. Proprietary optimization activities occur when the Company purchases and sells natural gas for its own account. Our revenues related to our marketing business are included in proprietary optimization activities. We have aggregated all of our activities in one reportable operating segment for financial reporting purposes. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nIn June 2015, the Company, the Manager, Holdco and certain of their affiliates entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Brookfield. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Brookfield will acquire all of the Company's outstanding common units for $4.225 per common unit in cash and will acquire the Managing Member and the IDRs in the Company prior to June 14, 2017.\nThe closing of the Transaction is dependent on the satisfaction of certain conditions related to regulatory requirements, including the approval of the CPUC. On May 12, 2016, the CPUC issued a Proposed Decision, which if finally approved will allow the transfer of control of Wild Goose to Brookfield and also allow the Transaction to proceed to close in accordance with the Merger Agreement. The Proposed Decision can still be amended prior to being voted on by the CPUC and may or may not be approved by the CPUC.\nThe fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 reflected a continuation of difficult market conditions for Niska. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $17.1 million, compared to $66.7 million in fiscal 2015 and $140.0 million in fiscal 2014. Included in the fiscal 2016 amounts are benefits of inventory write-downs of $45.2 million. Fiscal 2015 included a one-time contract termination settlement with our largest customer of $26.0 million and benefits from inventory write-downs of $23.1 million. Excluding these amounts, Adjusted EBITDA would have been negative $28.1 million for fiscal 2016 and positive $17.6 million for fiscal 2015. The unfavorable financial results in fiscal 2016 resulted from extraordinarily low seasonal spreads which substantially reduced the value of our storage\nservices, and reduced price volatility resulting from increased gas supply in the market which, in turn, reduced our ability to capture additional value based on changes in natural gas prices.\nIn addition, in fiscal 2016 and 2015 the Company recorded non-cash charges of additional depreciation of $24.5 million and $64.7 million respectively, associated with migration of cushion gas at its Canadian-based facilities. The combination of poor market conditions and non-cash charges resulted in a net loss for the fiscal 2016 of $103.3 million, compared to fiscal 2015 net loss of $350.7 million.\nThe Company's available liquidity consists of amounts available under its Revolving Credit Facilities and its Short-Term Credit Facility. In February 2016, the Company completed an amendment and extension of its Credit Agreement, which reduced the maximum capacity to $320.0 million and extends the term of the original agreement from June 29, 2016 to September 30, 2016 and allows for an additional term extension to December 31, 2016 providing that the Transaction has closed. The Company's fixed charge coverage ratio (\"FCCR\") has been below 1.1:1.0 since the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and as a result the Company continued to be unable to borrow the last 15% of availability under the Revolving Credit Facilities without triggering an event of default.\nIn connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Brookfield agreed to lend up to $50.0 million to the Company under a short-term credit facility to be used for working capital purposes. During fiscal 2016, reduced liquidity due to lower profitability was partially offset by the funds available under the Short-Term Credit Facility. As at March 31, 2016, the balance under the Short-term Credit Facility was $40.1 million, and the Company had $66.8 million of total available liquidity, compared to $80.1 million at March 31, 2015.\nAs we begin fiscal 2017, market conditions for natural gas storage are improving, with widening seasonal spreads and increasing volatility. The Company estimates that, based on expected revenues, of which over 80% have already been transacted across all revenue strategies, and expected costs, the Company will generate sufficient cash flow to fund its operations for the next twelve months, except for the repayment of the outstanding balances of the Revolving Credit Facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility on their respective maturity dates. Failure to repay the Revolving Credit Facilities when due would also constitute an event of default under the terms of the 6.50% Senior Notes.\nOn June 9, 2016, the CPUC issued a decision which approved the transfer of control of the Wild Goose facility to Brookfield, effective immediately. The Company believes that it is probable that the Merger will be completed on or before July 31, 2016 at which time the Company will pursue replacement financing. Should the merger not close as anticipated, the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facilities on September 30, 2016 would require the Company to seek a further extension of the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay the amounts projected to be outstanding at that time. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain a further extension of the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay our Revolving Credit Facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility upon maturity.\nSee also \"How We Evaluate Our Operations-Capitalization, Leverage and Liquidity\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nA summary of financial and operating data for the

We had write-downs of inventory of $4.3 million, $63.8 million and $4.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding these non-cash items, which do not affect Adjusted EBITDA, our realized optimization revenues were $20.5 million, $38.1 million and $85.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n(2)Loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended March 31, 2014 relates to the redemption of our 8.875% Senior Notes due 2018 in March 2014.

Distribution in this report. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution to net earnings (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is shown above.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, unrealized risk management gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, foreign exchange gains and losses, write-downs of inventory, gains and losses on asset dispositions, non-cash compensation, asset impairments and other income. We believe the adjustments for other income are similar in nature to the traditional adjustments to net earnings used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and adjustment for these items results in an appropriate representation of this financial measure. Cash Available for Distribution is defined as Adjusted EBITDA reduced by interest expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), income taxes paid, maintenance capital expenditures and other income. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution are used as supplemental\nfinancial measures by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as commercial banks and ratings agencies, to assess:\n\u2022 the financial performance of our assets, operations and return on capital without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;\n\u2022 the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and make distributions to our equity holders;\n\u2022 repeatable operating performance that is not distorted by non-recurring items or market volatility; and\n\u2022 the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects.\nThe GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution is net earnings. The non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution should not be considered as alternatives to net earnings (loss). Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and have important limitations as analytical tools. Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor Cash Available for Distribution should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings (loss) and are defined differently by different companies, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe recognize that the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as an evaluative tool may have certain limitations, including:\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and impacts our ability to generate profits and cash flows. Therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense may have material limitations;\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation and amortization expense. Because we use capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits. Therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense may have material limitations;\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not include provision for income taxes. Because the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our costs, any measure that excludes income tax expense may have material limitations;\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not allow us to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non-recurring items that materially affect our net earnings or loss.\nSimilarly, Cash Available for Distribution has certain limitations because it accounts for some, but not all, of the above limitations.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue through long- and short-term contracts for the storage of natural gas for third-party customers and the proprietary optimization of storage capacity that is\nuncontracted, underutilized or available only on a short-term basis. We evaluate our business on the basis of the following key measures:\n\u2022 volume and fees derived from fee-based contracts;\n\u2022 volume and margin derived from our proprietary optimization activities;\n\u2022 operating, general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA;\n\u2022 capitalization and leverage; and\n\u2022 borrowing base revolver availability, liquidity, and compliance with debt covenants.\nVolume and Fees Derived from Fee-based Contracts\nWe provide fee-based natural gas storage services to our customers under long-term firm (LTF) and short-term firm (STF) contracts. When a customer enters into a LTF contract, the customer is obligated to pay us monthly reservation fees for a fixed amount of storage which is usable by the customer at their option subject to contractual limits. These fees are fixed regardless of the actual use by the customer, and we also collect a variable fee when the services are actually used in order to allow us to recover our variable operating costs. The volume-weighted average life of our LTF contracts at March 31, 2016 was 2.6 years. Reservation fees comprise over 90% of the revenue generated under LTF contracts and provide a baseline of revenue to support our operating and general and administrative costs.\nWe also provide fee-based services under short-term firm (STF) contracts, where a customer pays a fixed fee to inject a specified quantity of gas on a specified date or dates and to withdraw on a specified future date or dates.\nWe monitor both the volume and price of our LTF and STF contracts in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing efforts as well as the relative attractiveness of each of these types of contracts compared to each other as well as in comparison to our optimization strategy. During periods when market values for storage capacity are higher, we typically use more of our capacity under LTF contracts. The fees we are able to generate from our LTF and STF contracts reflect market conditions, including interest rates. The capacity used for STF contracts depends, among other things, on available capacity not reserved under LTF contracts as well as market demand and contract rates available for these services.\nVolume and Margin Derived from Our Proprietary Optimization Activities\nWhen market conditions warrant, we enter into economically hedged transactions with available capacity. This can achieve higher margins than can be obtained from third-party contracts. Because we economically hedge our transactions, we are able to determine in advance the minimum margins that will be realized and add incremental margins by re-hedging as market conditions change.\nAt times, if spreads move favorably, such as if winter gas prices fall below forward prices for the following summer, we can further increase margins that have been substantially locked in by choosing to hold inventory into a subsequent period and re-hedging the transaction. This has the result of increasing our cash flow margins and overall profitability although for accounting purposes the income is recognized in a later period, causing cyclicality in our reported revenues and profits.\nWhen evaluating the performance of our optimization business, we focus on our realized optimization margins, excluding the impact of unrealized hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs. For accounting purposes, our realized optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs, which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period. However, because substantially all inventory is economically hedged, any inventory write-downs are offset by hedging gains and any unrealized hedging losses are offset by gains when the inventory is sold. These offsetting gains and losses may occur in different periods.\nOperating Expenses\nOur most significant variable operating expenses are fuel and electricity costs. These operating expenses vary significantly based upon the amount of natural gas we inject or withdraw throughout the year and the price of the energy commodity at the time of purchase. Variable operating expenses are partially offset by the variable fees we collect from our LTF contracts. The fixed component of our operating expenses include salaries and labor, parts and supplies, surface and mineral lease rentals and other general operating costs. These fixed operating expenses are more stable from year to year but can fluctuate due to unforeseen repairs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, legal, accounting and tax consulting fees, and our office leases.\nCapitalization, Leverage and Liquidity\nWe regularly monitor our credit metrics. Our most important credit metric is our fixed charge coverage ratio, or FCCR, which is contained in the Indenture to our 6.50% Senior Notes and our Credit Agreement. The FCCR measures our Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges, both of which are defined in the Indenture and Credit Agreement. As discussed below, when our FCCR is below 2.0 times, we are restricted in our ability to issue new debt. When our FCCR is below 1.75 times, we are restricted in our ability to pay distributions. When our FCCR is below 1.1 times, we are unable to borrow the last 15% of availability without triggering an event of default. We also monitor our ratio of long-term and total debt to Adjusted EBITDA and our ratio of debt to debt plus equity. While these metrics are not included in our Indenture or Credit Agreement, they are common metrics used to measure the credit-worthiness of companies, including those similar to us.\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had a FCCR of 0.3 to 1.0, a ratio of total debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 42.8 times, a ratio of long-term debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 34.2 times and a ratio of long-term debt to long-term debt plus equity of 87.9%.\nFunding the purchase of proprietary optimization inventory can consume a significant portion of our available working capital. Accordingly, we closely monitor the utilization and remaining available capacity under our credit facilities and actively pursue additional short-term firm contracts when we determine it is appropriate to maintain liquidity.\nFactors that Impact Our Business\nFactors that impact the performance of specific components of our business from period to period include the following:\nMarket Conditions for Natural Gas Storage\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2016, the difference between summer and winter prices in the natural gas futures market, referred to as the seasonal spread, remained extremely narrow. This condition\nresulted from numerous factors, including, but not limited to: (i) production curtailments in Alberta due to prolonged compressor outages on the TransCanada Alberta System and high cash prices at PG&A Citygate during injection season; (ii) lower levels of natural gas in storage which led to increased demand in the cash market; (iii) real or perceived changes in overall supply and demand fundamentals; (iv) the development of new pipeline infrastructure connecting new supply to markets; (v) the weather during the first part of winter being milder than normal; and (vi) a material year-over-year increase in natural gas production in the United States as well as in Western Canada during the winter withdrawal season. These market conditions have negatively impacted our revenues during the year ended March 31, 2016 by eroding the prices we can charge for long and short-term firm contracting services, as well as reducing the profitability of our optimization activities, where we make economically hedged natural gas purchases for our own account.\nThe combination of reductions in natural gas prices, collateral required to support our retail marketing operations, costs associated with the requirements for temporary reservoir pressure support and unfavorable market conditions which have prevented us from realizing additional revenues and earnings have reduced the liquidity available under our credit facilities. Continued reduction in amounts available under our credit facilities may continue to restrict our ability to pursue optimization strategies. The inability to pursue such revenue strategies may have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenues and profitability.\nMarket conditions for natural gas storage can change rapidly as a result of a number of factors, including weather patterns, overall storage levels across North America in the markets we serve, current and anticipated levels of natural gas supply and demand, and constraints on pipeline infrastructure capacity. Accordingly, current market conditions may not be a reliable predictor of future market conditions. Longer term, we believe several factors may contribute to meaningful growth in North American natural gas demand, including: (i) exports of North American Liquefied Natural Gas; (ii) fuel switching for power generation from coal to natural gas; (iii) construction of new gas-fired power plants; (iv) growing exports to Mexico; and (v) growth in base-load industrial demand, all of which could bolster the demand for, and the commercial value of, natural gas storage. We are unable to predict the timing or magnitude of such events nor can we predict the ultimate impact they may have on our results of operations.\nWorking Gas Storage Capacity\nChanges in working gas capacity are expected to impact the level of our revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, our contract for 5.6 Bcf of the 8.5 Bcf leased capacity on NGPL expired thereby reducing our gas storage capacity to approximately 244.9 Bcf . On May 1, 2016, 1.0 Bcf of the remaining 2.9 Bcf leased capacity on NGPL expired, thereby reducing our gas storage capacity to approximately 243.9 Bcf. We do not expect these changes will cause a significant reduction to future earnings.\nCarried Inventory\nWhen winter gas prices fall below forward prices for the following summer we may defer the withdrawal of proprietary optimization inventory until the next fiscal year in order to reduce operating costs and add incremental margin and economic value, independent of the period in which that revenue is earned. This may result in the deferral of realized earnings and cash flow from one fiscal year to the next. This was evident during the year ended March 31, 2015, when increased gas supply in the United States resulted in a reduction in the demand for natural gas in storage and resulted in an overall decline in near-term natural gas prices. Due to the contango position of the forward market, we deferred the withdrawal of proprietary optimization inventory until fiscal 2016. As a result, proprietary optimization inventory at March 31, 2015 was relatively high at approximately 48 MDth, as compared to March 31, 2016 proprietary inventory levels of 26 MDth. The year over year decrease in proprietary\noptimization was driven by a reduction in capacity allocated to the strategy in the current period, offset by an increased allocation to fee-based transactions.\nCushion Migration and Pressure Support\nCushion migration occurs when hydrocarbons move to an area of the storage reservoir where effective support in cycling a facility's working gas is no longer provided. During the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded charges to depreciation expense of $24.5 million, $64.7 million and $nil, respectively, related to 2.4 Bcf, 6.2 Bcf and nil Bcf of proprietary cushion estimated to have migrated at our Canadian facilities. We currently estimate that ongoing cushion migration could require an annual expenditure of approximately $4.0 million to $6.0 million to replace the cushion gas that has migrated. These estimates include assumptions about storage levels and cycling requirements which can vary significantly depending on operating conditions.\nIn addition, our storage facilities may require additional natural gas to provide temporary pressure support during periods of high activity to meet cycling requirements and performance demands related to our gas in storage. These volumes fluctuate from year to year along with our cycling requirements. These cycling requirements are managed through a combination of strategies which are adapted to changes in natural gas market conditions. Typically, the use of gas to provide temporary pressure support results in net revenue gains because the cost to acquire natural gas in the nearer term is lower than the price of natural gas for future delivery.\nBackwardation, a condition where the price of natural gas in the near term is higher than the price for future delivery, occurred in the winter of fiscal 2014 and spring of fiscal 2015. This increased our costs to manage our cycling requirements, which include the purchase or lease of natural gas used for temporary pressure support. The cost of temporary pressure support gas was approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2016 (fiscal 2015-$40.0 million). Over the upcoming four years, the expected cumulative cost of temporary pressure support gas is $5.5 million which relates to our commitments to lease certain volumes of natural gas to address our future temporary pressure support needs. In the event that natural gas storage market conditions become more favorable, the cost of managing our operational requirements could be reduced. However, if the conditions deteriorate, the cost of managing our operational requirements will increase.\nMaterial Agreements\nIn May 2014, we entered into a new contract with TransCanada, our largest volumetric customer. This new contract replaced a previous storage agreement which provided TransCanada with approximately 40 Bcf of storage capacity at our AECO facilities and had a term that extended to 2030. Under the previous storage agreement both parties had the option to terminate at the end of defined five-year intervals, including April 1, 2015. TransCanada elected to terminate this agreement and entered into a new agreement with us which extends until 2020. The new agreement provides TransCanada with an initial storage capacity of approximately 40 Bcf which will be reduced to approximately 20 Bcf on April 1, 2017. By exercising its early termination rights, TransCanada was obligated to make an early termination payment to us of $26.0 million. This payment was recognized in long-term firm revenue in fiscal 2015. The new rate under the renegotiated contract is lower than the rate previously in effect in prior fiscal periods, resulting in a decrease to LTF revenues in fiscal 2016.\nVariable Costs\nThe variable operating costs of our facilities are primarily comprised of costs associated with natural gas and electricity for compressor operations. Our operating costs are affected by the amount and price of energy used to inject and withdraw natural gas from our facilities and by the number and timing of gas injections and withdrawals. For example, if we experience large injections of natural gas\nin the early summer (instead of a steady rate of injections throughout the summer), we would have higher costs in our first quarter and lower than expected costs in the second quarter. A mild winter could lead to less withdrawals in total, and therefore lower overall fuel and power costs because less injections would occur in filling our storage facilities. These cost variances could be partially offset by similar variances in long-term contract revenues. During the year ended March 31, 2016, operating expenses were lower than the year ended March 31, 2015, principally due to lower facility utilization, and lower average fuel and electricity prices.\nCarrying Costs and Availability of Liquidity\nOur cost of capital and the amount of our available working capital impacts the amount of capacity utilized for proprietary optimization as compared to STF contracts. Proprietary optimization requires us to purchase inventory, which is financed by cash on hand and our credit facilities. A higher cost of capital relative to that of our customers will generally lead to lower volume used for proprietary optimization transactions. In general, higher carrying costs for us or our customers result in lower margins for us. During the 2016 fiscal year, the combination of reductions in natural gas prices, margin amounts required to support our retail marketing operations, unfavorable market conditions and a reduction in our net credit facility availability has prevented us from realizing additional revenues and earnings. Continued reduction in amounts available under the credit facilities may restrict our ability to pursue optimization strategies. The inability to pursue such revenue strategies may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nCustomer Usage Patterns\nIncremental revenue opportunities in the form of STF or proprietary optimization transactions may arise for us if capacity usage by our LTF customers is underutilized or offset by other LTF customers.\nSupply and Demand for Natural Gas\nDuring the past several years, North America has experienced a dramatic increase in the supply of natural gas, principally from the development of unconventional natural gas sources, including shale gas. These increases in supply have been coupled with build-outs of natural gas pipeline capacity in certain areas of the United States, which generally have the effect of increasing deliverability of natural gas to more North American markets and dampening the price differentials for natural gas between geographic markets, including those served by us. We are unable to determine or predict the direct impact on our business from these developments. However, we believe that the market will return to a more balanced level because gas demand is expected to increase in the medium term due to (1) a forecasted increase in base load industrial demand, (2) construction of new gas fired power plants and coal to gas switching (3) increased exports to Mexico, and (4) exports of LNG.\nChanges in the Value of the Canadian Dollar versus the U.S. Dollar\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar. We generate revenues from our Canadian operations in Canadian dollars. Cash inflows from revenues are offset, in part, by natural gas inventory purchases, operating, general and administrative and capital costs that are also transacted in Canadian dollars. The majority of our hedges are transacted in U.S. dollars on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Our financial instruments, principally our Common Units, Senior Notes and credit facilities, are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. We hedge our net exposure to the Canadian dollar by entering into currency hedges for the substantial majority of net exposure for our transactions. We do not hedge our net Canadian dollar exposure for potential future transactions, as the timing and amount of those transactions, which include proprietary optimization purchases and sales, are difficult to predict. During fiscal 2016, the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar did not materially impact\nour results of operations because its impact on revenues has been offset by lower expenses and hedging gains realized during the period.\nInflation\nInflation has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years, it remains a factor in the current economy.\nSegment Information\nOur process for the identification of reportable segments involves examining the nature of services offered, the types of customer contracts entered into and the nature of the economic and regulatory environment. Since our inception, we have operated along functional lines in our commercial, engineering and operations teams for operations in Alberta, northern California and the U.S. midcontinent. All functional lines and facilities offer the same services: fee-based revenue and optimization. All services are delivered using reservoir storage. All facilities have the same types of customers: major companies in the energy industry, industrial, commercial, and local distribution companies and municipal energy consumers. We also have a marketing business which is an extension of our proprietary optimization activities. Proprietary optimization activities occur when we purchase, store and sell natural gas for our own account in order to utilize or optimize storage capacity that is not contracted or available to third party customers. We measure profitability consistently along all functional lines based on revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and unrealized risk management gains and losses. We have aggregated our functional lines and facilities into one reportable segment as at and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nInformation pertaining to our fee-based and proprietary optimization revenues is presented in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015\n\u2022 Revenue. Revenues include fee-based revenue and optimization, net. Fee-based revenue consists of long-term contracts for storage fees that are generated when we provide storage services on a monthly basis and short-term fees associated with specified injections and withdrawals of natural gas. Optimization revenue results from the purchase of natural gas inventory and its forward sale to future periods through energy trading contracts, with our facilities being used to store the inventory between the purchase and sale of the natural gas inventory.\nDetails of our revenue include:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term contract revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>36,263 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>80,781 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>83,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term contract revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,416 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fee-based revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135,356 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized optimization, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,372 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized risk management (losses) gains\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,566 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>31,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,732 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write-downs of inventory\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,300 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(63,800 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,600 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total optimization revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(389 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>5,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>54,345 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>98,319 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>207,396 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in revenue was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u2022 LTF Revenues. Fiscal 2016 LTF revenues declined by $44.5 million (55%) from fiscal 2015. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to a one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million received from TransCanada in fiscal 2015, for which there was no corresponding amounts in fiscal 2016. The remainder of the decrease in revenues largely resulted from lower contract rates that caused revenues to decline by $14.2 million, and lower customer utilization that resulted in a decrease in variable fees of $2.9 million. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates between the Canadian and U.S. dollar decreased revenues by $3.3 million compared to last year. The declines were partially offset by higher allocated capacity of 7.4 Bcf to LTF revenues, resulting in an increase of $1.9 million. The realized margins were $0.37 per Mcf of storage capacity in fiscal 2016 compared to $0.89 per Mcf in fiscal 2015. Excluding the one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million, realized margin would have been $0.60 per Mcf in fiscal 2015.\n\u2022 STF Revenues. STF revenues increased by $6.9 million (60%) compared to fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, we increased the storage capacity allocated to this revenue strategy by 16.5 Bcf. In addition, during the year ended March 31, 2014, certain transactions with lower contract rates were entered into to mitigate withdrawal risk during the winter of fiscal 2014, the effects of which continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The lack of similar transactions in the year ended March 31, 2016 resulted in higher STF revenue when compared to the prior fiscal year. Realized margins were $0.20 per Mcf in fiscal 2016 compared to $0.15 per Mcf in fiscal 2015.\n\u2022 Optimization Revenues. Total optimization revenues, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, along with write-downs of proprietary optimization inventories, decreased to a loss of $0.4 million in fiscal 2016 compared to income of $6.0 million in fiscal 2015. When evaluating the performance of our optimization business, we focus on our realized optimization margins, excluding the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs. For financial reporting purposes, our net optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs, which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period. The components of optimization revenues are as follows:\n\u2022 Realized Optimization Revenues. Net realized optimization revenues decreased by $17.6 million compared to fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, storage capacity allocated to this revenue strategy was reduced by 29.5 Bcf and the average realized margin for optimization activities was $0.37 per Mcf in fiscal 2016 compared to $0.45 per Mcf in fiscal 2015. The profitability realized per Mcf of optimization capacity was reduced in the current year as a result of the suppressed spread environment and a lack of market volatility of natural gas across North American markets during fiscal 2016.\nRealized optimization revenues include revenues from our natural gas marketing operations of $15.3 million and $13.0 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue from the marketing business increased compared to last year as a result of a stronger residential market in Western Canada as well as our commercial market in Eastern Canada.\n\u2022 Unrealized Risk Management (Losses) Gains. Unrealized risk management losses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 were $16.6 million compared to gains of $31.7 million in fiscal 2015. Unrealized losses in fiscal 2016 were due to decreases in the value of financial hedges resulting from decreases in the prices of forward purchase contracts of natural gas. Gains in fiscal 2015 were mainly due to increases in the value of financial hedges resulting from decreases in forward sales price of natural gas relative to our contracts. Unrealized risk management gains and losses from our natural gas marketing operations amounted to losses of $1.9 million and $0.6 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\u2022 Write-Down of Inventory. Natural gas prices fell during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. This reduction increased the value of our economic hedges and decreased the value of the proprietary optimization inventory underlying those hedges. With the realization of hedging gains positioned in the current fiscal year and the positioning of new hedges at lower values in future periods, the estimated market value of our inventories became less than its carrying cost. Accordingly, we wrote down our proprietary inventories by $4.3 million in fiscal 2016 and $63.8 million during fiscal 2015.\n\u2022 Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes. Loss before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was $115.1 million compared to $382.3 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease was attributable to the change in net revenue as discussed above, plus the following:\n\u2022 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses consisted of the following:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease costs and property taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,593 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15,521 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13,945 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel and electricity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,152 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,033 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General operating costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,933 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>29,806 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>39,230 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>40,834 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased by $9.4 million (24%) compared to the prior year. Reductions in operating expenses for fiscal 2016 were principally the result of lower facility utilization which reduced fuel and electricity consumption. Additionally, leased storage capacity was reduced by 5.6 Bcf at April 1, 2015, resulting in a decrease in lease costs. Maintenance costs in the prior period were higher due to heavy equipment usage during the winter of fiscal 2014 resulting in significantly higher equipment repairs throughout fiscal 2015. In addition, a weaker Canadian dollar reduced expenses associated with our Canadian facilities by $1.6 million for 2016.\n\u2022 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consisted of the following:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13,501 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,624 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>26,107 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General costs, including office and IT costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,123 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal, audit and regulatory costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,707 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>29,993 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>26,833 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>39,937 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million (12%) in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Legal, audit and regulatory costs for fiscal 2016 included $4.5 million of expenses related to the Transaction. Excluding the costs associated with the Transaction, total general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 would have been $25.5 million. Compensation costs were higher in fiscal 2016 due to cost recoveries realized in fiscal 2015 as a result of the reversals of prior-year incentive compensation accruals and retention incentive plan accruals related to the Transaction. The increases in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016 were offset by a reduction in costs of $2.8 million resulting from the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\u2022 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased by $59.9 million (51%) compared to the prior year. Depreciation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 included $24.5 million and $64.7 million, respectively, related to migration of cushion gas at our Canadian facilities for our estimated costs associated with proprietary cushion gas that no longer provides effective pressure support. After experiencing unprecedented deliverability requirements in fiscal 2014, an evaluation of facility performance, cycling capabilities, and costs associated with maintaining those capabilities was undertaken in fiscal 2015 determining that 6.2 Bcf of cushion gas had migrated and no longer provided effective cushion support. During fiscal 2016, 2.4 Bcf of cushion gas was estimated to have migrated.\nAmortization of intangible assets during fiscal 2015 included $11.7 million of amortization related to the termination of the prior storage agreement with TransCanada and the establishment of a new contract.\n\u2022 Interest Expense. Interest expense consisted of the following:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on Senior Notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>37,375 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>37,374 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>56,526 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on credit facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,617 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,354 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>818 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>52,301 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>51,336 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>66,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased by $1.0 million (2%) compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Higher average interest rates were partially offset by the impacts of lower average balances of our credit facilities compared to the level of drawings during fiscal 2015.\n\u2022 Impairment of Goodwill. During fiscal 2015, we concluded that a number of factors, including the continued narrow seasonal spread environment, combined with the significant reduction in natural gas price volatility, and a strong decline in our market capitalization were impairment indicators. As a result of this determination, we performed an impairment test and concluded the remaining balance of our goodwill was fully impaired, and therefore an impairment charge of $245.6 million was recorded.\n\u2022 Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit decreased by $19.9 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. This change was primarily due to lower taxable losses as well as an increase in Canadian provincial income tax rate in fiscal 2016 both of which impacted certain Canadian taxable entities.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2014\nThe change in revenue was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u2022 LTF Revenues. Fiscal 2015 LTF revenues declined by $3.2 million (4%) from fiscal 2014. The decrease in revenues resulted from lower fees realized, as well as lower storage capacity allocated to our LTF strategy. During fiscal 2015, lower rates caused revenues to decline by $14.9 million, and allocated capacity being lower by 18.8 Bcf contributed to a decrease of $12.0 million compared to fiscal 2014. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates between the Canadian and U.S. dollar decreased revenues by $2.3 million compared to fiscal 2014. These were partially offset by a one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million received from TransCanada. Realized margins were $0.89 per Mcf of storage capacity in fiscal 2015 compared\nto $0.77 per Mcf in fiscal 2014. Excluding the one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million, realized margin would have been $0.60 per Mcf in fiscal 2015.\n\u2022 STF Revenues. STF revenues decreased by $39.9 million (78%) compared to fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, STF rates were negatively affected by a suppressed spread environment. To a lesser degree, STF revenue was also impacted by certain transactions with lower contract rates that were entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to mitigate withdrawal risk. The effect of these contracts, which continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2015, resulted in lower STF revenue when compared to fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, the amount of capacity utilized for STF contracts increased by 0.7 Bcf. Realized margins were $0.15 per Mcf in fiscal 2015 compared to $0.69 per Mcf in fiscal 2014.\n\u2022 Optimization Revenues. Total optimization revenues, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, along with write-downs of proprietary optimization inventories, decreased from $72.0 million in fiscal 2014 to $6.0 million in fiscal 2015. The components of optimization revenues are as follows:\n\u2022 Realized Optimization Revenues. Net realized optimization revenues decreased by $47.3 million compared to fiscal 2014. The average realized margin for optimization activities was $0.45 per Mcf in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.29 per Mcf in fiscal 2014. The profitability of realized optimization was reduced in fiscal 2015 as a result of the suppressed spread environment and a lack of market volatility. Gains during the fiscal 2014 were driven by higher levels of volatility in North American natural gas markets, which resulted from changes in pipeline pricing in our Canadian markets during the summer and autumn of 2013. In addition, cold winter weather significantly increased demand for natural gas across North American markets in the latter part of 2013 and the first three months of 2014, which created significant opportunities.\nRealized optimization revenues include revenues from our natural gas marketing operations of $13.0 million and $9.7 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue from the marketing business increased as a result of a stronger residential market in Western Canada.\n\u2022 Unrealized Risk Management Gains (Losses). Unrealized risk management gains for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 were $31.7 million compared to losses of $8.7 million in fiscal 2014. Unrealized gains in fiscal 2015 were due to increases in the value of financial hedges resulting from decreases in forward sales price of natural gas relative to our contracts. Losses in fiscal 2014 were due to prices rising after financial hedges were transacted in prior periods. Unrealized risk management gains and losses from our natural gas marketing operations amounted to a loss of $0.6 million and a gain of $0.8 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\u2022 Write-Down of Inventory. Natural gas prices fell during the year ended March 31, 2015. This reduction increased the value of our economic hedges and decreased the value of the proprietary optimization inventory underlying those hedges. With the realization of hedging gains positioned in fiscal 2015 and the positioning of new hedges at lower values in the then future periods, the estimated market value of our inventories became less than its carrying cost. Accordingly, we wrote down our proprietary inventories by $63.8 million during fiscal 2015.\n\u2022 Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes. Loss before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 was $382.3 million compared to a loss before income taxes of $19.2 million in\nfiscal 2014. The increase in loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to lower net revenue as discussed above, plus the following:\n\u2022 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses in fiscal 2015 decreased by $1.6 million (4%) compared to the prior year. Fuel and electricity costs declined by $2.0 million on account of lower average facility utilization, combined with declines in fuel and electricity prices. Salaries and benefits were reduced as a result of lower incentive compensation accruals. These reductions were partially offset by higher lease costs due to leasing additional cushion to manage our temporary pressure support requirements.\n\u2022 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by $13.1 million (33%) in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of lower incentive accruals related to short-and long-term compensation plans.\n\u2022 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2015 increased by $76.0 million (184%) compared to the prior year. The increase reflected provisions for cushion migration totaling $64.7 million related to 6.2 Bcf of proprietary cushion estimated to have migrated at our facilities, and a provision of $11.7 million for amortization of intangible assets related to the termination of a contract with TransCanada.\n\u2022 Interest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2015 decreased by $15.0 million (23%) compared to the year ended March 31, 2014. Interest on our Senior Notes was reduced as a result of a lower interest rate and lower outstanding balances. During fiscal 2015, the Senior Notes consisted of $575.0 million of 6.50% Senior Notes due in 2019. During fiscal 2014, the Senior Notes consisted of $643.8 million of 8.875% Senior Notes, which were redeemed in March 2014. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest on our revolving credit facilities due to higher utilization.\n\u2022 Impairment of Goodwill. During fiscal 2015, we concluded that a number of factors, including the continued narrow seasonal spread environment, combined with the significant reduction in natural gas price volatility, and a strong decline in our market capitalization were impairment indicators. As a result of this determination, we performed an impairment test and concluded the remaining balance of our goodwill was fully impaired, and therefore an impairment charge of $245.6 million was recorded.\n\u2022 Income Tax Expense (Benefit). The income tax benefit in the current year is primarily due to the tax planning strategies undertaken in connection with certain taxable Canadian entities and the recognition of losses in those entities.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\nOur business is highly seasonal. In general, revenue is expected to be highest during our third and fourth fiscal quarters (October through March), during the peak of the natural gas storage winter withdrawal season, when we typically sell most of our optimization inventory to serve the seasonal demand created by the North American residential market which uses natural gas to heat their homes. Revenue is typically lower in the natural gas storage summer months (April through October), when natural gas prices are generally lower and we shift to the storage injection season and replenish our natural gas inventory.\nWe purchase natural gas and build inventories in the summer months. We position sales in the winter months, which results in the peak borrowing under our $320 million Credit Agreement being highest in the middle of our third fiscal quarter, while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in our fourth fiscal quarter. During fiscal 2016, we experienced an unusual storage season when we recognized revenue more evenly throughout the year.\nThe following table illustrates the differences in the recognition of revenue associated with our revenue strategies.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

agreement with TransCanada.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's available liquidity consists of amounts available under its Revolving Credit Facilities and its Short-Term Credit Facility. In February 2016, the Company completed an amendment and extension of its Credit Agreement, which reduced the maximum capacity to $320.0 million and extends the term of the original agreement from June 29, 2016 to September 30, 2016, and allows for an additional term extension to December 31, 2016 provided that the Transaction has closed. However, the Company's FCCR has been below 1.1:1.0 since the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and, as a result, the Company has been unable to utilize the last 15% of availability under the Revolving Credit Facilities without triggering an event of default.\nIn connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Brookfield agreed to lend up to $50.0 million to the Company under a short-term credit facility to be used for working capital purposes. During fiscal 2016, reduced liquidity resulting from lower profitability, and the absence of the last 15% of availability under the Revolving Credit Facilities was partially offset by the funds available under the Short-Term Credit Facility from Brookfield, as well as the liquidation of optimization inventories, and the return of a portion of posted margin deposits associated with the Company's marketing business.\nAs at March 31, 2016, available liquidity totaled $66.8 million, consisting of $56.9 million available under the Revolving Credit Facilities and $9.9 million available under the Short-Term Credit Facility\nfrom Brookfield. At June 6, 2016, available liquidity was $89.2 million, consisting of $79.3 million available under the Revolving Credit Facilities and $9.9 million available under the Short-Term Credit Facility from Brookfield.\nAs we begin fiscal 2017, market conditions for natural gas storage are improving, with widening seasonal spreads. The Company estimates that, based on expected revenues, of which over 80% have already been transacted across all revenue strategies, and expected costs, the Company will generate sufficient cash flow to fund its operations for the next twelve months, except for the repayment of the outstanding balances of the Revolving Credit facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility on their respective maturity dates. Failure to repay the Revolving Credit Facilities when due would also constitute an event of default under the terms of the 6.50% Senior Notes.\nOn June 9, 2016, the CPUC issued a decision which approved the transfer of control of the Wild Goose facility to Brookfield, effective immediately. The Company believes that it is probable that the Merger will be completed on or before July 31, 2016 at which time the Company will pursue replacement financing. Should the merger not close as anticipated, the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facilities on September 30, 2016 would require the Company to seek a further extension of the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay the amounts projected to be outstanding at that time. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to further extend the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay our Revolving Credit Facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility upon maturity.\nSee also \"How We Evaluate Our Operations-Capitalization, Leverage and Liquidity.\"\nHistorical Cash Flows\nIn addition to the underlying profitability of our business, our cash flows are significantly influenced by our level of natural gas inventory, margin deposits and related forward purchase and sale contracts or hedging positions at the end of each accounting period and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. In addition, our period-to-period cash flows are heavily influenced by the seasonality of our proprietary optimization activities. For example, we generally purchase significant quantities of natural gas during the summer months and sell natural gas during the winter months. The storage of natural gas for our own account can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities for the period we pay for and store the natural gas and the subsequent period in which we receive proceeds from the sale of natural gas. When we purchase and store natural gas for our own account, we use cash to pay for the natural gas and record the gas as inventory and thereby reduce our cash flows from operating activities. We typically borrow on our Revolving Credit Facilities to fund these purchases, and these borrowings increase our cash flows from financing activities. Conversely, when we collect the proceeds from the sale of natural gas that we purchased and stored for our own account, the impact on our cash flows from operating activities is positive and the impact on our cash flows from financing activities is negative. Therefore, our cash flows from operating activities fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as we purchase natural gas, store it, and then sell it in a later period. In addition, we have margin requirements on our economically hedged positions. As the cash deposits we make to satisfy our margin requirements increase and decrease with our volume of derivative positions and changes in commodity prices, our cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. The variability in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to (1) changes in market conditions that exist during any given fiscal period, which impacts the margins earned under each of our fee-based and optimization activities; and (2) market conditions at the end of any given fiscal period, which impacts our decision to sell significant volumes of inventory or hold them over a fiscal period end. When we purchase and store natural gas, we borrow under our credit facilities to pay for it, which negatively impacts operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities increases when we collect the cash from the sale of inventories.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $57.3 million compared to cash used in operating activities of $39.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities principally reflects the decision to hold on to a significant volume of inventory at the end of fiscal 2015 and sell that inventory during fiscal 2016. Positive cash flows from operating activities were offset by the lower profitability after non-cash gains, losses and expenses were excluded.\nDuring fiscal 2015, the reduction in cash provided by operating activities was principally related to lower profitability and higher margining requirements associated with our retail business, combined with our decision to hold proprietary inventories over the end of fiscal 2015 in order to sell them in fiscal 2016.\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in non-cash working capital:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Margin deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>19,342 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(14,137 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trade receivables\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(256 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>3,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,383 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued receivables\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,459 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas inventory\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(124,955 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>3,676 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepaid expenses and other assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,421 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,212 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,468 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63,709 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>68,106 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(274 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,249 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(596 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net changes in non-cash working capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>90,854 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(55,835 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15,033 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorking Capital. Working capital is defined as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. Our working capital is affected by the relationship between unrealized risk management hedges which are marked-to-market on a monthly basis, the margin deposits required by our brokers for such gains and losses, proprietary inventory which is stored in our facilities and cash used to fund inventory purchases.\nAs of March 31, 2016 we had a net working capital deficiency of $79.5 million (working capital ratio of 0.7 to 1.0, which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities), compared to a net working capital deficiency of $24.6 million (working capital ratio of 0.9 to 1.0) as at March 31, 2015. The increase in cash flows from changes in working capital principally reflects the decision to hold on to a significant volume of inventory at the end of fiscal 2015 and sell that inventory during fiscal 2016.\nInvesting Activities. Most of the investing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were attributed to maintenance activities. Maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives. A significant drawdown of natural gas inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 resulted in significant operational burdens on our facilities and therefore, required additional maintenance capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 and 2015.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities consists of debt incurred for the acquisition of assets, periodic optional and mandatory retirements of such debt, advances and repayments made on our credit facilities to fund proprietary inventory purchases, and debt retirements and distributions made to our equity holders.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maintenance capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,926 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>4,844 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expansion capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,585 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease (increase) in accrued capital expenditures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,426 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase of customer contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,007 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sale of assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,133 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>7,573 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,166 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives.\nExpansion capital expenditures are investments that serve to increase operating income over the long term through greater capacity or improved efficiency in Niska's operations, whether through construction or acquisition.\nUnder our current plan, we expect to spend approximately $11.0 million to $13.0 million in fiscal 2017 for maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the integrity of our storage facilities and ensure the reliable injection, storage and withdrawal of natural gas for our customers. Included in our estimated maintenance capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 is $6.0 million related to expected cushion gas purchases. Expansion capital for fiscal 2017 is expected to be less than $1.0 million.\nOur 6.50% Senior Notes Due 2019\nWe have senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the \"6.50% Senior Notes\" or \"Notes\") for which interest is payable semi-annually on October 1 and April 1 at a rate of 6.50% per year, and will mature on April 1, 2019. See Note 8 \"-Senior Notes due 2019\" in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nWe are in compliance with all covenant requirements under the 6.50% Senior Notes.\nOur $320 Million Revolving Credit Facilities\nWe have senior secured asset-based revolving credit facilities, consisting of a U.S. and a Canadian revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facilities\", or the \"Credit Agreement\"). These credit facilities in aggregate provide a maximum borrowing capacity of $320.0 million, and can be drawn on up to the lesser of the borrowing base asset or the maximum borrowing capacity. See Note 8 \"-Revolving Credit Facilities\" in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOur most recently calculated borrowing base as of June 6, 2016 was $233.4 million. We also had $100.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facilities and had $19.1 million in letters of credit issued. We are in compliance with all covenant requirements under our Credit Agreement.\nOur $50 Million Short-term Credit Facility\nWe have an agreement with Brookfield for a $50.0 million short term credit facility (the \"Short-term Credit Facility\"), for which borrowings bear interest at an annual rate of 10%. Interest is payable in cash on a quarterly basis, unless the Company elects to pay such interest in-kind by capitalizing accrued interest into the principal amount. See Note 8 \"-Short-term Credit Facility\" in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAs of June 6, 2016, we had $41.1 million in borrowings outstanding under our Short-term Credit Facility and were in compliance with all covenant requirements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes by period the payments due for our estimated contractual obligations as of March 31, 2016:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payment due by period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 - 3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 - 5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long term debt obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>575,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>575,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on long term debt obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,260 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leased storage contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mineral and surface leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173,047 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,565 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Post-retirement obligation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income tax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Withholding taxes (including interest and penalties)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,018,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>629,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>377,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,992,641 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>684,524 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,046,048 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>23,697 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>238,372 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Purchase obligations consisted of forward physical and financial commitments related to future purchases of proprietary natural gas inventory and cushion gas. As we economically hedge substantially all of our natural gas purchases, there are forward sales that offset these commitments which are not included in the above table. As at March 31, 2016, forward physical and financial sales for all future periods related to proprietary gas totaled $994.5 million. As at March 31, 2016, forward financial sales for all future periods relating to cushion gas totaled $7.3 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the future we may use off-balance sheet arrangements such as undrawn credit facility commitments, including letters of credit, to finance portions of our capital and operating needs. See \"-Contractual Obligations\" for more information.\nOn January 1, 2010, we entered into an operating lease for compression and other equipment related to the development of an expansion project at Wild Goose. See \"Note 20-Commitments and Contingencies\" for more information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe historical financial statements included in this document have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires our judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. Our judgments and estimates are based on what we believe are the best and most relevant information available to us at the time our financial statements are prepared.\nThe following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the application of GAAP. These estimates affect, among other items, revenue recognition and expense accruals, migration of cushion, assessing income tax expense including the requirement for a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, calculating unit-based compensation, valuing of risk management assets and liabilities, inventory and identified intangible assets.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue Recognition </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSee Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies.\nRevenues are recognized when collectability is reasonably assured. Collectibility is evaluated on a customer-by-customer basis. New and existing customers are subject to a credit review process, which evaluates the customers' financial position (e.g. cash position and credit rating) and their ability to pay. If collectability is not considered reasonably assured at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with our credit review process, revenue is recognized when the fee is collected. </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOur revenue recognition accounting process contains uncertainties because it requires us to make a judgment on the collectability of revenue at the outset of an arrangement. In addition, our revenue also includes unrealized risk management gains and losses which require us to estimate fair value of our risk management contracts. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFair Value of Risk Management Assets and Liabilities </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWe use natural gas derivatives and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in natural gas prices and foreign exchange rates. These financial assets and liabilities, which are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, are included into one of three categories based on a fair value hierarchy.\nThe fair value of our derivative contracts are recorded as risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as either current assets, non-current assets, or liabilities based upon the anticipated settlement date of the contracts. The determination of the fair value of these derivative contracts reflects the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThere are uncertainties in our methodology in the determination of fair value since it requires us to consider various factors, including over-the-counter quotations, location differentials and closing foreign exchange rates underlying the contracts. Although the fair value of our risk management assets and liabilities may fluctuate, such fluctuations are offset by equivalent changes in the value of our physical inventory. Our policy is for our inventory and purchases to be economically hedged, within small tolerances permitted under our risk management policy, so we are not exposed economically to the risk of fluctuating commodity prices. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInventory </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOur inventory is natural gas injected into storage and held for resale.

These phenomena influence one another and the level of uncertainty of the estimate of cushion present in a reservoir. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nImpairment of Intangible Assets </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSee Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, on our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our policy regarding Intangible assets.\nIntangible assets are reviewed for impairment as impairment indicators arise.

Loss before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was $115.1 million compared to $382.3 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease was attributable to the change in net revenue as discussed above, plus the following:\nOur cost of capital and the amount of our available working capital impacts the amount of capacity utilized for proprietary optimization as compared to STF contracts. Proprietary optimization requires us to purchase inventory, which is financed by cash on hand and our credit facilities. A higher cost of capital relative to that of our customers will generally lead to lower volume used for proprietary optimization transactions. In general, higher carrying costs for us or our customers result in lower margins for us. During the 2016 fiscal year, the combination of reductions in natural gas prices, margin amounts required to support our retail marketing operations, unfavorable market conditions and a reduction in our net credit facility availability has prevented us from realizing additional revenues and earnings. Continued reduction in amounts available under the credit facilities may restrict our ability to pursue optimization strategies. The inability to pursue such revenue strategies may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease costs and property taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,593 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15,521 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13,945 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel and electricity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,152 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,033 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General operating costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,933 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>29,806 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>39,230 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>40,834 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Information\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance Sheet Data (at period end):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>991,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,160,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,539,191 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>772,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>908,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>583,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>584,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>585,926 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total members' equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>554,140 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Data (unaudited):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective working gas capacity (Bcf)(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>244.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capacity added during period (Bcf)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percent of operated capacity contracted to third parties(7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>68.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>76.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOur process for the identification of reportable segments involves examining the nature of services offered, the types of customer contracts entered into and the nature of the economic and regulatory environment. Since our inception, we have operated along functional lines in our commercial, engineering and operations teams for operations in Alberta, northern California and the U.S. midcontinent. All functional lines and facilities offer the same services: fee-based revenue and optimization. All services are delivered using reservoir storage. All facilities have the same types of customers: major companies in the energy industry, industrial, commercial, and local distribution companies and municipal energy consumers. We also have a marketing business which is an extension of our proprietary optimization activities. Proprietary optimization activities occur when we purchase, store and sell natural gas for our own account in order to utilize or optimize storage capacity that is not contracted or available to third party customers. We measure profitability consistently along all functional lines based on revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and unrealized risk management gains and losses. We have aggregated our functional lines and facilities into one reportable segment as at and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13,501 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,624 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>26,107 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General costs, including office and IT costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,123 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal, audit and regulatory costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,707 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>29,993 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>26,833 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>39,937 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Brookfield agreed to lend up to $50.0 million to the Company under a short-term credit facility to be used for working capital purposes. During fiscal 2016, reduced liquidity resulting from lower profitability, and the absence of the last 15% of availability under the Revolving Credit Facilities was partially offset by the funds available under the Short-Term Credit Facility from Brookfield, as well as the liquidation of optimization inventories, and the return of a portion of posted margin deposits associated with the Company's marketing business.\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th>

Facilities\n\u2022 Impairment of Goodwill. During fiscal 2015, we concluded that a number of factors, including the continued narrow seasonal spread environment, combined with the significant reduction in natural gas price volatility, and a strong decline in our market capitalization were impairment indicators. As a result of this determination, we performed an impairment test and concluded the remaining balance of our goodwill was fully impaired, and therefore an impairment charge of $245.6 million was recorded.\nInterest expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased by $1.0 million (2%) compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Higher average interest rates were partially offset by the impacts of lower average balances of our credit facilities compared to the level of drawings during fiscal 2015.\n(1)LTF revenue during the first quarter of 2015 includes a one-time early termination payment of $26.0 million from TransCanada due to the termination of the previous storage agreement with TransCanada.\nTable 22: <table> <tr>

Most of the investing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were attributed to maintenance activities. Maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives. A significant drawdown of natural gas inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 resulted in significant operational burdens on our facilities and therefore, required additional maintenance capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 and 2015.\n <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> Unit-based compensation See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, on our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of policy in accounting for unit-based compensation. The fair value of unit-based awards that are expected to be settled in cash is determined on the date of grant and is re-measured at each reporting period until the settlement date. The fair value at each re-measurement date is equal to the settlement expected to be incurred based on the anticipated number of units vested adjusted for (1) the passage of time and (2) the payout threshold associated with the performance targets which we expect to achieve compared to our established peers. Compensation expense is calculated as the re-measured expected payout less previously-recognized compensation expense. There are uncertainties in our calculation of unit-based compensation since it requires us to make assumptions and judgments on the estimated probabilities of meeting our performance measures, forfeiture rate and unit price at settlement date. The fair value of unit-based awards that are expected to be settled in units is determined on the date of grant and is amortized into equity using the straight-line method over the vesting period. \nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, 2016 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Qtr 1 </th> <th> </th> <th>Qtr 2 </th> <th> </th> <th>Qtr 3 </th> <th> </th> <th>Qtr 4 </th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee-based revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> LTF revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,645 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,928 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,754 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,936 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>36,263 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> STF revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,471 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,734 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized optimization:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized optimization, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,065 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,477 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total realized revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized quarterly revenue as a percentage of total realized annual revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nWe have an agreement with Brookfield for a $50.0 million short term credit facility (the \"Short-term Credit Facility\"), for which borrowings bear interest at an annual rate of 10%.

See Note 8 \"-Short-term Credit Facility\" in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\u2022 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consisted of the following:\n\u2022 LTF Revenues. Fiscal 2016 LTF revenues declined by $44.5 million (55%) from fiscal 2015. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to a one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million received from TransCanada in fiscal 2015, for which there was no corresponding amounts in fiscal 2016. The remainder of the decrease in revenues largely resulted from lower contract rates that caused revenues to decline by $14.2 million, and lower customer utilization that resulted in a decrease in variable fees of $2.9 million. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates between the Canadian and U.S. dollar decreased revenues by $3.3 million compared to last year. The declines were partially offset by higher allocated capacity of 7.4 Bcf to LTF revenues, resulting in an increase of $1.9 million. The realized margins were $0.37 per Mcf of storage capacity in fiscal 2016 compared to $0.89 per Mcf in fiscal 2015. Excluding the one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million, realized margin would have been $0.60 per Mcf in fiscal 2015.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended March 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term contract revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>36,263 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>80,781 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>83,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term contract revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,416 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fee-based revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135,356 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized optimization, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,372 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized risk management (losses) gains\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,566 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>31,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,732 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write-downs of inventory\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,300 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(63,800 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,600 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total optimization revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(389 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>5,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>54,345 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>98,319 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>207,396 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nresulted from numerous factors, including, but not limited to: (i) production curtailments in Alberta due to prolonged compressor outages on the TransCanada Alberta System and high cash prices at PG&A Citygate during injection season; (ii) lower levels of natural gas in storage which led to increased demand in the cash market; (iii) real or perceived changes in overall supply and demand fundamentals; (iv) the development of new pipeline infrastructure connecting new supply to markets; (v) the weather during the first part of winter being milder than normal; and (vi) a material year-over-year increase in natural gas production in the United States as well as in Western Canada during the winter withdrawal season. These market conditions have negatively impacted our revenues during the year ended March 31, 2016 by eroding the prices we can charge for long and short-term firm contracting services, as well as

consolidated assets, liabilities and operations of Niska Gas Storage Partners LLC (\"Niska Partners\" or the \"Company\") as at March 31, 2016 and 2015, and for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The following discussion of the historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and accompanying notes of the Company included elsewhere in this document. In addition, this discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may result in actual results differing from statements we make. See \"Forward-Looking Statements.\" Factors that could cause actual results to differ include those risks and uncertainties that are discussed in \"Risk Factors.\"\n\u2022 Interest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2015 decreased by $15.0 million (23%) compared to the year ended March 31, 2014. Interest on our Senior Notes was reduced as a result of a lower interest rate and lower outstanding balances. During fiscal 2015, the Senior Notes consisted of $575.0 million of 6.50% Senior Notes due in 2019. During fiscal 2014, the Senior Notes consisted of $643.8 million of 8.875% Senior Notes, which were redeemed in March 2014. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest on our revolving credit facilities due to higher utilization.\nVariable Costs\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $57.3 million compared to cash used in operating activities of $39.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities principally reflects the decision to hold on to a significant volume of inventory at the end of fiscal 2015 and sell that inventory during fiscal 2016. Positive cash flows from operating activities were offset by the lower profitability after non-cash gains, losses and expenses were excluded.\nWe have senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the \"6.50% Senior Notes\" or \"Notes\") for which interest is payable semi-annually on October 1 and April 1 at a rate of 6.50% per year, and will mature on April 1, 2019. See Note 8 \"-Senior Notes due 2019\" in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOn June 9, 2016, the CPUC issued a decision which approved the transfer of control of the Wild Goose facility to Brookfield, effective immediately. The Company believes that it is probable that the Merger will be completed on or before July 31, 2016 at which time the Company will pursue replacement financing. Should the merger not close as anticipated, the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facilities on September 30, 2016 would require the Company to seek a further extension of the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay the amounts projected to be outstanding at that time. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain a further extension of the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay our Revolving Credit Facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility upon maturity.\n\u2022 Income Tax Expense (Benefit). The income tax benefit in the current year is primarily due to the tax planning strategies undertaken in connection with certain taxable Canadian entities and the recognition of losses in those entities.\nOverview\n\u2022 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by $13.1 million (33%) in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of lower incentive accruals related to short-and long-term compensation plans.\nIn addition to the underlying profitability of our business, our cash flows are significantly influenced by our level of natural gas inventory, margin deposits and related forward purchase and sale contracts or hedging positions at the end of each accounting period and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. In addition, our period-to-period cash flows are heavily influenced by the seasonality of our proprietary optimization activities. For example, we generally purchase significant quantities of natural gas during the summer months and sell natural gas during the winter months. The storage of natural gas for our own account can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities for the period we pay for and store the natural gas and the subsequent period in which we receive proceeds from the sale of natural gas. When we purchase and store natural gas for our own account, we use cash to pay for the natural gas and record the gas as inventory and thereby reduce our cash flows from operating activities. We typically borrow on our Revolving Credit Facilities to fund these purchases, and these borrowings increase our cash flows from financing activities. Conversely, when we collect the proceeds from the sale of natural gas that we purchased and stored for our own account, the impact on our cash flows from operating activities is positive and the impact on our cash flows from financing activities is negative. Therefore, our cash flows from operating activities fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as we purchase natural gas, store it, and then sell it in a later period. In addition, we have margin requirements on our economically hedged positions. As the cash deposits we make to satisfy our margin requirements increase and decrease with our volume of derivative positions and changes in commodity prices, our cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nSimilarly, Cash Available for Distribution has certain limitations because it accounts for some, but not all, of the above limitations.\n\u2022 Realized Optimization Revenues. Net realized optimization revenues decreased by $17.6 million compared to fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, storage capacity allocated to this revenue strategy was reduced by 29.5 Bcf and the average realized margin for optimization activities was $0.37 per Mcf in fiscal 2016 compared to $0.45 per Mcf in fiscal 2015. The profitability realized per Mcf of optimization capacity was reduced in the current year as a result of the suppressed spread environment and a lack of market volatility of natural gas across North American markets during fiscal 2016.\nWe regularly monitor our credit metrics. Our most important credit metric is our fixed charge coverage ratio, or FCCR, which is contained in the Indenture to our 6.50% Senior Notes and our Credit Agreement. The FCCR measures our Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges, both of which are defined in the Indenture and Credit Agreement. As discussed below, when our FCCR is below 2.0 times, we are restricted in our ability to issue new debt. When our FCCR is below 1.75 times, we are restricted in our ability to pay distributions. When our FCCR is below 1.1 times, we are unable to borrow the last 15% of availability without triggering an event of default. We also monitor our ratio of long-term and total debt to Adjusted EBITDA and our ratio of debt to debt plus equity. While these metrics are not included in our Indenture or Credit Agreement, they are common metrics used to measure the credit-worthiness of companies, including those similar to us.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million (12%) in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Legal, audit and regulatory costs for fiscal 2016 included $4.5 million of expenses related to the Transaction. Excluding the costs associated with the Transaction, total general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 would have been $25.5 million. Compensation costs were higher in fiscal 2016 due to cost recoveries realized in fiscal 2015 as a result of the reversals of prior-year incentive compensation accruals and retention incentive plan accruals related to the Transaction. The increases in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016 were offset by a reduction in costs of $2.8 million resulting from the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\nBackwardation, a condition where the price of natural gas in the near term is higher than the price for future delivery, occurred in the winter of fiscal 2014 and spring of fiscal 2015. This increased our costs to manage our cycling requirements, which include the purchase or lease of natural gas used for temporary pressure support. The cost of temporary pressure support gas was approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2016 (fiscal 2015-$40.0 million). Over the upcoming four years, the expected cumulative cost of temporary pressure support gas is $5.5 million which relates to our commitments to lease certain volumes of natural gas to address our future temporary pressure support needs. In the event that natural gas storage market conditions become more favorable, the cost of managing our operational requirements could be reduced. However, if the conditions deteriorate, the cost of managing our operational requirements will increase.\nMarket conditions for natural gas storage can change rapidly as a result of a number of factors, including weather patterns, overall storage levels across North America in the markets we serve, current and anticipated levels of natural gas supply and demand, and constraints on pipeline infrastructure capacity. Accordingly, current market conditions may not be a reliable predictor of future market conditions. Longer term, we believe several factors may contribute to meaningful growth in North American natural gas demand, including: (i) exports of North American Liquefied Natural Gas; (ii) fuel switching for power generation from coal to natural gas; (iii) construction of new gas-fired power plants; (iv) growing exports to Mexico; and (v) growth in base-load industrial demand, all of which could bolster the demand for, and the commercial value of, natural gas storage. We are unable to predict the timing or magnitude of such events nor can we predict the ultimate impact they may have on our results of operations.\n\nVolume and Fees Derived from Fee-based Contracts\nour results of operations because its impact on revenues has been offset by lower expenses and hedging gains realized during the period.\nAs of June 6, 2016, we had $41.1 million in borrowings outstanding under our Short-term Credit Facility and were in compliance with all covenant requirements.\nOur capital expenditures for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nDuring the past several years, North America has experienced a dramatic increase in the supply of natural gas, principally from the development of unconventional natural gas sources, including shale gas. These increases in supply have been coupled with build-outs of natural gas pipeline capacity in certain areas of the United States, which generally have the effect of increasing deliverability of natural gas to more North American markets and dampening the price differentials for natural gas between geographic markets, including those served by us. We are unable to determine or predict the direct impact on our business from these developments. However, we believe that the market will return to a more balanced level because gas demand is expected to increase in the medium term due to (1) a forecasted increase in base load industrial demand, (2) construction of new gas fired power plants and coal to gas switching (3) increased exports to Mexico, and (4) exports of LNG.\n(7)Excludes NGPL-leased capacity of 2.9 Bcf in fiscal 2016, and 8.5 Bcf in fiscal years prior.\n\u2022 Unrealized Risk Management Gains (Losses). Unrealized risk management gains for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 were $31.7 million compared to losses of $8.7 million in fiscal 2014. Unrealized gains in fiscal 2015 were due to increases in the value of financial hedges resulting from decreases in forward sales price of natural gas relative to our contracts. Losses in fiscal 2014 were due to prices rising after financial hedges were transacted in prior periods. Unrealized risk management gains and losses from our natural gas marketing operations amounted to a loss of $0.6 million and a gain of $0.8 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe combination of reductions in natural gas prices, collateral required to support our retail marketing operations, costs associated with the requirements for temporary reservoir pressure support and unfavorable market conditions which have prevented us from realizing additional revenues and earnings have reduced the liquidity available under our credit facilities. Continued reduction in amounts available under our credit facilities may continue to restrict our ability to pursue optimization strategies. The inability to pursue such revenue strategies may have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenues and profitability.\nThe following table illustrates the differences in the recognition of revenue associated with our revenue strategies.\nRealized optimization revenues include revenues from our natural gas marketing operations of $15.3 million and $13.0 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue from the marketing business increased compared to last year as a result of a stronger residential market in Western Canada as well as our commercial market in Eastern Canada.\nPlease refer to Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCushion migration occurs when hydrocarbons move to an area of the storage reservoir where effective support in cycling a facility's working gas is no longer provided. During the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded charges to depreciation expense of $24.5 million, $64.7 million and $nil, respectively, related to 2.4 Bcf, 6.2 Bcf and nil Bcf of proprietary cushion estimated to have migrated at our Canadian facilities. We currently estimate that ongoing cushion migration could require an annual expenditure of approximately $4.0 million to $6.0 million to replace the cushion gas that has migrated. These estimates include assumptions about storage levels and cycling requirements which can vary significantly depending on operating conditions.\nWe have senior secured asset-based revolving credit facilities, consisting of a U.S. and a Canadian revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facilities\", or the \"Credit Agreement\"). These credit facilities in aggregate provide a maximum borrowing capacity of $320.0 million, and can be drawn on up to the lesser of the borrowing base asset or the maximum borrowing capacity. See Note 8 \"-Revolving Credit Facilities\" in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nCustomer Usage Patterns\nWe monitor both the volume and price of our LTF and STF contracts in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing efforts as well as the relative attractiveness of each of these types of contracts compared to each other as well as in comparison to our optimization strategy. During periods when market values for storage capacity are higher, we typically use more of our capacity under LTF contracts. The fees we are able to generate from our LTF and STF contracts reflect market conditions, including interest rates. The capacity used for STF contracts depends, among other things, on available capacity not reserved under LTF contracts as well as market demand and contract rates available for these services.\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, legal, accounting and tax consulting fees, and our office leases.\nMaintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives.\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution in this report. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution to net earnings (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is shown above.\n\u2022 Write-Down of Inventory. Natural gas prices fell during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. This reduction increased the value of our economic hedges and decreased the value of the proprietary optimization inventory underlying those hedges. With the realization of hedging gains positioned in the current fiscal year and the positioning of new hedges at lower values in future periods, the estimated market value of our inventories became less than its carrying cost. Accordingly, we wrote down our proprietary inventories by $4.3 million in fiscal 2016 and $63.8 million during fiscal 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution\nAs we begin fiscal 2017, market conditions for natural gas storage are improving, with widening seasonal spreads and increasing volatility. The Company estimates that, based on expected revenues, of which over 80% have already been transacted across all revenue strategies, and expected costs, the Company will generate sufficient cash flow to fund its operations for the next twelve months, except for the repayment of the outstanding balances of the Revolving Credit Facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility on their respective maturity dates. Failure to repay the Revolving Credit Facilities when due would also constitute an event of default under the terms of the 6.50% Senior Notes.\n\u2022 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2015 increased by $76.0 million (184%) compared to the prior year. The increase reflected provisions for cushion migration totaling $64.7 million related to 6.2 Bcf of proprietary cushion estimated to have migrated at our facilities, and a provision of $11.7 million for amortization of intangible assets related to the termination of a contract with TransCanada.\nfiscal 2014. The increase in loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to lower net revenue as discussed above, plus the following:\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n(6)Represents operated and NGPL-leased capacity. Effective working gas capacity data is as at March 31 of each year. In April 2015, 5.6 Bcf of leased capacity from NGPL expired, bringing our total NGPL-leased capacity down to 2.9 Bcf.\nfrom Brookfield. At June 6, 2016, available liquidity was $89.2 million, consisting of $79.3 million available under the Revolving Credit Facilities and $9.9 million available under the Short-Term Credit Facility from Brookfield.\nFunding the purchase of proprietary optimization inventory can consume a significant portion of our available working capital. Accordingly, we closely monitor the utilization and remaining available capacity under our credit facilities and actively pursue additional short-term firm contracts when we determine it is appropriate to maintain liquidity.\nUnder our current plan, we expect to spend approximately $11.0 million to $13.0 million in fiscal 2017 for maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the integrity of our storage facilities and ensure the reliable injection, storage and withdrawal of natural gas for our customers. Included in our estimated maintenance capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 is $6.0 million related to expected cushion gas purchases. Expansion capital for fiscal 2017 is expected to be less than $1.0 million.\nOur 6.50% Senior Notes Due 2019\n <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> Fair Value of Risk Management Assets and Liabilities We use natural gas derivatives and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in natural gas prices and foreign exchange rates. These financial assets and liabilities, which are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, are included into one of three categories based on a fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our derivative contracts are recorded as risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as either current assets, non-current assets, or liabilities based upon the anticipated settlement date of the contracts. The determination of the fair value of these derivative contracts reflects the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are uncertainties in our methodology in the determination of fair value since it requires us to consider various factors, including over-the-counter quotations, location differentials and closing foreign exchange rates underlying the contracts. Although the fair value of our risk management assets and liabilities may fluctuate, such fluctuations are offset by equivalent changes in the value of our physical inventory. Our policy is for our inventory and purchases to be economically hedged, within small tolerances permitted under our risk management policy, so we are not exposed economically to the risk of fluctuating commodity prices. Inventory Our inventory is natural gas injected into storage and held for resale. Inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market. Adjustments to write down the costs of inventory to market are recorded as an offset to optimization revenues while costs to store the gas are recognized as operating expenses in the period the costs are incurred. At the end of each reporting period we determine whether a write-down is required to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market value. This determination has built-in uncertainties since it requires judgment in estimating fair market values in the periods to which our inventory is economically hedged and the level of a normal margin compared to selling price in those periods. Cushion Effectiveness Certain volumes of cushion are required for maintaining a minimum field pressure. Cushion is considered a component of the facility and as such is not depreciated. Cushion is monitored to ensure that it provides effective pressure support. In the event that natural gas moves to another area of the reservoir where it does not provide effective pressure support, charges against cushion are included in depreciation in an amount equal to the cost of estimated volumes that have migrated. Cushion requirements and its effectiveness are estimated using pressure and volumetric data accumulated over many years of storage operation. The data is added into a complex reservoir model which accounts for different dynamic phenomena occurring within the reservoir. The information incorporated into the model includes pressure gradients within the reservoir, water encroachment due to an active aquifer, tight reservoir components which slowly capture and release back some of the gas stored and a cushion migration component. These phenomena influence one another and the level of uncertainty of the estimate of cushion present in a reservoir. \nA summary of financial and operating data for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\u2022 the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and make distributions to our equity holders;\nin the early summer (instead of a steady rate of injections throughout the summer), we would have higher costs in our first quarter and lower than expected costs in the second quarter. A mild winter could lead to less withdrawals in total, and therefore lower overall fuel and power costs because less injections would occur in filling our storage facilities. These cost variances could be partially offset by similar variances in long-term contract revenues. During the year ended March 31, 2016, operating expenses were lower than the year ended March 31, 2015, principally due to lower facility utilization, and lower average fuel and electricity prices.\nSee also \"How We Evaluate Our Operations-Capitalization, Leverage and Liquidity\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar. We generate revenues from our Canadian operations in Canadian dollars. Cash inflows from revenues are offset, in part, by natural gas inventory purchases, operating, general and administrative and capital costs that are also transacted in Canadian dollars. The majority of our hedges are transacted in U.S. dollars on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Our financial instruments, principally our Common Units, Senior Notes and credit facilities, are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. We hedge our net exposure to the Canadian dollar by entering into currency hedges for the substantial majority of net exposure for our transactions. We do not hedge our net Canadian dollar exposure for potential future transactions, as the timing and amount of those transactions, which include proprietary optimization purchases and sales, are difficult to predict. During fiscal 2016, the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar did not materially impact\nIn June 2015, the Company, the Manager, Holdco and certain of their affiliates entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Brookfield. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Brookfield will acquire all of the Company's outstanding common units for $4.225 per common unit in cash and will acquire the Managing Member and the IDRs in the Company prior to June 14, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2016 we had a net working capital deficiency of $79.5 million (working capital ratio of 0.7 to 1.0, which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities), compared to a net working capital deficiency of $24.6 million (working capital ratio of 0.9 to 1.0) as at March 31, 2015. The increase in cash flows from changes in working capital principally reflects the decision to hold on to a significant volume of inventory at the end of fiscal 2015 and sell that inventory during fiscal 2016.\nAt times, if spreads move favorably, such as if winter gas prices fall below forward prices for the following summer, we can further increase margins that have been substantially locked in by choosing to hold inventory into a subsequent period and re-hedging the transaction. This has the result of increasing our cash flow margins and overall profitability although for accounting purposes the income is recognized in a later period, causing cyclicality in our reported revenues and profits.\nThe change in revenue was primarily attributable to the following:\nWhen evaluating the performance of our optimization business, we focus on our realized optimization margins, excluding the impact of unrealized hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs. For accounting purposes, our realized optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs, which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period. However, because substantially all inventory is economically hedged, any inventory write-downs are offset by hedging gains and any unrealized hedging losses are offset by gains when the inventory is sold. These offsetting gains and losses may occur in different periods.\nIn connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Brookfield agreed to lend up to $50.0 million to the Company under a short-term credit facility to be used for working capital purposes. During fiscal 2016, reduced liquidity due to lower profitability was partially offset by the funds available under the Short-Term Credit Facility. As at March 31, 2016, the balance under the Short-term Credit Facility was $40.1 million, and the Company had $66.8 million of total available liquidity, compared to $80.1 million at March 31, 2015.\n\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue through long- and short-term contracts for the storage of natural gas for third-party customers and the proprietary optimization of storage capacity that is\nCapital Expenditures\nThe GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution is net earnings. The non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution should not be considered as alternatives to net earnings (loss). Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and have important limitations as analytical tools. Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor Cash Available for Distribution should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings (loss) and are defined differently by different companies, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nOur most significant variable operating expenses are fuel and electricity costs. These operating expenses vary significantly based upon the amount of natural gas we inject or withdraw throughout the year and the price of the energy commodity at the time of purchase. Variable operating expenses are partially offset by the variable fees we collect from our LTF contracts. The fixed component of our operating expenses include salaries and labor, parts and supplies, surface and mineral lease rentals and other general operating costs. These fixed operating expenses are more stable from year to year but can fluctuate due to unforeseen repairs.\n\u2022 operating, general and administrative expenses;\n\n\nWe purchase natural gas and build inventories in the summer months. We position sales in the winter months, which results in the peak borrowing under our $320 million Credit Agreement being highest in the middle of our third fiscal quarter, while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in our fourth fiscal quarter. During fiscal 2016, we experienced an unusual storage season when we recognized revenue more evenly throughout the year.\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2016, the difference between summer and winter prices in the natural gas futures market, referred to as the seasonal spread, remained extremely narrow. This condition\n\u2022 Write-Down of Inventory. Natural gas prices fell during the year ended March 31, 2015. This reduction increased the value of our economic hedges and decreased the value of the proprietary optimization inventory underlying those hedges. With the realization of hedging gains positioned in fiscal 2015 and the positioning of new hedges at lower values in the then future periods, the estimated market value of our inventories became less than its carrying cost. Accordingly, we wrote down our proprietary inventories by $63.8 million during fiscal 2015.\nChanges in working gas capacity are expected to impact the level of our revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, our contract for 5.6 Bcf of the 8.5 Bcf leased capacity on NGPL expired thereby reducing our gas storage capacity to approximately 244.9 Bcf . On May 1, 2016, 1.0 Bcf of the remaining 2.9 Bcf leased capacity on NGPL expired, thereby reducing our gas storage capacity to approximately 243.9 Bcf. We do not expect these changes will cause a significant reduction to future earnings.\nThe closing of the Transaction is dependent on the satisfaction of certain conditions related to regulatory requirements, including the approval of the CPUC. On May 12, 2016, the CPUC issued a Proposed Decision, which if finally approved will allow the transfer of control of Wild Goose to Brookfield and also allow the Transaction to proceed to close in accordance with the Merger Agreement. The Proposed Decision can still be amended prior to being voted on by the CPUC and may or may not be approved by the CPUC.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2010, we entered into an operating lease for compression and other equipment related to the development of an expansion project at Wild Goose. See \"Note 20-Commitments and Contingencies\" for more information.\nInflation has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years, it remains a factor in the current economy.\nAs we begin fiscal 2017, market conditions for natural gas storage are improving, with widening seasonal spreads. The Company estimates that, based on expected revenues, of which over 80% have already been transacted across all revenue strategies, and expected costs, the Company will generate sufficient cash flow to fund its operations for the next twelve months, except for the repayment of the outstanding balances of the Revolving Credit facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility on their respective maturity dates. Failure to repay the Revolving Credit Facilities when due would also constitute an event of default under the terms of the 6.50% Senior Notes.\nfinancial measures by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as commercial banks and ratings agencies, to assess:\nDuring fiscal 2015, the reduction in cash provided by operating activities was principally related to lower profitability and higher margining requirements associated with our retail business, combined with our decision to hold proprietary inventories over the end of fiscal 2015 in order to sell them in fiscal 2016.\nVolume and Margin Derived from Our Proprietary Optimization Activities\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and impacts our ability to generate profits and cash flows. Therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense may have material limitations;\n\u2022 Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes. Loss before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 was $382.3 million compared to a loss before income taxes of $19.2 million in\n(2)Loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended March 31, 2014 relates to the redemption of our 8.875% Senior Notes due 2018 in March 2014. The loss consisted of a call premium of $28.6 million along with the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of the 8.875% Senior Notes in 2010.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities consists of debt incurred for the acquisition of assets, periodic optional and mandatory retirements of such debt, advances and repayments made on our credit facilities to fund proprietary inventory purchases, and debt retirements and distributions made to our equity holders.\nIn addition, our storage facilities may require additional natural gas to provide temporary pressure support during periods of high activity to meet cycling requirements and performance demands related to our gas in storage. These volumes fluctuate from year to year along with our cycling requirements. These cycling requirements are managed through a combination of strategies which are adapted to changes in natural gas market conditions. Typically, the use of gas to provide temporary pressure support results in net revenue gains because the cost to acquire natural gas in the nearer term is lower than the price of natural gas for future delivery.\nOperating expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased by $9.4 million (24%) compared to the prior year. Reductions in operating expenses for fiscal 2016 were principally the result of lower facility utilization which reduced fuel and electricity consumption. Additionally, leased storage capacity was reduced by 5.6 Bcf at April 1, 2015, resulting in a decrease in lease costs. Maintenance costs in the prior period were higher due to heavy equipment usage during the winter of fiscal 2014 resulting in significantly higher equipment repairs throughout fiscal 2015. In addition, a weaker Canadian dollar reduced expenses associated with our Canadian facilities by $1.6 million for 2016.\noptimization was driven by a reduction in capacity allocated to the strategy in the current period, offset by an increased allocation to fee-based transactions.\n\n\u2022 volume and margin derived from our proprietary optimization activities;\nOur business is highly seasonal. In general, revenue is expected to be highest during our third and fourth fiscal quarters (October through March), during the peak of the natural gas storage winter withdrawal season, when we typically sell most of our optimization inventory to serve the seasonal demand created by the North American residential market which uses natural gas to heat their homes. Revenue is typically lower in the natural gas storage summer months (April through October), when natural gas prices are generally lower and we shift to the storage injection season and replenish our natural gas inventory.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe Company's available liquidity consists of amounts available under its Revolving Credit Facilities and its Short-Term Credit Facility. In February 2016, the Company completed an amendment and extension of its Credit Agreement, which reduced the maximum capacity to $320.0 million and extends the term of the original agreement from June 29, 2016 to September 30, 2016 and allows for an additional term extension to December 31, 2016 providing that the Transaction has closed. The Company's fixed charge coverage ratio (\"FCCR\") has been below 1.1:1.0 since the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and as a result the Company continued to be unable to borrow the last 15% of availability under the Revolving Credit Facilities without triggering an event of default.\nWe operate the AECO HubTM, which consists of the Countess and Suffield gas storage facilities in Alberta, Canada, and the Wild Goose and Salt Plains gas storage facilities in California and Oklahoma, respectively. Niska Partners markets gas storage services of working gas capacity in addition to optimizing storage capacity with its own proprietary gas purchases at each of these facilities. We also operate a natural gas marketing business which is an extension of our propriety optimization activities in Canada. The Company has a total of 243.9 Bcf of working gas capacity among its facilities, including 1.9 Bcf leased from a third-party pipeline company.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\nuncontracted, underutilized or available only on a short-term basis. We evaluate our business on the basis of the following key measures:\nSupply and Demand for Natural Gas\n\n\u2022 Revenue. Revenues include fee-based revenue and optimization, net. Fee-based revenue consists of long-term contracts for storage fees that are generated when we provide storage services on a monthly basis and short-term fees associated with specified injections and withdrawals of natural gas. Optimization revenue results from the purchase of natural gas inventory and its forward sale to future periods through energy trading contracts, with our facilities being used to store the inventory between the purchase and sale of the natural gas inventory.\n\u2022 volume and fees derived from fee-based contracts;\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe earn revenues by providing natural gas storage services on a long-term firm (\"LTF\") contract basis for which we receive monthly reservation fees for fixed amounts of storage, providing storage services on a short-term firm (\"STF\") contract basis, where a customer pays a fixed fee to inject a specified quantity of natural gas on a specified date or dates and a fixed fee to withdraw on a specified future date or dates, and optimization, where we purchase and sell gas on an economically hedged basis in order to improve facility utilization at margins that can be higher than those from third-party contracts. Proprietary optimization activities occur when the Company purchases and sells natural gas for its own account. Our revenues related to our marketing business are included in proprietary optimization activities. We have aggregated all of our activities in one reportable operating segment for financial reporting purposes. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\u2022 the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015\nCapitalization, Leverage and Liquidity\n(1)Purchase obligations consisted of forward physical and financial commitments related to future purchases of proprietary natural gas inventory and cushion gas. As we economically hedge substantially all of our natural gas purchases, there are forward sales that offset these commitments which are not included in the above table. As at March 31, 2016, forward physical and financial sales for all future periods related to proprietary gas totaled $994.5 million. As at March 31, 2016, forward financial sales for all future periods relating to cushion gas totaled $7.3 million.\nSee also \"How We Evaluate Our Operations-Capitalization, Leverage and Liquidity.\"\nThe fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 reflected a continuation of difficult market conditions for Niska. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $17.1 million, compared to $66.7 million in fiscal 2015 and $140.0 million in fiscal 2014. Included in the fiscal 2016 amounts are benefits of inventory write-downs of $45.2 million. Fiscal 2015 included a one-time contract termination settlement with our largest customer of $26.0 million and benefits from inventory write-downs of $23.1 million. Excluding these amounts, Adjusted EBITDA would have been negative $28.1 million for fiscal 2016 and positive $17.6 million for fiscal 2015. The unfavorable financial results in fiscal 2016 resulted from extraordinarily low seasonal spreads which substantially reduced the value of our storage\nIn addition, in fiscal 2016 and 2015 the Company recorded non-cash charges of additional depreciation of $24.5 million and $64.7 million respectively, associated with migration of cushion gas at its Canadian-based facilities. The combination of poor market conditions and non-cash charges resulted in a net loss for the fiscal 2016 of $103.3 million, compared to fiscal 2015 net loss of $350.7 million.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not include provision for income taxes. Because the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our costs, any measure that excludes income tax expense may have material limitations;\nInflation\nIncremental revenue opportunities in the form of STF or proprietary optimization transactions may arise for us if capacity usage by our LTF customers is underutilized or offset by other LTF customers.\n(5)Long-term debt includes long-term obligations under capital lease, but excludes credit facility drawings which are recorded in current liabilities.\nWhen market conditions warrant, we enter into economically hedged transactions with available capacity. This can achieve higher margins than can be obtained from third-party contracts. Because we economically hedge our transactions, we are able to determine in advance the minimum margins that will be realized and add incremental margins by re-hedging as market conditions change.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, unrealized risk management gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, foreign exchange gains and losses, write-downs of inventory, gains and losses on asset dispositions, non-cash compensation, asset impairments and other income. We believe the adjustments for other income are similar in nature to the traditional adjustments to net earnings used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and adjustment for these items results in an appropriate representation of this financial measure. Cash Available for Distribution is defined as Adjusted EBITDA reduced by interest expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), income taxes paid, maintenance capital expenditures and other income. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution are used as supplemental\nHistorical Cash Flows\nCushion Migration and Pressure Support\nAmortization of intangible assets during fiscal 2015 included $11.7 million of amortization related to the termination of the prior storage agreement with TransCanada and the establishment of a new contract.\nRealized optimization revenues include revenues from our natural gas marketing operations of $13.0 million and $9.7 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue from the marketing business increased as a result of a stronger residential market in Western Canada.\nFactors that impact the performance of specific components of our business from period to period include the following:\nIn the future we may use off-balance sheet arrangements such as undrawn credit facility commitments, including letters of credit, to finance portions of our capital and operating needs. See \"-Contractual Obligations\" for more information.\nWe also provide fee-based services under short-term firm (STF) contracts, where a customer pays a fixed fee to inject a specified quantity of gas on a specified date or dates and to withdraw on a specified future date or dates.\nWhen winter gas prices fall below forward prices for the following summer we may defer the withdrawal of proprietary optimization inventory until the next fiscal year in order to reduce operating costs and add incremental margin and economic value, independent of the period in which that revenue is earned. This may result in the deferral of realized earnings and cash flow from one fiscal year to the next. This was evident during the year ended March 31, 2015, when increased gas supply in the United States resulted in a reduction in the demand for natural gas in storage and resulted in an overall decline in near-term natural gas prices. Due to the contango position of the forward market, we deferred the withdrawal of proprietary optimization inventory until fiscal 2016. As a result, proprietary optimization inventory at March 31, 2015 was relatively high at approximately 48 MDth, as compared to March 31, 2016 proprietary inventory levels of 26 MDth. The year over year decrease in proprietary\nOn June 9, 2016, the CPUC issued a decision which approved the transfer of control of the Wild Goose facility to Brookfield, effective immediately. The Company believes that it is probable that the Merger will be completed on or before July 31, 2016 at which time the Company will pursue replacement financing. Should the merger not close as anticipated, the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facilities on September 30, 2016 would require the Company to seek a further extension of the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay the amounts projected to be outstanding at that time. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to further extend the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay our Revolving Credit Facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility upon maturity.\n\u2022 Optimization Revenues. Total optimization revenues, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, along with write-downs of proprietary optimization inventories, decreased to a loss of $0.4 million in fiscal 2016 compared to income of $6.0 million in fiscal 2015. When evaluating the performance of our optimization business, we focus on our realized optimization margins, excluding the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs. For financial reporting purposes, our net optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs, which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period. The components of optimization revenues are as follows:\nOperating Expenses\nInformation pertaining to our fee-based and proprietary optimization revenues is presented in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).\n\n\u2022 Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit decreased by $19.9 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. This change was primarily due to lower taxable losses as well as an increase in Canadian provincial income tax rate in fiscal 2016 both of which impacted certain Canadian taxable entities.\nWe recognize that the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as an evaluative tool may have certain limitations, including:\nThe following table summarizes by period the payments due for our estimated contractual obligations as of March 31, 2016:\n\u2022 Interest Expense. Interest expense consisted of the following:\nFactors that Impact Our Business\nOur $50 Million Short-term Credit Facility\nMaterial Agreements\n\u2022 repeatable operating performance that is not distorted by non-recurring items or market volatility; and\n\u2022 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses in fiscal 2015 decreased by $1.6 million (4%) compared to the prior year. Fuel and electricity costs declined by $2.0 million on account of lower average facility utilization, combined with declines in fuel and electricity prices. Salaries and benefits were reduced as a result of lower incentive compensation accruals. These reductions were partially offset by higher lease costs due to leasing additional cushion to manage our temporary pressure support requirements.\nThe following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the application of GAAP. These estimates affect, among other items, revenue recognition and expense accruals, migration of cushion, assessing income tax expense including the requirement for a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, calculating unit-based compensation, valuing of risk management assets and liabilities, inventory and identified intangible assets.\nExpansion capital expenditures are investments that serve to increase operating income over the long term through greater capacity or improved efficiency in Niska's operations, whether through construction or acquisition.\n\u2022 LTF Revenues. Fiscal 2015 LTF revenues declined by $3.2 million (4%) from fiscal 2014. The decrease in revenues resulted from lower fees realized, as well as lower storage capacity allocated to our LTF strategy. During fiscal 2015, lower rates caused revenues to decline by $14.9 million, and allocated capacity being lower by 18.8 Bcf contributed to a decrease of $12.0 million compared to fiscal 2014. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates between the Canadian and U.S. dollar decreased revenues by $2.3 million compared to fiscal 2014. These were partially offset by a one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million received from TransCanada. Realized margins were $0.89 per Mcf of storage capacity in fiscal 2015 compared\nThe following table sets forth average volume utilized by, and revenue and fees/margins derived from LTF contracts, STF contracts and proprietary optimization transactions for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2016:\nWorking Gas Storage Capacity\n\u2022 STF Revenues. STF revenues decreased by $39.9 million (78%) compared to fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, STF rates were negatively affected by a suppressed spread environment. To a lesser degree, STF revenue was also impacted by certain transactions with lower contract rates that were entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to mitigate withdrawal risk. The effect of these contracts, which continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2015, resulted in lower STF revenue when compared to fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, the amount of capacity utilized for STF contracts increased by 0.7 Bcf. Realized margins were $0.15 per Mcf in fiscal 2015 compared to $0.69 per Mcf in fiscal 2014.\nCarried Inventory\n\n\u2022 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses consisted of the following:\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\n\u2022 STF Revenues. STF revenues increased by $6.9 million (60%) compared to fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, we increased the storage capacity allocated to this revenue strategy by 16.5 Bcf. In addition, during the year ended March 31, 2014, certain transactions with lower contract rates were entered into to mitigate withdrawal risk during the winter of fiscal 2014, the effects of which continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The lack of similar transactions in the year ended March 31, 2016 resulted in higher STF revenue when compared to the prior fiscal year. Realized margins were $0.20 per Mcf in fiscal 2016 compared to $0.15 per Mcf in fiscal 2015.\n <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> Impairment of Intangible Assets See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, on our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our policy regarding Intangible assets. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as impairment indicators arise. When such events or circumstances are present, the recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows. In the event that the sum of the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate future cash flows, the profitability of future business strategies, industry conditions and other economic factors. Income taxes We are not a taxable entity in the United States. Income taxes are the responsibility of the individual partners and have accordingly not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. We have corporate subsidiaries, which are taxable corporations subject to Canadian federal and provincial income taxes, which are included in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of policy in accounting for income taxes. Our accounting for income taxes has inherent uncertainties since it requires us to estimate the timing of the realization of our tax assets and liabilities, including the allocation of income among different entities and tax jurisdiction, and also requires us to make assumptions on the estimated probabilities of utilization of deferred tax assets and on the determination of tax exposures associated with our tax filing positions. \nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2014\nCarrying Costs and Availability of Liquidity\nWe are in compliance with all covenant requirements under the 6.50% Senior Notes.\n\u2022 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased by $59.9 million (51%) compared to the prior year. Depreciation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 included $24.5 million and $64.7 million, respectively, related to migration of cushion gas at our Canadian facilities for our estimated costs associated with proprietary cushion gas that no longer provides effective pressure support. After experiencing unprecedented deliverability requirements in fiscal 2014, an evaluation of facility performance, cycling capabilities, and costs associated with maintaining those capabilities was undertaken in fiscal 2015 determining that 6.2 Bcf of cushion gas had migrated and no longer provided effective cushion support. During fiscal 2016, 2.4 Bcf of cushion gas was estimated to have migrated.\nDetails of our revenue include:\nIn May 2014, we entered into a new contract with TransCanada, our largest volumetric customer. This new contract replaced a previous storage agreement which provided TransCanada with approximately 40 Bcf of storage capacity at our AECO facilities and had a term that extended to 2030. Under the previous storage agreement both parties had the option to terminate at the end of defined five-year intervals, including April 1, 2015. TransCanada elected to terminate this agreement and entered into a new agreement with us which extends until 2020. The new agreement provides TransCanada with an initial storage capacity of approximately 40 Bcf which will be reduced to approximately 20 Bcf on April 1, 2017. By exercising its early termination rights, TransCanada was obligated to make an early termination payment to us of $26.0 million. This payment was recognized in long-term firm revenue in fiscal 2015. The new rate under the renegotiated contract is lower than the rate previously in effect in prior fiscal periods, resulting in a decrease to LTF revenues in fiscal 2016.\n(1)Optimization revenue is presented net of cost of goods sold. Net optimization revenues include unrealized risk management gains/losses and write-downs of inventory. We had unrealized risk management losses of $16.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, unrealized risk management gains of $31.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, and unrealized risk management losses of $8.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2014. We had write-downs of inventory of $4.3 million, $63.8 million and $4.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding these non-cash items, which do not affect Adjusted EBITDA, our realized optimization revenues were $20.5 million, $38.1 million and $85.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nservices, and reduced price volatility resulting from increased gas supply in the market which, in turn, reduced our ability to capture additional value based on changes in natural gas prices.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA;\n <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> Revenue Recognition See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. Revenues are recognized when collectability is reasonably assured. Collectibility is evaluated on a customer-by-customer basis. New and existing customers are subject to a credit review process, which evaluates the customers' financial position (e.g. cash position and credit rating) and their ability to pay. If collectability is not considered reasonably assured at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with our credit review process, revenue is recognized when the fee is collected. Our revenue recognition accounting process contains uncertainties because it requires us to make a judgment on the collectability of revenue at the outset of an arrangement. In addition, our revenue also includes unrealized risk management gains and losses which require us to estimate fair value of our risk management contracts. \n\u2022 borrowing base revolver availability, liquidity, and compliance with debt covenants.\n(3)Goodwill impairment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 relates to goodwill in two subsidiaries that was determined to be fully impaired and, therefore, an impairment charge of $245.6 million was recorded.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\n(4)Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution in fiscal 2016 include the benefits of inventory write-downs related to inventory impairments of $45.2 million (fiscal 2015-$23.1 million; fiscal 2014-$2.4 million). Excluding these benefits, Adjusted EBITDA would have been negative $28.1 million for fiscal 2016 (fiscal 2015-$43.6 million; fiscal 2014-$137.6 million) and Cash Available for Distribution would have been negative $81.2 million for fiscal 2016 (fiscal 2015-negative $9.0 million; fiscal 2014-$72.6 million).\nThe variable operating costs of our facilities are primarily comprised of costs associated with natural gas and electricity for compressor operations. Our operating costs are affected by the amount and price of energy used to inject and withdraw natural gas from our facilities and by the number and timing of gas injections and withdrawals. For example, if we experience large injections of natural gas\n\u2022 Unrealized Risk Management (Losses) Gains. Unrealized risk management losses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 were $16.6 million compared to gains of $31.7 million in fiscal 2015. Unrealized losses in fiscal 2016 were due to decreases in the value of financial hedges resulting from decreases in the prices of forward purchase contracts of natural gas. Gains in fiscal 2015 were mainly due to increases in the value of financial hedges resulting from decreases in forward sales price of natural gas relative to our contracts. Unrealized risk management gains and losses from our natural gas marketing operations amounted to losses of $1.9 million and $0.6 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWorking Capital. Working capital is defined as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. Our working capital is affected by the relationship between unrealized risk management hedges which are marked-to-market on a monthly basis, the margin deposits required by our brokers for such gains and losses, proprietary inventory which is stored in our facilities and cash used to fund inventory purchases.\nThe Company's available liquidity consists of amounts available under its Revolving Credit Facilities and its Short-Term Credit Facility. In February 2016, the Company completed an amendment and extension of its Credit Agreement, which reduced the maximum capacity to $320.0 million and extends the term of the original agreement from June 29, 2016 to September 30, 2016, and allows for an additional term extension to December 31, 2016 provided that the Transaction has closed. However, the Company's FCCR has been below 1.1:1.0 since the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and, as a result, the Company has been unable to utilize the last 15% of availability under the Revolving Credit Facilities without triggering an event of default.\nContractual Obligations\nWe provide fee-based natural gas storage services to our customers under long-term firm (LTF) and short-term firm (STF) contracts. When a customer enters into a LTF contract, the customer is obligated to pay us monthly reservation fees for a fixed amount of storage which is usable by the customer at their option subject to contractual limits. These fees are fixed regardless of the actual use by the customer, and we also collect a variable fee when the services are actually used in order to allow us to recover our variable operating costs. The volume-weighted average life of our LTF contracts at March 31, 2016 was 2.6 years. Reservation fees comprise over 90% of the revenue generated under LTF contracts and provide a baseline of revenue to support our operating and general and administrative costs.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation and amortization expense. Because we use capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits. Therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense may have material limitations;\nOur most recently calculated borrowing base as of June 6, 2016 was $233.4 million. We also had $100.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facilities and had $19.1 million in letters of credit issued. We are in compliance with all covenant requirements under our Credit Agreement.\nOperating Activities. The variability in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to (1) changes in market conditions that exist during any given fiscal period, which impacts the margins earned under each of our fee-based and optimization activities; and (2) market conditions at the end of any given fiscal period, which impacts our decision to sell significant volumes of inventory or hold them over a fiscal period end. When we purchase and store natural gas, we borrow under our credit facilities to pay for it, which negatively impacts operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities increases when we collect the cash from the sale of inventories.\n\u2022 Realized Optimization Revenues. Net realized optimization revenues decreased by $47.3 million compared to fiscal 2014. The average realized margin for optimization activities was $0.45 per Mcf in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.29 per Mcf in fiscal 2014. The profitability of realized optimization was reduced in fiscal 2015 as a result of the suppressed spread environment and a lack of market volatility. Gains during the fiscal 2014 were driven by higher levels of volatility in North American natural gas markets, which resulted from changes in pipeline pricing in our Canadian markets during the summer and autumn of 2013. In addition, cold winter weather significantly increased demand for natural gas across North American markets in the latter part of 2013 and the first three months of 2014, which created significant opportunities.\n\u2022 Optimization Revenues. Total optimization revenues, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, along with write-downs of proprietary optimization inventories, decreased from $72.0 million in fiscal 2014 to $6.0 million in fiscal 2015. The components of optimization revenues are as follows:\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not allow us to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non-recurring items that materially affect our net earnings or loss.", "item_7_text": "\u2022 the financial performance of our assets, operations and return on capital without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;\n\u2022 Impairment of Goodwill. During fiscal 2015, we concluded that a number of factors, including the continued narrow seasonal spread environment, combined with the significant reduction in natural gas price volatility, and a strong decline in our market capitalization were impairment indicators. As a result of this determination, we performed an impairment test and concluded the remaining balance of our goodwill was fully impaired, and therefore an impairment charge of $245.6 million was recorded.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nto $0.77 per Mcf in fiscal 2014. Excluding the one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million, realized margin would have been $0.60 per Mcf in fiscal 2015.\n\u2022 Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes. Loss before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was $115.1 million compared to $382.3 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease was attributable to the change in net revenue as discussed above, plus the following:\nOur cost of capital and the amount of our available working capital impacts the amount of capacity utilized for proprietary optimization as compared to STF contracts. Proprietary optimization requires us to purchase inventory, which is financed by cash on hand and our credit facilities. A higher cost of capital relative to that of our customers will generally lead to lower volume used for proprietary optimization transactions. In general, higher carrying costs for us or our customers result in lower margins for us. During the 2016 fiscal year, the combination of reductions in natural gas prices, margin amounts required to support our retail marketing operations, unfavorable market conditions and a reduction in our net credit facility availability has prevented us from realizing additional revenues and earnings. Continued reduction in amounts available under the credit facilities may restrict our ability to pursue optimization strategies. The inability to pursue such revenue strategies may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nSegment Information\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOur process for the identification of reportable segments involves examining the nature of services offered, the types of customer contracts entered into and the nature of the economic and regulatory environment. Since our inception, we have operated along functional lines in our commercial, engineering and operations teams for operations in Alberta, northern California and the U.S. midcontinent. All functional lines and facilities offer the same services: fee-based revenue and optimization. All services are delivered using reservoir storage. All facilities have the same types of customers: major companies in the energy industry, industrial, commercial, and local distribution companies and municipal energy consumers. We also have a marketing business which is an extension of our proprietary optimization activities. Proprietary optimization activities occur when we purchase, store and sell natural gas for our own account in order to utilize or optimize storage capacity that is not contracted or available to third party customers. We measure profitability consistently along all functional lines based on revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and unrealized risk management gains and losses. We have aggregated our functional lines and facilities into one reportable segment as at and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIn connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Brookfield agreed to lend up to $50.0 million to the Company under a short-term credit facility to be used for working capital purposes. During fiscal 2016, reduced liquidity resulting from lower profitability, and the absence of the last 15% of availability under the Revolving Credit Facilities was partially offset by the funds available under the Short-Term Credit Facility from Brookfield, as well as the liquidation of optimization inventories, and the return of a portion of posted margin deposits associated with the Company's marketing business.\nOur $320 Million Revolving Credit Facilities\n\u2022 Impairment of Goodwill. During fiscal 2015, we concluded that a number of factors, including the continued narrow seasonal spread environment, combined with the significant reduction in natural gas price volatility, and a strong decline in our market capitalization were impairment indicators. As a result of this determination, we performed an impairment test and concluded the remaining balance of our goodwill was fully impaired, and therefore an impairment charge of $245.6 million was recorded.\nInterest expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased by $1.0 million (2%) compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Higher average interest rates were partially offset by the impacts of lower average balances of our credit facilities compared to the level of drawings during fiscal 2015.\n(1)LTF revenue during the first quarter of 2015 includes a one-time early termination payment of $26.0 million from TransCanada due to the termination of the previous storage agreement with TransCanada.\nInvesting Activities. Most of the investing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were attributed to maintenance activities. Maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives. A significant drawdown of natural gas inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 resulted in significant operational burdens on our facilities and therefore, required additional maintenance capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 and 2015.\n <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> Unit-based compensation See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, on our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of policy in accounting for unit-based compensation. The fair value of unit-based awards that are expected to be settled in cash is determined on the date of grant and is re-measured at each reporting period until the settlement date. The fair value at each re-measurement date is equal to the settlement expected to be incurred based on the anticipated number of units vested adjusted for (1) the passage of time and (2) the payout threshold associated with the performance targets which we expect to achieve compared to our established peers. Compensation expense is calculated as the re-measured expected payout less previously-recognized compensation expense. There are uncertainties in our calculation of unit-based compensation since it requires us to make assumptions and judgments on the estimated probabilities of meeting our performance measures, forfeiture rate and unit price at settlement date. The fair value of unit-based awards that are expected to be settled in units is determined on the date of grant and is amortized into equity using the straight-line method over the vesting period. \n\nWe have an agreement with Brookfield for a $50.0 million short term credit facility (the \"Short-term Credit Facility\"), for which borrowings bear interest at an annual rate of 10%. Interest is payable in cash on a quarterly basis, unless the Company elects to pay such interest in-kind by capitalizing accrued interest into the principal amount. See Note 8 \"-Short-term Credit Facility\" in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\u2022 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consisted of the following:\n\u2022 LTF Revenues. Fiscal 2016 LTF revenues declined by $44.5 million (55%) from fiscal 2015. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to a one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million received from TransCanada in fiscal 2015, for which there was no corresponding amounts in fiscal 2016. The remainder of the decrease in revenues largely resulted from lower contract rates that caused revenues to decline by $14.2 million, and lower customer utilization that resulted in a decrease in variable fees of $2.9 million. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates between the Canadian and U.S. dollar decreased revenues by $3.3 million compared to last year. The declines were partially offset by higher allocated capacity of 7.4 Bcf to LTF revenues, resulting in an increase of $1.9 million. The realized margins were $0.37 per Mcf of storage capacity in fiscal 2016 compared to $0.89 per Mcf in fiscal 2015. Excluding the one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million, realized margin would have been $0.60 per Mcf in fiscal 2015.\nresulted from numerous factors, including, but not limited to: (i) production curtailments in Alberta due to prolonged compressor outages on the TransCanada Alberta System and high cash prices at PG&A Citygate during injection season; (ii) lower levels of natural gas in storage which led to increased demand in the cash market; (iii) real or perceived changes in overall supply and demand fundamentals; (iv) the development of new pipeline infrastructure connecting new supply to markets; (v) the weather during the first part of winter being milder than normal; and (vi) a material year-over-year increase in natural gas production in the United States as well as in Western Canada during the winter withdrawal season. These market conditions have negatively impacted our revenues during the year ended March 31, 2016 by eroding the prices we can charge for long and short-term firm contracting services, as well as reducing the profitability of our optimization activities, where we make economically hedged natural gas purchases for our own account.\nChanges in the Value of the Canadian Dollar versus the U.S. Dollar\n\u2022 capitalization and leverage; and\n(1)Excluding the one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million from TransCanada, realized margins would have been $0.60 per Mcf in fiscal 2015.\nThe historical financial statements included in this document have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires our judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. Our judgments and estimates are based on what we believe are the best and most relevant information available to us at the time our financial statements are prepared.\nAs at March 31, 2016, available liquidity totaled $66.8 million, consisting of $56.9 million available under the Revolving Credit Facilities and $9.9 million available under the Short-Term Credit Facility\nThe change in revenue was primarily attributable to the following:\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had a FCCR of 0.3 to 1.0, a ratio of total debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 42.8 times, a ratio of long-term debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 34.2 times and a ratio of long-term debt to long-term debt plus equity of 87.9%.\nMarket Conditions for Natural Gas Storage\nResults of Operations\n\nThe historical financial statements included elsewhere in this document reflect the consolidated assets, liabilities and operations of Niska Gas Storage Partners LLC (\"Niska Partners\" or the \"Company\") as at March 31, 2016 and 2015, and for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The following discussion of the historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and accompanying notes of the Company included elsewhere in this document. In addition, this discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may result in actual results differing from statements we make. See \"Forward-Looking Statements.\" Factors that could cause actual results to differ include those risks and uncertainties that are discussed in \"Risk Factors.\"\n\u2022 Interest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2015 decreased by $15.0 million (23%) compared to the year ended March 31, 2014. Interest on our Senior Notes was reduced as a result of a lower interest rate and lower outstanding balances. During fiscal 2015, the Senior Notes consisted of $575.0 million of 6.50% Senior Notes due in 2019. During fiscal 2014, the Senior Notes consisted of $643.8 million of 8.875% Senior Notes, which were redeemed in March 2014. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest on our revolving credit facilities due to higher utilization.\nVariable Costs\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $57.3 million compared to cash used in operating activities of $39.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities principally reflects the decision to hold on to a significant volume of inventory at the end of fiscal 2015 and sell that inventory during fiscal 2016. Positive cash flows from operating activities were offset by the lower profitability after non-cash gains, losses and expenses were excluded.\nWe have senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the \"6.50% Senior Notes\" or \"Notes\") for which interest is payable semi-annually on October 1 and April 1 at a rate of 6.50% per year, and will mature on April 1, 2019. See Note 8 \"-Senior Notes due 2019\" in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOn June 9, 2016, the CPUC issued a decision which approved the transfer of control of the Wild Goose facility to Brookfield, effective immediately. The Company believes that it is probable that the Merger will be completed on or before July 31, 2016 at which time the Company will pursue replacement financing. Should the merger not close as anticipated, the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facilities on September 30, 2016 would require the Company to seek a further extension of the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay the amounts projected to be outstanding at that time. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain a further extension of the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay our Revolving Credit Facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility upon maturity.\n\u2022 Income Tax Expense (Benefit). The income tax benefit in the current year is primarily due to the tax planning strategies undertaken in connection with certain taxable Canadian entities and the recognition of losses in those entities.\nOverview\n\u2022 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by $13.1 million (33%) in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of lower incentive accruals related to short-and long-term compensation plans.\nIn addition to the underlying profitability of our business, our cash flows are significantly influenced by our level of natural gas inventory, margin deposits and related forward purchase and sale contracts or hedging positions at the end of each accounting period and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. In addition, our period-to-period cash flows are heavily influenced by the seasonality of our proprietary optimization activities. For example, we generally purchase significant quantities of natural gas during the summer months and sell natural gas during the winter months. The storage of natural gas for our own account can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities for the period we pay for and store the natural gas and the subsequent period in which we receive proceeds from the sale of natural gas. When we purchase and store natural gas for our own account, we use cash to pay for the natural gas and record the gas as inventory and thereby reduce our cash flows from operating activities. We typically borrow on our Revolving Credit Facilities to fund these purchases, and these borrowings increase our cash flows from financing activities. Conversely, when we collect the proceeds from the sale of natural gas that we purchased and stored for our own account, the impact on our cash flows from operating activities is positive and the impact on our cash flows from financing activities is negative. Therefore, our cash flows from operating activities fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as we purchase natural gas, store it, and then sell it in a later period. In addition, we have margin requirements on our economically hedged positions. As the cash deposits we make to satisfy our margin requirements increase and decrease with our volume of derivative positions and changes in commodity prices, our cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nSimilarly, Cash Available for Distribution has certain limitations because it accounts for some, but not all, of the above limitations.\n\u2022 Realized Optimization Revenues. Net realized optimization revenues decreased by $17.6 million compared to fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, storage capacity allocated to this revenue strategy was reduced by 29.5 Bcf and the average realized margin for optimization activities was $0.37 per Mcf in fiscal 2016 compared to $0.45 per Mcf in fiscal 2015. The profitability realized per Mcf of optimization capacity was reduced in the current year as a result of the suppressed spread environment and a lack of market volatility of natural gas across North American markets during fiscal 2016.\nWe regularly monitor our credit metrics. Our most important credit metric is our fixed charge coverage ratio, or FCCR, which is contained in the Indenture to our 6.50% Senior Notes and our Credit Agreement. The FCCR measures our Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges, both of which are defined in the Indenture and Credit Agreement. As discussed below, when our FCCR is below 2.0 times, we are restricted in our ability to issue new debt. When our FCCR is below 1.75 times, we are restricted in our ability to pay distributions. When our FCCR is below 1.1 times, we are unable to borrow the last 15% of availability without triggering an event of default. We also monitor our ratio of long-term and total debt to Adjusted EBITDA and our ratio of debt to debt plus equity. While these metrics are not included in our Indenture or Credit Agreement, they are common metrics used to measure the credit-worthiness of companies, including those similar to us.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million (12%) in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Legal, audit and regulatory costs for fiscal 2016 included $4.5 million of expenses related to the Transaction. Excluding the costs associated with the Transaction, total general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 would have been $25.5 million. Compensation costs were higher in fiscal 2016 due to cost recoveries realized in fiscal 2015 as a result of the reversals of prior-year incentive compensation accruals and retention incentive plan accruals related to the Transaction. The increases in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016 were offset by a reduction in costs of $2.8 million resulting from the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\nBackwardation, a condition where the price of natural gas in the near term is higher than the price for future delivery, occurred in the winter of fiscal 2014 and spring of fiscal 2015. This increased our costs to manage our cycling requirements, which include the purchase or lease of natural gas used for temporary pressure support. The cost of temporary pressure support gas was approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2016 (fiscal 2015-$40.0 million). Over the upcoming four years, the expected cumulative cost of temporary pressure support gas is $5.5 million which relates to our commitments to lease certain volumes of natural gas to address our future temporary pressure support needs. In the event that natural gas storage market conditions become more favorable, the cost of managing our operational requirements could be reduced. However, if the conditions deteriorate, the cost of managing our operational requirements will increase.\nMarket conditions for natural gas storage can change rapidly as a result of a number of factors, including weather patterns, overall storage levels across North America in the markets we serve, current and anticipated levels of natural gas supply and demand, and constraints on pipeline infrastructure capacity. Accordingly, current market conditions may not be a reliable predictor of future market conditions. Longer term, we believe several factors may contribute to meaningful growth in North American natural gas demand, including: (i) exports of North American Liquefied Natural Gas; (ii) fuel switching for power generation from coal to natural gas; (iii) construction of new gas-fired power plants; (iv) growing exports to Mexico; and (v) growth in base-load industrial demand, all of which could bolster the demand for, and the commercial value of, natural gas storage. We are unable to predict the timing or magnitude of such events nor can we predict the ultimate impact they may have on our results of operations.\n\nVolume and Fees Derived from Fee-based Contracts\nour results of operations because its impact on revenues has been offset by lower expenses and hedging gains realized during the period.\nAs of June 6, 2016, we had $41.1 million in borrowings outstanding under our Short-term Credit Facility and were in compliance with all covenant requirements.\nOur capital expenditures for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nDuring the past several years, North America has experienced a dramatic increase in the supply of natural gas, principally from the development of unconventional natural gas sources, including shale gas. These increases in supply have been coupled with build-outs of natural gas pipeline capacity in certain areas of the United States, which generally have the effect of increasing deliverability of natural gas to more North American markets and dampening the price differentials for natural gas between geographic markets, including those served by us. We are unable to determine or predict the direct impact on our business from these developments. However, we believe that the market will return to a more balanced level because gas demand is expected to increase in the medium term due to (1) a forecasted increase in base load industrial demand, (2) construction of new gas fired power plants and coal to gas switching (3) increased exports to Mexico, and (4) exports of LNG.\n(7)Excludes NGPL-leased capacity of 2.9 Bcf in fiscal 2016, and 8.5 Bcf in fiscal years prior.\n\u2022 Unrealized Risk Management Gains (Losses). Unrealized risk management gains for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 were $31.7 million compared to losses of $8.7 million in fiscal 2014. Unrealized gains in fiscal 2015 were due to increases in the value of financial hedges resulting from decreases in forward sales price of natural gas relative to our contracts. Losses in fiscal 2014 were due to prices rising after financial hedges were transacted in prior periods. Unrealized risk management gains and losses from our natural gas marketing operations amounted to a loss of $0.6 million and a gain of $0.8 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe combination of reductions in natural gas prices, collateral required to support our retail marketing operations, costs associated with the requirements for temporary reservoir pressure support and unfavorable market conditions which have prevented us from realizing additional revenues and earnings have reduced the liquidity available under our credit facilities. Continued reduction in amounts available under our credit facilities may continue to restrict our ability to pursue optimization strategies. The inability to pursue such revenue strategies may have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenues and profitability.\nThe following table illustrates the differences in the recognition of revenue associated with our revenue strategies.\nRealized optimization revenues include revenues from our natural gas marketing operations of $15.3 million and $13.0 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue from the marketing business increased compared to last year as a result of a stronger residential market in Western Canada as well as our commercial market in Eastern Canada.\nPlease refer to Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCushion migration occurs when hydrocarbons move to an area of the storage reservoir where effective support in cycling a facility's working gas is no longer provided. During the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded charges to depreciation expense of $24.5 million, $64.7 million and $nil, respectively, related to 2.4 Bcf, 6.2 Bcf and nil Bcf of proprietary cushion estimated to have migrated at our Canadian facilities. We currently estimate that ongoing cushion migration could require an annual expenditure of approximately $4.0 million to $6.0 million to replace the cushion gas that has migrated. These estimates include assumptions about storage levels and cycling requirements which can vary significantly depending on operating conditions.\nWe have senior secured asset-based revolving credit facilities, consisting of a U.S. and a Canadian revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facilities\", or the \"Credit Agreement\"). These credit facilities in aggregate provide a maximum borrowing capacity of $320.0 million, and can be drawn on up to the lesser of the borrowing base asset or the maximum borrowing capacity. See Note 8 \"-Revolving Credit Facilities\" in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nCustomer Usage Patterns\nWe monitor both the volume and price of our LTF and STF contracts in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing efforts as well as the relative attractiveness of each of these types of contracts compared to each other as well as in comparison to our optimization strategy. During periods when market values for storage capacity are higher, we typically use more of our capacity under LTF contracts. The fees we are able to generate from our LTF and STF contracts reflect market conditions, including interest rates. The capacity used for STF contracts depends, among other things, on available capacity not reserved under LTF contracts as well as market demand and contract rates available for these services.\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, legal, accounting and tax consulting fees, and our office leases.\nMaintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives.\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution in this report. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution to net earnings (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is shown above.\n\u2022 Write-Down of Inventory. Natural gas prices fell during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. This reduction increased the value of our economic hedges and decreased the value of the proprietary optimization inventory underlying those hedges. With the realization of hedging gains positioned in the current fiscal year and the positioning of new hedges at lower values in future periods, the estimated market value of our inventories became less than its carrying cost. Accordingly, we wrote down our proprietary inventories by $4.3 million in fiscal 2016 and $63.8 million during fiscal 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution\nAs we begin fiscal 2017, market conditions for natural gas storage are improving, with widening seasonal spreads and increasing volatility. The Company estimates that, based on expected revenues, of which over 80% have already been transacted across all revenue strategies, and expected costs, the Company will generate sufficient cash flow to fund its operations for the next twelve months, except for the repayment of the outstanding balances of the Revolving Credit Facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility on their respective maturity dates. Failure to repay the Revolving Credit Facilities when due would also constitute an event of default under the terms of the 6.50% Senior Notes.\n\u2022 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2015 increased by $76.0 million (184%) compared to the prior year. The increase reflected provisions for cushion migration totaling $64.7 million related to 6.2 Bcf of proprietary cushion estimated to have migrated at our facilities, and a provision of $11.7 million for amortization of intangible assets related to the termination of a contract with TransCanada.\nfiscal 2014. The increase in loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to lower net revenue as discussed above, plus the following:\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n(6)Represents operated and NGPL-leased capacity. Effective working gas capacity data is as at March 31 of each year. In April 2015, 5.6 Bcf of leased capacity from NGPL expired, bringing our total NGPL-leased capacity down to 2.9 Bcf.\nfrom Brookfield. At June 6, 2016, available liquidity was $89.2 million, consisting of $79.3 million available under the Revolving Credit Facilities and $9.9 million available under the Short-Term Credit Facility from Brookfield.\nFunding the purchase of proprietary optimization inventory can consume a significant portion of our available working capital. Accordingly, we closely monitor the utilization and remaining available capacity under our credit facilities and actively pursue additional short-term firm contracts when we determine it is appropriate to maintain liquidity.\nUnder our current plan, we expect to spend approximately $11.0 million to $13.0 million in fiscal 2017 for maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the integrity of our storage facilities and ensure the reliable injection, storage and withdrawal of natural gas for our customers. Included in our estimated maintenance capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 is $6.0 million related to expected cushion gas purchases. Expansion capital for fiscal 2017 is expected to be less than $1.0 million.\nOur 6.50% Senior Notes Due 2019\n <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> Fair Value of Risk Management Assets and Liabilities We use natural gas derivatives and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in natural gas prices and foreign exchange rates. These financial assets and liabilities, which are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, are included into one of three categories based on a fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our derivative contracts are recorded as risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as either current assets, non-current assets, or liabilities based upon the anticipated settlement date of the contracts. The determination of the fair value of these derivative contracts reflects the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are uncertainties in our methodology in the determination of fair value since it requires us to consider various factors, including over-the-counter quotations, location differentials and closing foreign exchange rates underlying the contracts. Although the fair value of our risk management assets and liabilities may fluctuate, such fluctuations are offset by equivalent changes in the value of our physical inventory. Our policy is for our inventory and purchases to be economically hedged, within small tolerances permitted under our risk management policy, so we are not exposed economically to the risk of fluctuating commodity prices. Inventory Our inventory is natural gas injected into storage and held for resale. Inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market. Adjustments to write down the costs of inventory to market are recorded as an offset to optimization revenues while costs to store the gas are recognized as operating expenses in the period the costs are incurred. At the end of each reporting period we determine whether a write-down is required to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market value. This determination has built-in uncertainties since it requires judgment in estimating fair market values in the periods to which our inventory is economically hedged and the level of a normal margin compared to selling price in those periods. Cushion Effectiveness Certain volumes of cushion are required for maintaining a minimum field pressure. Cushion is considered a component of the facility and as such is not depreciated. Cushion is monitored to ensure that it provides effective pressure support. In the event that natural gas moves to another area of the reservoir where it does not provide effective pressure support, charges against cushion are included in depreciation in an amount equal to the cost of estimated volumes that have migrated. Cushion requirements and its effectiveness are estimated using pressure and volumetric data accumulated over many years of storage operation. The data is added into a complex reservoir model which accounts for different dynamic phenomena occurring within the reservoir. The information incorporated into the model includes pressure gradients within the reservoir, water encroachment due to an active aquifer, tight reservoir components which slowly capture and release back some of the gas stored and a cushion migration component. These phenomena influence one another and the level of uncertainty of the estimate of cushion present in a reservoir. \nA summary of financial and operating data for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\u2022 the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and make distributions to our equity holders;\nin the early summer (instead of a steady rate of injections throughout the summer), we would have higher costs in our first quarter and lower than expected costs in the second quarter. A mild winter could lead to less withdrawals in total, and therefore lower overall fuel and power costs because less injections would occur in filling our storage facilities. These cost variances could be partially offset by similar variances in long-term contract revenues. During the year ended March 31, 2016, operating expenses were lower than the year ended March 31, 2015, principally due to lower facility utilization, and lower average fuel and electricity prices.\nSee also \"How We Evaluate Our Operations-Capitalization, Leverage and Liquidity\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar. We generate revenues from our Canadian operations in Canadian dollars. Cash inflows from revenues are offset, in part, by natural gas inventory purchases, operating, general and administrative and capital costs that are also transacted in Canadian dollars. The majority of our hedges are transacted in U.S. dollars on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Our financial instruments, principally our Common Units, Senior Notes and credit facilities, are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. We hedge our net exposure to the Canadian dollar by entering into currency hedges for the substantial majority of net exposure for our transactions. We do not hedge our net Canadian dollar exposure for potential future transactions, as the timing and amount of those transactions, which include proprietary optimization purchases and sales, are difficult to predict. During fiscal 2016, the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar did not materially impact\nIn June 2015, the Company, the Manager, Holdco and certain of their affiliates entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Brookfield. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Brookfield will acquire all of the Company's outstanding common units for $4.225 per common unit in cash and will acquire the Managing Member and the IDRs in the Company prior to June 14, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2016 we had a net working capital deficiency of $79.5 million (working capital ratio of 0.7 to 1.0, which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities), compared to a net working capital deficiency of $24.6 million (working capital ratio of 0.9 to 1.0) as at March 31, 2015. The increase in cash flows from changes in working capital principally reflects the decision to hold on to a significant volume of inventory at the end of fiscal 2015 and sell that inventory during fiscal 2016.\nAt times, if spreads move favorably, such as if winter gas prices fall below forward prices for the following summer, we can further increase margins that have been substantially locked in by choosing to hold inventory into a subsequent period and re-hedging the transaction. This has the result of increasing our cash flow margins and overall profitability although for accounting purposes the income is recognized in a later period, causing cyclicality in our reported revenues and profits.\nThe change in revenue was primarily attributable to the following:\nWhen evaluating the performance of our optimization business, we focus on our realized optimization margins, excluding the impact of unrealized hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs. For accounting purposes, our realized optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs, which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period. However, because substantially all inventory is economically hedged, any inventory write-downs are offset by hedging gains and any unrealized hedging losses are offset by gains when the inventory is sold. These offsetting gains and losses may occur in different periods.\nIn connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Brookfield agreed to lend up to $50.0 million to the Company under a short-term credit facility to be used for working capital purposes. During fiscal 2016, reduced liquidity due to lower profitability was partially offset by the funds available under the Short-Term Credit Facility. As at March 31, 2016, the balance under the Short-term Credit Facility was $40.1 million, and the Company had $66.8 million of total available liquidity, compared to $80.1 million at March 31, 2015.\n\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue through long- and short-term contracts for the storage of natural gas for third-party customers and the proprietary optimization of storage capacity that is\nCapital Expenditures\nThe GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution is net earnings. The non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution should not be considered as alternatives to net earnings (loss). Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and have important limitations as analytical tools. Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor Cash Available for Distribution should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings (loss) and are defined differently by different companies, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nOur most significant variable operating expenses are fuel and electricity costs. These operating expenses vary significantly based upon the amount of natural gas we inject or withdraw throughout the year and the price of the energy commodity at the time of purchase. Variable operating expenses are partially offset by the variable fees we collect from our LTF contracts. The fixed component of our operating expenses include salaries and labor, parts and supplies, surface and mineral lease rentals and other general operating costs. These fixed operating expenses are more stable from year to year but can fluctuate due to unforeseen repairs.\n\u2022 operating, general and administrative expenses;\n\n\nWe purchase natural gas and build inventories in the summer months. We position sales in the winter months, which results in the peak borrowing under our $320 million Credit Agreement being highest in the middle of our third fiscal quarter, while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in our fourth fiscal quarter. During fiscal 2016, we experienced an unusual storage season when we recognized revenue more evenly throughout the year.\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2016, the difference between summer and winter prices in the natural gas futures market, referred to as the seasonal spread, remained extremely narrow. This condition\n\u2022 Write-Down of Inventory. Natural gas prices fell during the year ended March 31, 2015. This reduction increased the value of our economic hedges and decreased the value of the proprietary optimization inventory underlying those hedges. With the realization of hedging gains positioned in fiscal 2015 and the positioning of new hedges at lower values in the then future periods, the estimated market value of our inventories became less than its carrying cost. Accordingly, we wrote down our proprietary inventories by $63.8 million during fiscal 2015.\nChanges in working gas capacity are expected to impact the level of our revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, our contract for 5.6 Bcf of the 8.5 Bcf leased capacity on NGPL expired thereby reducing our gas storage capacity to approximately 244.9 Bcf . On May 1, 2016, 1.0 Bcf of the remaining 2.9 Bcf leased capacity on NGPL expired, thereby reducing our gas storage capacity to approximately 243.9 Bcf. We do not expect these changes will cause a significant reduction to future earnings.\nThe closing of the Transaction is dependent on the satisfaction of certain conditions related to regulatory requirements, including the approval of the CPUC. On May 12, 2016, the CPUC issued a Proposed Decision, which if finally approved will allow the transfer of control of Wild Goose to Brookfield and also allow the Transaction to proceed to close in accordance with the Merger Agreement. The Proposed Decision can still be amended prior to being voted on by the CPUC and may or may not be approved by the CPUC.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2010, we entered into an operating lease for compression and other equipment related to the development of an expansion project at Wild Goose. See \"Note 20-Commitments and Contingencies\" for more information.\nInflation has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years, it remains a factor in the current economy.\nAs we begin fiscal 2017, market conditions for natural gas storage are improving, with widening seasonal spreads. The Company estimates that, based on expected revenues, of which over 80% have already been transacted across all revenue strategies, and expected costs, the Company will generate sufficient cash flow to fund its operations for the next twelve months, except for the repayment of the outstanding balances of the Revolving Credit facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility on their respective maturity dates. Failure to repay the Revolving Credit Facilities when due would also constitute an event of default under the terms of the 6.50% Senior Notes.\nfinancial measures by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as commercial banks and ratings agencies, to assess:\nDuring fiscal 2015, the reduction in cash provided by operating activities was principally related to lower profitability and higher margining requirements associated with our retail business, combined with our decision to hold proprietary inventories over the end of fiscal 2015 in order to sell them in fiscal 2016.\nVolume and Margin Derived from Our Proprietary Optimization Activities\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and impacts our ability to generate profits and cash flows. Therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense may have material limitations;\n\u2022 Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes. Loss before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 was $382.3 million compared to a loss before income taxes of $19.2 million in\n(2)Loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended March 31, 2014 relates to the redemption of our 8.875% Senior Notes due 2018 in March 2014. The loss consisted of a call premium of $28.6 million along with the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of the 8.875% Senior Notes in 2010.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities consists of debt incurred for the acquisition of assets, periodic optional and mandatory retirements of such debt, advances and repayments made on our credit facilities to fund proprietary inventory purchases, and debt retirements and distributions made to our equity holders.\nIn addition, our storage facilities may require additional natural gas to provide temporary pressure support during periods of high activity to meet cycling requirements and performance demands related to our gas in storage. These volumes fluctuate from year to year along with our cycling requirements. These cycling requirements are managed through a combination of strategies which are adapted to changes in natural gas market conditions. Typically, the use of gas to provide temporary pressure support results in net revenue gains because the cost to acquire natural gas in the nearer term is lower than the price of natural gas for future delivery.\nOperating expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased by $9.4 million (24%) compared to the prior year. Reductions in operating expenses for fiscal 2016 were principally the result of lower facility utilization which reduced fuel and electricity consumption. Additionally, leased storage capacity was reduced by 5.6 Bcf at April 1, 2015, resulting in a decrease in lease costs. Maintenance costs in the prior period were higher due to heavy equipment usage during the winter of fiscal 2014 resulting in significantly higher equipment repairs throughout fiscal 2015. In addition, a weaker Canadian dollar reduced expenses associated with our Canadian facilities by $1.6 million for 2016.\noptimization was driven by a reduction in capacity allocated to the strategy in the current period, offset by an increased allocation to fee-based transactions.\n\n\u2022 volume and margin derived from our proprietary optimization activities;\nOur business is highly seasonal. In general, revenue is expected to be highest during our third and fourth fiscal quarters (October through March), during the peak of the natural gas storage winter withdrawal season, when we typically sell most of our optimization inventory to serve the seasonal demand created by the North American residential market which uses natural gas to heat their homes. Revenue is typically lower in the natural gas storage summer months (April through October), when natural gas prices are generally lower and we shift to the storage injection season and replenish our natural gas inventory.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe Company's available liquidity consists of amounts available under its Revolving Credit Facilities and its Short-Term Credit Facility. In February 2016, the Company completed an amendment and extension of its Credit Agreement, which reduced the maximum capacity to $320.0 million and extends the term of the original agreement from June 29, 2016 to September 30, 2016 and allows for an additional term extension to December 31, 2016 providing that the Transaction has closed. The Company's fixed charge coverage ratio (\"FCCR\") has been below 1.1:1.0 since the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and as a result the Company continued to be unable to borrow the last 15% of availability under the Revolving Credit Facilities without triggering an event of default.\nWe operate the AECO HubTM, which consists of the Countess and Suffield gas storage facilities in Alberta, Canada, and the Wild Goose and Salt Plains gas storage facilities in California and Oklahoma, respectively. Niska Partners markets gas storage services of working gas capacity in addition to optimizing storage capacity with its own proprietary gas purchases at each of these facilities. We also operate a natural gas marketing business which is an extension of our propriety optimization activities in Canada. The Company has a total of 243.9 Bcf of working gas capacity among its facilities, including 1.9 Bcf leased from a third-party pipeline company.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\nuncontracted, underutilized or available only on a short-term basis. We evaluate our business on the basis of the following key measures:\nSupply and Demand for Natural Gas\n\n\u2022 Revenue. Revenues include fee-based revenue and optimization, net. Fee-based revenue consists of long-term contracts for storage fees that are generated when we provide storage services on a monthly basis and short-term fees associated with specified injections and withdrawals of natural gas. Optimization revenue results from the purchase of natural gas inventory and its forward sale to future periods through energy trading contracts, with our facilities being used to store the inventory between the purchase and sale of the natural gas inventory.\n\u2022 volume and fees derived from fee-based contracts;\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe earn revenues by providing natural gas storage services on a long-term firm (\"LTF\") contract basis for which we receive monthly reservation fees for fixed amounts of storage, providing storage services on a short-term firm (\"STF\") contract basis, where a customer pays a fixed fee to inject a specified quantity of natural gas on a specified date or dates and a fixed fee to withdraw on a specified future date or dates, and optimization, where we purchase and sell gas on an economically hedged basis in order to improve facility utilization at margins that can be higher than those from third-party contracts. Proprietary optimization activities occur when the Company purchases and sells natural gas for its own account. Our revenues related to our marketing business are included in proprietary optimization activities. We have aggregated all of our activities in one reportable operating segment for financial reporting purposes. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\u2022 the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015\nCapitalization, Leverage and Liquidity\n(1)Purchase obligations consisted of forward physical and financial commitments related to future purchases of proprietary natural gas inventory and cushion gas. As we economically hedge substantially all of our natural gas purchases, there are forward sales that offset these commitments which are not included in the above table. As at March 31, 2016, forward physical and financial sales for all future periods related to proprietary gas totaled $994.5 million. As at March 31, 2016, forward financial sales for all future periods relating to cushion gas totaled $7.3 million.\nSee also \"How We Evaluate Our Operations-Capitalization, Leverage and Liquidity.\"\nThe fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 reflected a continuation of difficult market conditions for Niska. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $17.1 million, compared to $66.7 million in fiscal 2015 and $140.0 million in fiscal 2014. Included in the fiscal 2016 amounts are benefits of inventory write-downs of $45.2 million. Fiscal 2015 included a one-time contract termination settlement with our largest customer of $26.0 million and benefits from inventory write-downs of $23.1 million. Excluding these amounts, Adjusted EBITDA would have been negative $28.1 million for fiscal 2016 and positive $17.6 million for fiscal 2015. The unfavorable financial results in fiscal 2016 resulted from extraordinarily low seasonal spreads which substantially reduced the value of our storage\nIn addition, in fiscal 2016 and 2015 the Company recorded non-cash charges of additional depreciation of $24.5 million and $64.7 million respectively, associated with migration of cushion gas at its Canadian-based facilities. The combination of poor market conditions and non-cash charges resulted in a net loss for the fiscal 2016 of $103.3 million, compared to fiscal 2015 net loss of $350.7 million.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not include provision for income taxes. Because the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our costs, any measure that excludes income tax expense may have material limitations;\nInflation\nIncremental revenue opportunities in the form of STF or proprietary optimization transactions may arise for us if capacity usage by our LTF customers is underutilized or offset by other LTF customers.\n(5)Long-term debt includes long-term obligations under capital lease, but excludes credit facility drawings which are recorded in current liabilities.\nWhen market conditions warrant, we enter into economically hedged transactions with available capacity. This can achieve higher margins than can be obtained from third-party contracts. Because we economically hedge our transactions, we are able to determine in advance the minimum margins that will be realized and add incremental margins by re-hedging as market conditions change.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, unrealized risk management gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, foreign exchange gains and losses, write-downs of inventory, gains and losses on asset dispositions, non-cash compensation, asset impairments and other income. We believe the adjustments for other income are similar in nature to the traditional adjustments to net earnings used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and adjustment for these items results in an appropriate representation of this financial measure. Cash Available for Distribution is defined as Adjusted EBITDA reduced by interest expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), income taxes paid, maintenance capital expenditures and other income. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution are used as supplemental\nHistorical Cash Flows\nCushion Migration and Pressure Support\nAmortization of intangible assets during fiscal 2015 included $11.7 million of amortization related to the termination of the prior storage agreement with TransCanada and the establishment of a new contract.\nRealized optimization revenues include revenues from our natural gas marketing operations of $13.0 million and $9.7 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue from the marketing business increased as a result of a stronger residential market in Western Canada.\nFactors that impact the performance of specific components of our business from period to period include the following:\nIn the future we may use off-balance sheet arrangements such as undrawn credit facility commitments, including letters of credit, to finance portions of our capital and operating needs. See \"-Contractual Obligations\" for more information.\nWe also provide fee-based services under short-term firm (STF) contracts, where a customer pays a fixed fee to inject a specified quantity of gas on a specified date or dates and to withdraw on a specified future date or dates.\nWhen winter gas prices fall below forward prices for the following summer we may defer the withdrawal of proprietary optimization inventory until the next fiscal year in order to reduce operating costs and add incremental margin and economic value, independent of the period in which that revenue is earned. This may result in the deferral of realized earnings and cash flow from one fiscal year to the next. This was evident during the year ended March 31, 2015, when increased gas supply in the United States resulted in a reduction in the demand for natural gas in storage and resulted in an overall decline in near-term natural gas prices. Due to the contango position of the forward market, we deferred the withdrawal of proprietary optimization inventory until fiscal 2016. As a result, proprietary optimization inventory at March 31, 2015 was relatively high at approximately 48 MDth, as compared to March 31, 2016 proprietary inventory levels of 26 MDth. The year over year decrease in proprietary\nOn June 9, 2016, the CPUC issued a decision which approved the transfer of control of the Wild Goose facility to Brookfield, effective immediately. The Company believes that it is probable that the Merger will be completed on or before July 31, 2016 at which time the Company will pursue replacement financing. Should the merger not close as anticipated, the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facilities on September 30, 2016 would require the Company to seek a further extension of the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay the amounts projected to be outstanding at that time. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to further extend the maturity date or raise additional funds to repay our Revolving Credit Facilities and the Short-Term Credit Facility upon maturity.\n\u2022 Optimization Revenues. Total optimization revenues, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, along with write-downs of proprietary optimization inventories, decreased to a loss of $0.4 million in fiscal 2016 compared to income of $6.0 million in fiscal 2015. When evaluating the performance of our optimization business, we focus on our realized optimization margins, excluding the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs. For financial reporting purposes, our net optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write-downs, which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period. The components of optimization revenues are as follows:\nOperating Expenses\nInformation pertaining to our fee-based and proprietary optimization revenues is presented in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).\n\n\u2022 Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit decreased by $19.9 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. This change was primarily due to lower taxable losses as well as an increase in Canadian provincial income tax rate in fiscal 2016 both of which impacted certain Canadian taxable entities.\nWe recognize that the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as an evaluative tool may have certain limitations, including:\nThe following table summarizes by period the payments due for our estimated contractual obligations as of March 31, 2016:\n\u2022 Interest Expense. Interest expense consisted of the following:\nFactors that Impact Our Business\nOur $50 Million Short-term Credit Facility\nMaterial Agreements\n\u2022 repeatable operating performance that is not distorted by non-recurring items or market volatility; and\n\u2022 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses in fiscal 2015 decreased by $1.6 million (4%) compared to the prior year. Fuel and electricity costs declined by $2.0 million on account of lower average facility utilization, combined with declines in fuel and electricity prices. Salaries and benefits were reduced as a result of lower incentive compensation accruals. These reductions were partially offset by higher lease costs due to leasing additional cushion to manage our temporary pressure support requirements.\nThe following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the application of GAAP. These estimates affect, among other items, revenue recognition and expense accruals, migration of cushion, assessing income tax expense including the requirement for a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, calculating unit-based compensation, valuing of risk management assets and liabilities, inventory and identified intangible assets.\nExpansion capital expenditures are investments that serve to increase operating income over the long term through greater capacity or improved efficiency in Niska's operations, whether through construction or acquisition.\n\u2022 LTF Revenues. Fiscal 2015 LTF revenues declined by $3.2 million (4%) from fiscal 2014. The decrease in revenues resulted from lower fees realized, as well as lower storage capacity allocated to our LTF strategy. During fiscal 2015, lower rates caused revenues to decline by $14.9 million, and allocated capacity being lower by 18.8 Bcf contributed to a decrease of $12.0 million compared to fiscal 2014. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates between the Canadian and U.S. dollar decreased revenues by $2.3 million compared to fiscal 2014. These were partially offset by a one-time, early termination payment of $26.0 million received from TransCanada. Realized margins were $0.89 per Mcf of storage capacity in fiscal 2015 compared\nThe following table sets forth average volume utilized by, and revenue and fees/margins derived from LTF contracts, STF contracts and proprietary optimization transactions for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2016:\nWorking Gas Storage Capacity\n\u2022 STF Revenues. STF revenues decreased by $39.9 million (78%) compared to fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, STF rates were negatively affected by a suppressed spread environment. To a lesser degree, STF revenue was also impacted by certain transactions with lower contract rates that were entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to mitigate withdrawal risk. The effect of these contracts, which continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2015, resulted in lower STF revenue when compared to fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, the amount of capacity utilized for STF contracts increased by 0.7 Bcf. Realized margins were $0.15 per Mcf in fiscal 2015 compared to $0.69 per Mcf in fiscal 2014.\nCarried Inventory\n\n\u2022 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses consisted of the following:\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\n\u2022 STF Revenues. STF revenues increased by $6.9 million (60%) compared to fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, we increased the storage capacity allocated to this revenue strategy by 16.5 Bcf. In addition, during the year ended March 31, 2014, certain transactions with lower contract rates were entered into to mitigate withdrawal risk during the winter of fiscal 2014, the effects of which continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The lack of similar transactions in the year ended March 31, 2016 resulted in higher STF revenue when compared to the prior fiscal year. Realized margins were $0.20 per Mcf in fiscal 2016 compared to $0.15 per Mcf in fiscal 2015.\n <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> Impairment of Intangible Assets See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, on our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our policy regarding Intangible assets. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as impairment indicators arise. When such events or circumstances are present, the recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows. In the event that the sum of the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate future cash flows, the profitability of future business strategies, industry conditions and other economic factors. Income taxes We are not a taxable entity in the United States. Income taxes are the responsibility of the individual partners and have accordingly not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. We have corporate subsidiaries, which are taxable corporations subject to Canadian federal and provincial income taxes, which are included in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of policy in accounting for income taxes. Our accounting for income taxes has inherent uncertainties since it requires us to estimate the timing of the realization of our tax assets and liabilities, including the allocation of income among different entities and tax jurisdiction, and also requires us to make assumptions on the estimated probabilities of utilization of deferred tax assets and on the determination of tax exposures associated with our tax filing positions. \nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2014\nCarrying Costs and Availability of Liquidity\nWe are in compliance with all covenant requirements under the 6.50% Senior Notes.\n\u2022 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased by $59.9 million (51%) compared to the prior year. Depreciation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 included $24.5 million and $64.7 million, respectively, related to migration of cushion gas at our Canadian facilities for our estimated costs associated with proprietary cushion gas that no longer provides effective pressure support. After experiencing unprecedented deliverability requirements in fiscal 2014, an evaluation of facility performance, cycling capabilities, and costs associated with maintaining those capabilities was undertaken in fiscal 2015 determining that 6.2 Bcf of cushion gas had migrated and no longer provided effective cushion support. During fiscal 2016, 2.4 Bcf of cushion gas was estimated to have migrated.\nDetails of our revenue include:\nIn May 2014, we entered into a new contract with TransCanada, our largest volumetric customer. This new contract replaced a previous storage agreement which provided TransCanada with approximately 40 Bcf of storage capacity at our AECO facilities and had a term that extended to 2030. Under the previous storage agreement both parties had the option to terminate at the end of defined five-year intervals, including April 1, 2015. TransCanada elected to terminate this agreement and entered into a new agreement with us which extends until 2020. The new agreement provides TransCanada with an initial storage capacity of approximately 40 Bcf which will be reduced to approximately 20 Bcf on April 1, 2017. By exercising its early termination rights, TransCanada was obligated to make an early termination payment to us of $26.0 million. This payment was recognized in long-term firm revenue in fiscal 2015. The new rate under the renegotiated contract is lower than the rate previously in effect in prior fiscal periods, resulting in a decrease to LTF revenues in fiscal 2016.\n(1)Optimization revenue is presented net of cost of goods sold. Net optimization revenues include unrealized risk management gains/losses and write-downs of inventory. We had unrealized risk management losses of $16.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, unrealized risk management gains of $31.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, and unrealized risk management losses of $8.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2014. We had write-downs of inventory of $4.3 million, $63.8 million and $4.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding these non-cash items, which do not affect Adjusted EBITDA, our realized optimization revenues were $20.5 million, $38.1 million and $85.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nservices, and reduced price volatility resulting from increased gas supply in the market which, in turn, reduced our ability to capture additional value based on changes in natural gas prices.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA;\n <th>Description </th> <th> </th> <th>Judgments and Uncertainties </th> Revenue Recognition See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. Revenues are recognized when collectability is reasonably assured. Collectibility is evaluated on a customer-by-customer basis. New and existing customers are subject to a credit review process, which evaluates the customers' financial position (e.g. cash position and credit rating) and their ability to pay. If collectability is not considered reasonably assured at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with our credit review process, revenue is recognized when the fee is collected. Our revenue recognition accounting process contains uncertainties because it requires us to make a judgment on the collectability of revenue at the outset of an arrangement. In addition, our revenue also includes unrealized risk management gains and losses which require us to estimate fair value of our risk management contracts. \n\u2022 borrowing base revolver availability, liquidity, and compliance with debt covenants.\n(3)Goodwill impairment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 relates to goodwill in two subsidiaries that was determined to be fully impaired and, therefore, an impairment charge of $245.6 million was recorded.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\n(4)Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution in fiscal 2016 include the benefits of inventory write-downs related to inventory impairments of $45.2 million (fiscal 2015-$23.1 million; fiscal 2014-$2.4 million). Excluding these benefits, Adjusted EBITDA would have been negative $28.1 million for fiscal 2016 (fiscal 2015-$43.6 million; fiscal 2014-$137.6 million) and Cash Available for Distribution would have been negative $81.2 million for fiscal 2016 (fiscal 2015-negative $9.0 million; fiscal 2014-$72.6 million).\nThe variable operating costs of our facilities are primarily comprised of costs associated with natural gas and electricity for compressor operations. Our operating costs are affected by the amount and price of energy used to inject and withdraw natural gas from our facilities and by the number and timing of gas injections and withdrawals. For example, if we experience large injections of natural gas\n\u2022 Unrealized Risk Management (Losses) Gains. Unrealized risk management losses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 were $16.6 million compared to gains of $31.7 million in fiscal 2015. Unrealized losses in fiscal 2016 were due to decreases in the value of financial hedges resulting from decreases in the prices of forward purchase contracts of natural gas. Gains in fiscal 2015 were mainly due to increases in the value of financial hedges resulting from decreases in forward sales price of natural gas relative to our contracts. Unrealized risk management gains and losses from our natural gas marketing operations amounted to losses of $1.9 million and $0.6 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWorking Capital. Working capital is defined as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. Our working capital is affected by the relationship between unrealized risk management hedges which are marked-to-market on a monthly basis, the margin deposits required by our brokers for such gains and losses, proprietary inventory which is stored in our facilities and cash used to fund inventory purchases.\nThe Company's available liquidity consists of amounts available under its Revolving Credit Facilities and its Short-Term Credit Facility. In February 2016, the Company completed an amendment and extension of its Credit Agreement, which reduced the maximum capacity to $320.0 million and extends the term of the original agreement from June 29, 2016 to September 30, 2016, and allows for an additional term extension to December 31, 2016 provided that the Transaction has closed. However, the Company's FCCR has been below 1.1:1.0 since the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and, as a result, the Company has been unable to utilize the last 15% of availability under the Revolving Credit Facilities without triggering an event of default.\nContractual Obligations\nWe provide fee-based natural gas storage services to our customers under long-term firm (LTF) and short-term firm (STF) contracts. When a customer enters into a LTF contract, the customer is obligated to pay us monthly reservation fees for a fixed amount of storage which is usable by the customer at their option subject to contractual limits. These fees are fixed regardless of the actual use by the customer, and we also collect a variable fee when the services are actually used in order to allow us to recover our variable operating costs. The volume-weighted average life of our LTF contracts at March 31, 2016 was 2.6 years. Reservation fees comprise over 90% of the revenue generated under LTF contracts and provide a baseline of revenue to support our operating and general and administrative costs.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation and amortization expense. Because we use capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits. Therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense may have material limitations;\nOur most recently calculated borrowing base as of June 6, 2016 was $233.4 million. We also had $100.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facilities and had $19.1 million in letters of credit issued. We are in compliance with all covenant requirements under our Credit Agreement.\nOperating Activities. The variability in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to (1) changes in market conditions that exist during any given fiscal period, which impacts the margins earned under each of our fee-based and optimization activities; and (2) market conditions at the end of any given fiscal period, which impacts our decision to sell significant volumes of inventory or hold them over a fiscal period end. When we purchase and store natural gas, we borrow under our credit facilities to pay for it, which negatively impacts operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities increases when we collect the cash from the sale of inventories.\n\u2022 Realized Optimization Revenues. Net realized optimization revenues decreased by $47.3 million compared to fiscal 2014. The average realized margin for optimization activities was $0.45 per Mcf in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.29 per Mcf in fiscal 2014. The profitability of realized optimization was reduced in fiscal 2015 as a result of the suppressed spread environment and a lack of market volatility. Gains during the fiscal 2014 were driven by higher levels of volatility in North American natural gas markets, which resulted from changes in pipeline pricing in our Canadian markets during the summer and autumn of 2013. In addition, cold winter weather significantly increased demand for natural gas across North American markets in the latter part of 2013 and the first three months of 2014, which created significant opportunities.\n\u2022 Optimization Revenues. Total optimization revenues, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, along with write-downs of proprietary optimization inventories, decreased from $72.0 million in fiscal 2014 to $6.0 million in fiscal 2015. The components of optimization revenues are as follows:\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not allow us to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non-recurring items that materially affect our net earnings or loss.", "item_7_tables": "Table 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr>

LLC operates natural gas storage facilities and provides fee-based storage services and optimization of storage capacity. \n- Fiscal year 2016 was challenging with lower revenues and earnings due to poor market conditions, including narrow seasonal spreads and reduced price volatility. This resulted in a net loss of $103.3 million compared to a net loss of $350.7 million in fiscal 2015.\n\nKey Financial Results\n- Adjusted EBITDA was $17.1 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $66.7 million in fiscal 2015. Excluding one-time items, Adjusted EBITDA would have been negative in both years.\n- Revenues decreased to $54.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $98.3 million in fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower optimization and fee-based revenues.\n- A goodwill impairment charge of $245.6 million was recorded in fiscal 2015.\n- Higher interest expense and lower income tax benefit also contributed to the net loss in fiscal 2016. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Liquidity has been strained due to lower profitability. A $50 million short-term credit facility was secured to provide additional liquidity.  \n- Revolving credit facilities were amended and mature in September 2016. Securing refinancing by maturity is crucial.\n\nMarket Conditions \n- Narrow seasonal spreads, reduced price volatility, increased gas supply, and new pipeline infrastructure have negatively impacted storage values and optimization opportunities.\n- Market conditions are showing some signs of improvement going into fiscal 2017.\n\nThe report discusses the seasonality of the business, changes in revenues and margins, operating expenses, critical accounting estimates, liquidity position, market conditions, and outlook."}
