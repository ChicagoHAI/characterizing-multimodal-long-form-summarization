Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company's management. This MD&A is divided into four main sections:\n\u2022Overview\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies\nThe following MD&A should be read together with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The MD&A includes forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in these forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nPlease see Part I, Item 1. Business\u201d for a discussion of Colfax's objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. We report our operations through the following reportable segments:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gas and Fluid Handling - a global supplier of a broad range of gas- and fluid-handling products, including heavy-duty centrifugal and axial fans, rotary heat exchangers, gas compressors, pumps, fluid-handling systems and controls and specialty valves, which serves customers in the power generation, oil, gas and petrochemical, mining, marine (including defense) and general industrial and other end markets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fabrication Technology - a global supplier of welding equipment and consumables, cutting equipment and consumables and automated welding and cutting systems.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain amounts not allocated to the two reportable segments and intersegment eliminations are reported under the heading Corporate and other.\u201d\nColfax has a global geographic footprint, with production facilities in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Australia and Africa. Through our reportable segments, we serve a global customer base across multiple markets through a combination of direct sales and third-party distribution channels. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial, industrial and government customers.\nWe employ a comprehensive set of tools that we refer to as CBS. CBS is our business management system. It is a repeatable, teachable process that we use to create superior value for our customers, shareholders and associates. Rooted in our core values, it is our culture. CBS provides the tools and techniques to ensure that we are continuously improving our ability to meet or exceed customer requirements on a consistent basis.\nOutlook\nWe believe that we are well positioned to grow our businesses organically over the long term by enhancing our product offerings and expanding our customer base. Our business mix is expected to be well balanced between long- and short-cycle businesses, sales in emerging markets and developed nations and fore- and aftermarket products and services. Given this balance, management does not use indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. Instead, the individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and outlook for the future.\nWe face a number of challenges and opportunities, including the successful integration of new acquisitions, application and expansion of our CBS tools to improve margins and working capital management, rationalization of assets and back office functions, and consolidation of manufacturing facilities.\nWe expect to continue to grow as a result of strategic acquisitions. We believe that the extensive experience of our leadership team in acquiring and effectively integrating acquisition targets should enable us to capitalize on opportunities in the future.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of Results of Operations addresses the comparison of the periods presented. The Company's management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon Net sales and segment operating income (loss), which represents Operating income (loss) before Restructuring and other related charges.\nItems Affecting Comparability of Reported Results\nOur financial performance and growth are driven by many factors, principally our ability to serve global markets, fluctuations in the relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, general economic conditions, the global economy and capital spending levels, the availability of capital, our estimates concerning the availability of insurance proceeds to cover asbestos litigation expense and liabilities, the amount of asbestos liabilities and litigation expense, the impact of restructuring initiatives, our ability to pass cost increases on through pricing, the impact of sales mix, and our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions. These key factors have impacted our results of operations in the past and are likely to affect them in the future.\nGlobal Operations\nOur products and services are available worldwide. The manner in which our products and services are sold differs by region. During 2015, approximately 74% of our sales were shipped to locations outside of the U.S. Accordingly, we are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic and political factors in countries throughout the world. Our ability to grow and our financial performance will be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations, including efficiently utilizing our global sales, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, the expansion of market opportunities in Asia, successfully completing global strategic acquisitions and engineering innovative new product applications for end users in a variety of geographic markets. However, we believe that our geographic, end market and product diversification may limit the impact that any one country or economy could have on our consolidated results.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nA significant portion of our Net sales, approximately 72% for the year ended December 31, 2015, is derived from operations outside the U.S., with the majority of those sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because much of our manufacturing and employee costs are outside the U.S., a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion.\nIn February 2015, the Venezuelan government introduced a marginal foreign exchange system ( SIMADI\u201d) which replaces an auction-based foreign exchange system that began operating on March 24, 2015 ( SICAD II\u201d), which we previously used to remeasure our Venezuelan operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we have determined the SIMADI to be the most appropriate rate with which to remeasure or Venezuelan operations from the multiple current legal mechanisms in Venezuela to exchange currency. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, our Venezuelan operation represented less than 1% of our Total assets and Net sales. The foreign currency transaction loss recognized related to the adoption of the SIMADI did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe lift of currency controls in Argentina in December 2015 has caused the Argentine peso to devalue relative to the U.S. dollar. We may be subject to additional foreign currency losses depending on whether Argentina further devalues the peso. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, our Argentine operations represented less than 1% of our Total assets and approximately 2% of our Net sales.\nWe expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to continue to negatively impact our overall results of operations in 2016 as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.\nEconomic Conditions\nDemand for our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance by our customers. The level of capital expenditures depends, in turn, on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. While demand can be cyclical, we believe that our diversified operations generally limit the impact of a downturn in any one market on our consolidated results. However, we are currently in the midst of a sustained decline in commodity prices, including oil, which has had a negative impact on the levels of capital invested and maintenance expenditures by certain of our customers which in turn has reduced the demand for our products and services.\nSeasonality\nAs our gas- and fluid-handling customers seek to fully utilize capital spending budgets before the end of the year, historically our shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter. Also, all of our European operations typically experience a slowdown during the July and August and December holiday season. General economic conditions may, however, impact future seasonal variations.\nPricing\nWe believe our customers place a premium on quality, reliability, availability, design and application engineering support. Our highly engineered gas- and fluid-handling products typically have higher margins than products with commodity-like qualities. However, we are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for components and raw materials including steel, iron, copper and aluminum. Historically, we have been generally successful in passing raw material price increases on to our customers. While we seek to take actions to manage this risk, including commodity hedging where appropriate, such increased costs may adversely impact earnings.\nSales and Cost Mix\nOur profit margins vary in relation to the relative mix of many factors, including the type of product, the geographic location in which the product is manufactured, the end market for which the product is designed, and the percentage of total revenue represented by consumables and aftermarket sales and services. Consumables are generally sold at lower margins in comparison to our foremarket products and equipment, whereas our aftermarket business, including spare parts and other value added services, is generally a higher margin business.\nThe mix of sales was as follows for the periods presented:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foremarket and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aftermarket and consumables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStrategic Acquisitions\nWe complement our organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions can significantly affect our reported results and can complicate period to period comparisons of results. As a consequence, we report the change in our Net sales between periods both from existing and acquired businesses. Orders and order backlog are presented only for the gas- and fluid-handling segment, where this information is relevant. The change in Net sales due to acquisitions represents the change in sales due to the following acquisitions:\nGas and Fluid Handling\nOn July 9, 2013, Colfax completed the acquisition of the common stock of Clarus for $13.2 million, which included the fair value of an estimated additional contingent cash payment of $2.5 million at the acquisition date. The additional contingent payment would be paid during the year ending December 31, 2016 subject to the achievement of certain performance goals. However, we do not expect the performance goals to be achieved. Clarus is a domestic supplier of flushing services for marine applications primarily to U.S. government agencies, with primary operations based in Bellingham, Washington.\nOn September 30, 2013, the Company completed the acquisitions of TLT-Babcock and Alphair for an aggregate purchase price of $55.7 million. TLT-Babcock and Alphair are suppliers of heavy duty and industrial fans in Akron, Ohio and Winnipeg, Manitoba, respectively.\nOn November 1, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of \u010cKDK for $69.4 million, including the assumption of debt. \u010cKDK is a leading supplier of multi-stage centrifugal compressors to the oil & gas, petrochemical, power and steel industries, based in Prague, Czech Republic.\nOn November 25, 2013, the Company increased its ownership of Sicelub, previously a less than wholly owned subsidiary in which the Company did not have a controlling interest, from 44% to 100%. Sicelub provides flushing services to Central and South American customers primarily in the oil, gas and petrochemical end market.\nOn November 29, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of GII for $246.0 million, including the assumption of debt, subject to certain adjustments. GII has operations around the world and expanded the Company's product offerings in the heavy duty industrial and cooling fan market.\nOn June 30, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Roots for $180.7 million. Roots is a leading supplier of blower and compressor technologies which service a broad range of end markets, including wastewater treatment, chemical production, and power generation. The acquisition builds on Howden's global strength in compressors and blowers and adds important application expertise and product solutions to the portfolio.\nOn October 5, 2015, Colfax completed the acquisition of Simsmart for cash consideration of $15.3 million, net of cash acquired. Simsmart provides a software product that controls ventilation conditions and increases fan efficiency. The acquisition of Simsmart expands the Howden product portfolio primarily within the mining end market and other end markets with challenging ventilation conditions.\nFabrication Technology\nOn April 14, 2014, Colfax completed the Victor Acquisition for net cash consideration of $948.8 million, subject to certain adjustments. Victor is a pre-eminent global manufacturer of cutting, gas control and specialty welding solutions. The acquisition complemented the geographic footprint of our fabrication technology segment and expanded our product portfolio into new applications.\nSales, Orders and Backlog\nOur Net sales increased from $4.2 billion in 2013 to $4.6 billion in 2014. In 2015, our Net sales decreased to $4.0 billion. The following table presents the components of changes in consolidated Net sales and, for our gas- and fluid-handling segment, orders and order backlog:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td>

businesses during 2015 compared to 2014 was attributable to decreases of $170.3 million and $134.2 million in our gas- and fluid-handling and fabrication technology segments, respectively. Orders, net of cancellations, from existing businesses for our gas- and fluid-handling segment decreased during 2015 in comparison to 2014 due to declining demand in all end markets from unfavorable domestic and international macroeconomic conditions.\nThe decrease in Net sales from existing businesses during 2014 compared to 2013 was attributable to decreases of $47.7 million and $31.3 million in our fabrication technology and gas- and fluid-handling segments, respectively. Orders, net of cancellations, from existing businesses for our gas- and fluid-handling segment were flat during 2014 in comparison to 2013 as declines in demand from the oil, gas and petrochemical, power generation and mining end markets were offset by growth in demand from the marine and general industrial and other end markets.\nBusiness Segments\nAs discussed further above, the Company reports results in two reportable segments: gas and fluid handling and fabrication technology. The following table summarizes Net sales by reportable segment for each of the following periods:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas and Fluid Handling\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,981.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,329.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,104.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fabrication Technology\n</td> <td>1,985.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,294.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,103.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,967.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,624.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,207.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas and Fluid Handling\nWe design, manufacture, install and maintain gas- and fluid-handling products for use in a wide range of markets, including power generation, oil, gas and petrochemical, mining, marine (including defense) and general industrial and other. Our gas-handling products are principally marketed under the Howden brand name. Howden's primary products are heavy-duty fans, rotary heat exchangers and compressors. The fans and heat exchangers are used in coal-fired and other types of power stations, both in combustion and emissions control applications, underground mines, steel sintering plants and other industrial facilities that require movement of large volumes of air in harsh applications. Howden's compressors are mainly used in the oil, gas and petrochemical end market. Our fluid-handling products are marketed by Colfax Fluid Handling under a portfolio of brands including Allweiler and Imo. Colfax Fluid Handling is a supplier of a broad range of fluid-handling products, including pumps, fluid-handling systems and controls, and specialty valves.\nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for our gas- and fluid-handling segment:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,981.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,329.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,104.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>594.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>696.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other related charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>399.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of Net sales\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>194.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income margin\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $170.3 million Net sales decrease due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2015 in comparison to 2014 was primarily due to declines in the power generation, mining, and general industrial and other end markets, partially offset by growth in the marine and oil, gas, and petrochemical end markets. Additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $225.4 million, partially offset by acquisition related growth of $47.9 million. Gross profit decreased during 2015, which was primarily the result of changes in foreign exchange rates and lower volumes. Gross profit margin increased during 2015 in comparison to 2014 as improved margins through cost control and restructuring savings were more than sufficient to offset the impact of lower volumes. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2015 primarily due to accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess in the cost structure of the Company in response to the current challenging, cyclical economic conditions. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2015 decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates, cost control activities and the impact of lower volumes, partially offset by acquisition-related growth, $8.1 million of charges associated with uncollectible accounts of a specific customer in South America, $2.8 million of asset impairment charges which includes a $1.7 million impairment loss related to a finite-lived intangible asset, approximately $8.0 million of transaction costs and year-one amortization charges associated with 2015 acquisitions, and a $4.1 million charge for revaluation of net asbestos-related liabilities. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes a $13.4 million impairment loss related to identifiable intangible assets, a $4.0 million loss on disposition of a small fluid-handling business line and a $1.3 million foreign currency loss from the use of the SICAD II exchange rate at our Venezuelan fluid-handling business, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $2.9 million related to the Clarus contingent payment liability.\nThe $31.3 million Net sales decrease due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2014 in comparison to 2013 was primarily due to declines in the oil, gas and petrochemical, power generation and marine end markets, partially offset by growth in the mining and general industrial and other end markets. Additionally, Net sales increased by $287.9 million due to acquisitions and changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $31.0 million. Gross profit increased during 2014 reflecting the impact of acquisitions. Gross profit margin increased during 2014 in comparison to 2013 as improved margins through cost control and restructuring savings in our gas-handling business were more than sufficient to offset the lower margins of the acquired entities. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2014 primarily due to an increase in restructuring actions to reduce structural costs and integrate the acquisitions made during the fourth quarter of 2013. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a $66.3 million increase due to acquisitions and the specific 2014 charges discussed previously.\nFabrication Technology\nWe formulate, develop, manufacture and supply consumable products and equipment for use in the cutting and joining of steels, aluminum and other metals and metal alloys. Our fabrication technology products are marketed under several brand names, most notably ESAB and Victor, which we believe are well known in the international cutting and welding industry. ESAB's comprehensive range of cutting and welding consumables includes electrodes, cored and solid wire and fluxes. ESAB's fabrication technology equipment ranges from portable welding machines to large customized cutting and automated welding systems. The Victor Acquisition complemented the geographic footprint of our fabrication technology segment and expanded our cutting equipment and consumables, gas control and specialty welding product lines. Products are sold into a wide range of end markets, including oil & gas, power generation, wind power, shipbuilding, pipelines, mobile/off-highway equipment and mining.\nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for our fabrication technology segment:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,985.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,294.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,103.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>657.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>782.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>679.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other related charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>459.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>516.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>459.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of Net sales\n</td> <td>23.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income margin\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Net sales decrease during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in existing businesses of $134.2 million and changes in foreign exchange rates which had a negative impact of $298.7 million, partially offset by acquisition-related growth of $123.3 million. The $134.2 million Net sales decline due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2015 in comparison to 2014 was primarily the result of decreases in equipment sales and consumable volumes in most regions. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2015 decreased reflecting changes in foreign exchange rates, lower volumes, mix impact from oil and gas and lower overall capital equipment spending. The decrease in Selling, general and administrative expense during 2015 was primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates, cost control activities and the impact of lower volumes, partially offset by an acquisition-related increase of $24.1 million, and a $1.5 million impairment loss related to an identifiable intangible asset during 2015. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes a $5.0 million loss from the use of the SICAD II exchange rate at our Venezuelan fabrication technology business, which did not repeat in 2015.\nThe $191.7 million Net sales increase during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of acquisition-related growth of $347.3 million, partially offset by changes in foreign exchange rates which had a negative impact of $107.9 million. The $47.7 million Net sales decline due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2014 in comparison to 2013 was primarily the result of decreases in consumable volumes in most geographies. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2014 increased reflecting the positive impact of cost control activities. Additionally, Gross profit and gross profit margin during 2014 were positively impacted by the higher gross margins at Victor, which were partially offset by acquisition-related inventory step up expense of $9.0 million. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expense during 2014 was primarily due to an acquisition-related increase of $95.5 million and the foreign currency loss at our Venezuelan fabrication technology business discussed previously.\nGross Profit - Total Company\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,251.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,478.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,306.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $227.0 million decrease in Gross profit during 2015 in comparison to 2014 was attributable to decreases of $102.3 million and $124.7 million in our gas- and fluid-handling segment and our fabrication technology segment, respectively. The decrease in gross profit in both of our segments during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates and lower overall volumes, partially offset by acquisition related growth. The increase in gross profit margin in our gas- and fluid-handling segment during 2015 as compared to 2014 was more than offset by the lower gross profit margin at fabrication technology. Changes in foreign exchange rates during 2015 had a $169.0 million negative impact on Gross profit.\nThe $172.6 million increase in Gross profit during 2014 in comparison to 2013 was attributable to increases of $70.0 million and $102.6 million in our gas- and fluid-handling segment and our fabrication technology segment, respectively. The increase in gross profit margin in both of our segments during 2014 reflects the positive impact of cost control activities. Additionally, our fabrication technology segment was positively impacted during 2014 by the higher gross margins of Victor, which were partially offset by acquisition-related inventory step up expense. The increase in Gross profit in our gas- and fluid-handling segment during 2014 includes the impact of acquisitions, which also served to reduce gross profit margin. Changes in foreign exchange rates during 2014 had a $44.0 million negative impact on Gross profit.\nOperating Expenses - Total Company\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>906.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,011.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of Net sales\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other related charges\n</td> <td>61.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $105.2 million during 2015 in comparison to 2014. Changes in foreign exchange rates during 2015 decreased Selling, general, and administrative expenses by primarily $111.3 million. An overall decrease in acquisition integration costs and the positive benefit of restructuring actions to reduce structural costs and integrate acquisitions also contributed to the decrease. These items were partially offset by a $40.4 million acquisition-related increase in Selling, general and administrative expense during 2015. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2015 includes an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of specific South American customers of $9.4 million, asset impairment charges of $4.3 million, and transaction costs and year-one amortization of approximately $8.0 million, as discussed previously. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of Net sales increased primarily as a result of lower Net sales driven by reasons discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes a $13.4 million impairment loss related to identifiable intangible assets, a $4.0 million loss on disposition of a small fluid-handling business line and a $6.3 million loss from the use of the SICAD II exchange rate at our Venezuelan businesses. The increase in Restructuring and other related charges during 2015 is attributable to our gas- and fluid-handling segment due to accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess in the cost structure of the Company in response to the current challenging, cyclical economic conditions.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $146.9 million during 2014 in comparison to 2013 primarily due to an increase of $161.8 million attributable to the addition of the operations associated with the Victor Acquisition and the gas- and fluid-handling acquisitions during 2013. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes the specific charges discussed above associated with impairment, loss on disposition of a business line and foreign currency, partially offset by significant cost saving programs in both segments and an unrealized gain of $2.9 million related to the Clarus contingent payment liability, as the performance criteria are no longer expected to be met. Restructuring and other related charges increased compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in restructuring actions to reduce structural costs and integrate the acquisitions made during 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013.\nInterest Expense - Total Company\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in Interest expense during 2015 was primarily due to decreases in weighted average interest rates, outstanding borrowing levels and amortization of deferred financing fees and original issue discount. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.7 million write-off of certain deferred financings fees during 2015 in connection with the refinancing of our principal credit facility.\nThe decrease in Interest expense during 2014 was primarily attributable to the amendments to the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement (as defined and further discussed in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Borrowing Arrangements\") during 2013. During 2013, $29.4 million of certain deferred fees and original issue discount were written-off in connection with the amendments which reduced future accretion to Interest expense and did not reoccur in 2014. Additionally, the favorable impact of lower borrowing rates reduced Interest expense by $13.7 million and the lesser accretion of deferred fees and original issue discount decreased Interest expense by $6.2 million, which were also attributable to the amendments in 2013. A reduction of $3.1 million is included in Interest expense due to the change in expected settlement under the conditions specified in the contract of the mandatorily redeemable non-voting preferred stock of Sicelub, as the performance criteria were not met.\nProvision for Income Taxes - Total Company\nIncome before income taxes was $236.9 million and the Provision for income taxes was $49.7 million for 2015. The Provision for income taxes was impacted by a tax benefit of $13.0 million associated with the resolution of a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and the effect of foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. tax rate.\nIncome before income taxes was $358.2 million and the Benefit from income taxes was $62.0 million for 2014. The Benefit from income taxes was impacted by the reassessment of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets as a result of the effect of the Victor Acquisition on expected future U.S. income. This reassessment resulted in a decrease in the Company's valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. The reduction in the valuation allowance created a non-cash income tax benefit for 2014 of $145.4 million. Additionally, a tax benefit of $21.8 million was included in Benefit from income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income during 2014 associated with the resolution of a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. These items, as well as the impact of foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. tax rate, are the principal reasons for a tax benefit rather than a tax provision, which would result from the application of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the reported Income before income taxes for 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nHistorically, we have financed our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuances of equity. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital, funding of acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, asbestos-related cash outflows and funding of our pension plans. If additional funds are needed for strategic acquisitions or other corporate purposes, we believe we could raise additional funds in the form of debt or equity.\nEquity Capital\nOn May 13, 2013, we sold 7,500,000 shares of newly issued Colfax Common stock to underwriters for public resale pursuant to a shelf registration statement for an aggregate purchase price of $331.9 million. In conjunction with this issuance, we recognized $12.0 million in equity issuance costs which were recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital during 2013.\nWe entered into a Conversion Agreement with the BDT Investor, pursuant to which the BDT Investor exercised its option to convert 13,877,552 shares of Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock into 12,173,291 shares of the Company's Common stock plus cash in lieu of a .22807018 share interest, which conversion occurred on February 12, 2014. As consideration for the BDT Investor's agreement to exercise its optional conversion right, the Company paid approximately $23.4 million to the BDT\nInvestor, of which $19.6 million represents the Preferred stock conversion inducement payment in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2014.\nOn February 20, 2014, we sold 9,200,000 shares of newly issued Colfax Common stock to underwriters for public resale pursuant to the shelf registration statement for an aggregate purchase price of $632.5 million. In conjunction with this issuance, we recognized $22.1 million in equity issuance costs, which were recorded as a reduction in Additional paid-in capital during 2014.\nWe contributed 66,000 shares, 183,000 shares, and 88,200 shares of newly issued Colfax Common stock to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan on May 21, 2015, January 15, 2014 and September 12, 2013, respectively.\nOn October 11, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the Company's Common stock from time-to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program is authorized until December 31, 2016. The timing and amount of shares repurchased is to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. During the fourth quarter of 2015 the Company repurchased 986,279 shares of the Company's Common stock in open market transactions through the close of business on December 31, 2015. From January 1, 2016 through February 3, 2016, the Company has repurchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company's Common stock under a 10b5-1 Plan. As of February 4, 2016, the remaining stock repurchase authorization provided by the Company's Board of Directors is approximately $52 million.\nBorrowing Arrangements\nWe entered into a credit agreement by and among the Company, Colfax UK Holdings Ltd, the other subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, the lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent (the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement\u201d) on September 12, 2011. In connection with the Charter Acquisition, the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement was amended on January 13, 2012 and we terminated our existing credit agreement as well as Charter's outstanding indebtedness.\nWe entered into a Second and Third amendment to the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement on February 22, 2013 and November 7, 2013, respectively, which, among other things, reallocated our borrowing capacities of the tranches of loans and reduced our interest rate margins when compared to the terms of the amended Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement on January 13, 2012. In conjunction with the 2013 amendments, we recorded a charge to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $29.4 million to write-off certain deferred financing fees and original issue discount and expensed approximately $1.2 million of costs incurred in connection with the refinancing.\nOn May 14, 2014, we entered into an Incremental Amendment to the Term A-1 facility under the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, to increase the borrowing capacity of the Term A-1 facility by $150.0 million, upon the same terms as the existing Term A-1 facility.\nOn June 5, 2015, we entered into the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the loans under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement were used by us to repay in full balances under our preexisting Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. The 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement consists of a term loan in an aggregate amount of $750.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d) and a revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d), each of which matures in five years. The Revolver contains a $50.0 million swing line loan sub-facility.\nOn September 25, 2015, we entered into an Increase Agreement, as provided for under the terms of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. Under the Increase Agreement, we increased the Revolver by $300.0 million, resulting in a total Revolver commitment under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement of $1.3 billion. The Term Loan and the Revolver bear interest, at the election of the Company, at either the base rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement) or the Eurocurrency rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement), in each case, plus the applicable interest rate margin.\nThe Term Loan and the Revolver bear interest, at the election of the Company, at either the base rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement) or the Eurocurrency rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement), in each case, plus the applicable interest rate margin. The Term Loan and the Revolver initially bear interest either at the Eurocurrency rate plus 1.50% or at the base rate plus 0.50% , and in future quarters will bear interest either at the Eurocurrency rate or the base rate plus the applicable interest rate margin based upon either, whichever results in the lower applicable interest rate margin (subject to certain exceptions), the Company's total leverage ratio and the corporate family rating of the Company as determined by Standard & Poor's and Moody's (ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% , in the case of the Eurocurrency margin, and 0.25% to 1.00% , in the case\nof the base rate margin). Swing line loans bear interest at the applicable rate, as specified under the terms of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, based upon the currency borrowed.\nIn conjunction with the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, we recorded a charge to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $4.7 million to write-off certain deferred financing fees and original issue discount and expensed approximately $0.4 million of costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. The Company had an original issue discount of $7.5 million and deferred financing fees of $8.1 million included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, which will be accreted to Interest expense primarily using the effective interest method, over the life of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted-average interest rate of borrowings under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement was 1.83%, excluding accretion of original issue discount and amortization of deferred financing fees, and there was $688.8 million available on the revolving credit facility.\nWe are also party to additional letter of credit facilities with total capacity of $718.8 million. Total letters of credit of $360.4 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nOn December 22, 2014, we entered into a receivables financing facility, pursuant to which we established a wholly owned, special purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary which purchases trade receivables from certain of our subsidiaries on an ongoing basis and pledges them to support its obligation as borrower under the receivables financing facility. This special purpose subsidiary has a separate legal existence from its parent and its assets are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of the selling subsidiaries or any other member of the consolidated group. Availability of funds may fluctuate over time given changes in eligible receivable balances, but will not exceed the program limit. On December 21, 2015, the Company increased the receivables financing facility by $15 million to $95 million and extended the facility through December 20, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the total outstanding borrowings under the receivables financing facility were $75.8 million and the interest rate was 1.2%. The scheduled termination date for the receivables financing facility may be extended from time to time. The facility contains representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities customary for facilities of this type. The facility does not contain any covenants that we view as materially constraining to the activities of our business.\nCertain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company have agreed to guarantee the obligations of the Company under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. The 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt or liens, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, make investments or pay dividends. In addition, the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio, as defined therein, of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 and minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined therein, of 3.0 to 1.0, measured at the end of each quarter. The 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement contains various events of default (including failure to comply with the covenants under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement and related agreements) and upon an event of default the lenders may, subject to various customary cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan and the Revolver. The Company is in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2015. We believe that our sources of liquidity, including the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, are adequate to fund our operations for the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $197.4 million of Cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $108.0 million from $305.4 million as of December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes the change in Cash and cash equivalents during the periods indicated:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>303.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of fixed assets, net\n</td> <td>(69.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions, net of cash received\n</td> <td>(196.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(948.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(372.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans to non-trade creditors\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(247.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,030.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(475.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Repayments of) proceeds from borrowings, net\n</td> <td>(88.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(309.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from issuance of common stock, net\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>613.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchases of common stock\n</td> <td>(27.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of shares held by noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock conversion inducement payment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other uses\n</td> <td>(21.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(131.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(33.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(108.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(171.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in working capital and the timing of payments for items such as pension funding and asbestos-related costs.

During 2014, net working capital increased by $16.7 million primarily due to seasonal increases in receivables and decreases in payables, partially offset by a decrease in inventory as we reduced the high inventory levels attributable to the Victor Acquisition, which reduced our cash flows from operating activities. During 2013, net working capital decreased by $110 million, primarily due to a decrease in inventory from our CBS initiatives and an increase in payables associated with the timing of year-end purchases partially offset by the seasonal increase in receivables, which increased our cash flows from operating activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cash flows from investing activities during 2015 were impacted by the net cash outflows of $180.7 million associated with the Roots Acquisition and $15.3 million for the Simsmart acquisition. Cash flows from investing activities during 2014 were impacted by the net cash outflows of $948.8 million associated with the Victor Acquisition. During 2013, the acquisitions of GII, Clarus, \u010cKDK, TLT-Babcock, Alphair and Sicelub resulted in net cash outflows of $399.9 million.\nCash flows from financing activities during 2015 were impacted by the refinancing of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement further discussed under \"-Borrowing Arrangements\" above. Additionally, cash flows from financing activities during 2015 were impacted by the share repurchases discussed under -Equity Capital\u201d.\nCash flows from financing activities during 2014 were impacted by the funding of the Victor Acquisition. The Victor Acquisition was funded through net proceeds of $610.4 million from the sale of newly issued Common stock and $338.4 million of borrowings under our Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. Cash flows from financing activities during 2014 were also impacted by the conversion of the Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock further discussed above under -Equity Capital.\u201d Cash flows from financing activities for 2013 were impacted by the amendments to the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement further discussed above under -Borrowing Arrangements\u201d and the May 2013 sale of newly issued Common stock further discussed above under -Equity Capital.\u201d The sale of our Common stock in May 2013 generated $319.9 million cash inflows from financing activities.\nCash flows from financing activities were also impacted by acquisitions of shares of less than wholly owned subsidiaries. During 2014, cash flows from financing activities included the $10.3 million acquisition of the remaining ownership of Svel and Howden Middle East. During 2013, cash flows from financing activities included a $14.9 million acquisition of common and investment shares of Soldex resulting in an increase in our ownership of the subsidiary from approximately 91% to 99%.\nOur Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 included $186.9 million held in jurisdictions outside the U.S., which may be subject to tax penalties if repatriated into the U.S. and other restrictions.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,411.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,426.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>351.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,477.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,042.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Variable interest payments are estimated using a static rate of 1.83%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Excludes open purchase orders for goods or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which is not certain.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have funding requirements associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2015, which are estimated to be $34.9 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. Other long-term liabilities, such as those for asbestos and other legal claims, employee benefit plan obligations, deferred income taxes and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount.\nOn December 25, 2015, the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a subsidiary was redeemed and settled by offset of the outstanding loan payable to the Company by the holders of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015 other than outstanding letters of credit of $360.4 million, unconditional purchase obligations with suppliers of $351.4 million, and $141.3 million of future operating lease payments.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have in the past divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, certain representations, warranties and indemnities were made to purchasers to cover various risks or unknown liabilities. We cannot estimate the potential liability, if any, that may result from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown and unexpected contingencies; however, we do not believe that any such liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our evaluation of business and macroeconomic trends and information from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nAsbestos Liabilities and Insurance Assets\nCertain subsidiaries are each one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos. Such components were acquired from third-party suppliers, and were not manufactured by any of the Company's subsidiaries nor were the subsidiaries producers or direct suppliers of asbestos. The manufactured products that are alleged to have contained asbestos generally were provided to meet the specifications of the subsidiaries' customers, including the U.S. Navy.\nWe have projected each subsidiary's future asbestos-related liability costs with regard to pending and future unasserted claims based upon the Nicholson methodology. The Nicholson methodology is a standard approach used by experts and has been accepted by numerous courts. This methodology is based upon risk equations, exposed population estimates, mortality rates, and other demographic statistics. In applying the Nicholson methodology for each subsidiary we performed: (1) an analysis of the estimated population likely to have been exposed or claim to have been exposed to products manufactured by the subsidiaries based upon national studies undertaken of the population of workers believed to have been exposed to asbestos; (2) a review of epidemiological and demographic studies to estimate the number of potentially exposed people that would be likely to develop asbestos-related diseases in each year; (3) an analysis of the subsidiaries' recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates for these diseases and (4) an analysis of the historical asbestos liability costs to develop average values, which vary by disease type, jurisdiction and the nature of claim, to determine an estimate of costs likely to be associated with currently pending and projected asbestos claims. Our projections, based upon the Nicholson methodology, estimate both claims and the estimated cash outflows related to the resolution of such claims for periods up to and including the endpoint of asbestos studies referred to in item (2) above. It is our policy to record a liability for asbestos-related liability costs for the longest period of time that we can reasonably estimate. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years.\nProjecting future asbestos-related liability costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict, including, among others, the number of claims that might be received, the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the latency period associated with asbestos exposure, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the financial resources of other companies that are co-defendants in the claims, funds available in post-bankruptcy trusts, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, including fluctuations in the timing of court actions and rulings, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards, including potential tort reform. Furthermore, any projections with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. These trend factors have both positive and negative effects on the dynamics of asbestos litigation in the tort system and the related best estimate of our asbestos liability, and these effects do not move in linear fashion but rather change over multiple year periods. Accordingly, we monitor these trend factors over time and periodically assess whether an alternative forecast period is appropriate. Taking these factors into account and the inherent uncertainties, we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims that will be resolved in the next 15 years and have recorded that liability as our best estimate. While it is reasonably possible that the subsidiaries will incur costs after this period, we do not believe the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss is estimable at the current time. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years. Defense costs associated with asbestos-related liabilities as well as costs incurred related to litigation against the subsidiaries' insurers are expensed as incurred.\nWe assessed the subsidiaries' existing insurance arrangements and agreements, estimated the applicability of insurance coverage for existing and expected future claims, analyzed publicly available information bearing on the current creditworthiness\nand solvency of the various insurers, and employed such insurance allocation methodologies as we believed appropriate to ascertain the probable insurance recoveries for asbestos liabilities. The analysis took into account self-insurance retentions, policy exclusions, pending litigation, liability caps and gaps in coverage, existing and potential insolvencies of insurers as well as how legal and defense costs will be covered under the insurance policies.\nEach subsidiary has separate insurance coverage acquired prior to our ownership of each independent entity. In our evaluation of the insurance asset, we use differing insurance allocation methodologies for each subsidiary based upon the applicable law pertaining to the affected subsidiary.\nManagement's analyses are based on currently known facts and a number of assumptions. However, projecting future events, such as new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of resolving each claim, coverage issues among layers of insurers, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, the continuing solvency of various insurance companies, the amount of remaining insurance available, as well as the numerous uncertainties inherent in asbestos litigation could cause the actual liabilities and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than those projected or recorded which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nSee Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our asbestos liabilities and insurance assets.\nRetirement Benefits\nPension obligations and other post-retirement benefits are actuarially determined and are affected by several assumptions, including the discount rate, assumed annual rates of return on plan assets, and per capita cost of covered health care benefits. Changes in discount rate and differences from actual results for each assumption will affect the amounts of pension expense and other post-retirement expense recognized in future periods. These assumptions may also have an effect on the amount and timing of future cash contributions. See Note 13, Defined Benefit Plans\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired associated with our acquisitions.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit or asset exceeds its implied fair value.\nIn the evaluation of Goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting entity is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the reporting entity's fair value is performed and compared to the carrying value of that entity. In certain instances, we may skip the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the first step of the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and step two of the impairment analysis is performed. In step two of the analysis, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's Goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise.\nWe measure fair value of reporting units based on a present value of future discounted cash flows and a market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that the reporting units are expected to generate in the future. Significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: the weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the Company against certain market information. Significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying appropriate market multiples and assessing earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.\nDuring 2015, based on the results of the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, we concluded based on a preponderance of positive indicators and the weight of such indicators that the fair values of our Fluid Handling, Howden Compressors and Howden Heavy Fans & Heaters reporting units are more likely than not greater than their respective carrying amounts and as a result, quantitative analyses would not be needed. Therefore, no further testing of goodwill for impairment was performed for these reporting units.\nFor our Fabrication Technology reporting unit, we noted unfavorable domestic and international economic trends, particularly trading volumes, which are driven by overall macroeconomic conditions within the welding industry. As such, we did not perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill for our Fabrication Technology reporting unit and proceeded directly to performing the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for 2015. Our quantitative impairment assessment of Goodwill associated with the Fabrication Technology reporting unit, based on the methodologies identified above, resulted in a calculated fair value that exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. Although we believe our calculated fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit by a reasonably sufficient amount, future deterioration in our performance or continued decline in demand from the fabrication technology end markets that we serve could result in a lower projected fair value in future periods.\nThe annual Goodwill impairment analysis performed as of September 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 indicated no impairment to be present.\nIn the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying value, a calculation is performed and compared to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We measure the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief from royalty\u201d method. Significant estimates in this approach include projected revenues and royalty and discount rates for each trade name evaluated.\nFrom time-to-time, we have identified certain indefinite-lived intangible assets that, due to indicators present at the specific operation associated with the indefinite-lived intangible asset, should be tested for impairment prior to our annual impairment evaluation. During 2015, an analysis was performed to evaluate certain intangible assets related to a specific operation within the Company due to a decline in anticipated performance at the operation associated with those assets. The analysis determined an indefinite-lived trade name within the Company's fabrication technology segment was impaired based upon relief from royalty measurements and resulted in a $1.5 million impairment loss calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value as of the date of the impairment test. The impairment loss was included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2015.\nDuring 2014, an analysis was performed on a trade name related to a specific operation within the gas- and fluid-handling segment prior to the annual impairment analysis due to the decision to substantially reduce its operations. The analysis determined the trade name was no longer recoverable based upon relief from royalty measurements and resulted in a $2.9 million impairment loss included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2014.\nThe annual impairment analysis performed as of September 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 indicated no impairment to be present, except for $0.2 million of impairment loss related to an indefinite-lived intangible asset included in the gas- and fluid-handling segment for the year ended December 31, 2013. This impairment results from a decline in anticipated revenue related to this asset. The impairment loss is included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income and was calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset under the relief from royalty method and its carrying value as of the date of the impairment test. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nContinuation of the decline in oil prices increases the risk of impairments next year. Actual results could differ from our estimates and projections, which would also affect the assessment of impairment. As of December 31, 2015, we have Goodwill of $2.8 billion and indefinite lived trade names of $395.3 million that are subject to at least annual review for impairment. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance, we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made.\nAccounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes\u201d prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a position taken in a tax return. Under this standard, we must presume the income tax position will be examined by a relevant tax authority and determine whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. An income tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. Liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are reviewed periodically and are adjusted as events occur that affect our estimates, such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits and, if applicable, the conclusion of any court proceedings. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, were $52.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and are included in Other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue and costs from product sales when title passes to the buyer and all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, there are no further obligations to customers, and collectibility is probable. Product delivery occurs when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer. Our shipping terms vary based on the contract. If any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Any customer allowances and discounts are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the sales price for the products sold. These allowances and discounts are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to service agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement.\nWe recognize revenue and cost of sales on gas-handling long-term contracts using the percentage of completion method\u201d in accordance with GAAP. Under this method, contract revenues are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Any recognized revenues that have not been billed to a customer are recorded as a component of Trade receivables and any billings of customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as a component of Accounts payable. As of December 31, 2015, there were $149.5 million of revenues in excess of billings and $146.3 million of billings in excess of revenues on long-term contracts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe have contracts in various stages of completion. Such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition. Significant management judgments and estimates, including estimated costs to complete projects, must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized during each period. Current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available. The revisions are recorded in income in the period in which they are determined using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire pool of customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $39.5 million and $27.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The current year increase was primarily driven by an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of specific South American customers of $9.4 million.

As consideration for the BDT Investor's agreement to exercise its optional conversion right, the Company paid approximately $23.4 million to the BDT\nOur profit margins vary in relation to the relative mix of many factors, including the type of product, the geographic location in which the product is manufactured, the end market for which the product is designed, and the percentage of total revenue represented by consumables and aftermarket sales and services. Consumables are generally sold at lower margins in comparison to our foremarket products and equipment, whereas our aftermarket business, including spare parts and other value added services, is generally a higher margin business.\nFrom time-to-time, we have identified certain indefinite-lived intangible assets that, due to indicators present at the specific operation associated with the indefinite-lived intangible asset, should be tested for impairment prior to our annual impairment evaluation. During 2015, an analysis was performed to evaluate certain intangible assets related to a specific operation within the Company due to a decline in anticipated performance at the operation associated with those assets. The analysis determined an indefinite-lived trade name within the Company's fabrication technology segment was impaired based upon relief from royalty measurements and resulted in a $1.5 million impairment loss calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value as of the date of the impairment test. The impairment loss was included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2015.\nThe Net sales decrease during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in existing businesses of $134.2 million and changes in foreign exchange rates which had a negative impact of $298.7 million, partially offset by acquisition-related growth of $123.3 million. The $134.2 million Net sales decline due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2015 in comparison to 2014 was primarily the result of decreases in equipment sales and consumable volumes in most regions. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2015 decreased reflecting changes in foreign exchange rates, lower volumes, mix impact from oil and gas and lower overall capital equipment spending. The decrease in Selling, general and administrative expense during 2015 was primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates, cost control activities and the impact of lower volumes, partially offset by an acquisition-related increase of $24.1 million, and a $1.5 million impairment loss related to an identifiable intangible asset during 2015. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes a $5.0 million loss from the use of the SICAD II exchange rate at our Venezuelan fabrication technology business, which did not repeat in 2015.\nRetirement Benefits\nThe annual Goodwill impairment analysis performed as of September 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 indicated no impairment to be present.\n\nAsbestos Liabilities and Insurance Assets\nOn May 14, 2014, we entered into an Incremental Amendment to the Term A-1 facility under the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, to increase the borrowing capacity of the Term A-1 facility by $150.0 million, upon the same terms as the existing Term A-1 facility.\n \u2022 Gas and Fluid Handling - a global supplier of a broad range of gas- and fluid-handling products, including heavy-duty centrifugal and axial fans, rotary heat exchangers, gas compressors, pumps, fluid-handling systems and controls and specialty valves, which serves customers in the power generation, oil, gas and petrochemical, mining, marine (including defense) and general industrial and other end markets; and \nGlobal Operations\nOn October 11, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the Company's Common stock from time-to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program is authorized until December 31, 2016. The timing and amount of shares repurchased is to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. During the fourth quarter of 2015 the Company repurchased 986,279 shares of the Company's Common stock in open market transactions through the close of business on December 31, 2015. From January 1, 2016 through February 3, 2016, the Company has repurchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company's Common stock under a 10b5-1 Plan. As of February 4, 2016, the remaining stock repurchase authorization provided by the Company's Board of Directors is approximately $52 million.\nThe annual impairment analysis performed as of September 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 indicated no impairment to be present, except for $0.2 million of impairment loss related to an indefinite-lived intangible asset included in the gas- and fluid-handling segment for the year ended December 31, 2013. This impairment results from a decline in anticipated revenue related to this asset. The impairment loss is included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income and was calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset under the relief from royalty method and its carrying value as of the date of the impairment test. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nOn November 25, 2013, the Company increased its ownership of Sicelub, previously a less than wholly owned subsidiary in which the Company did not have a controlling interest, from 44% to 100%. Sicelub provides flushing services to Central and South American customers primarily in the oil, gas and petrochemical end market.\nProjecting future asbestos-related liability costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict, including, among others, the number of claims that might be received, the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the latency period associated with asbestos exposure, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the financial resources of other companies that are co-defendants in the claims, funds available in post-bankruptcy trusts, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, including fluctuations in the timing of court actions and rulings, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards, including potential tort reform. Furthermore, any projections with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. These trend factors have both positive and negative effects on the dynamics of asbestos litigation in the tort system and the related best estimate of our asbestos liability, and these effects do not move in linear fashion but rather change over multiple year periods. Accordingly, we monitor these trend factors over time and periodically assess whether an alternative forecast period is appropriate. Taking these factors into account and the inherent uncertainties, we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims that will be resolved in the next 15 years and have recorded that liability as our best estimate. While it is reasonably possible that the subsidiaries will incur costs after this period, we do not believe the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss is estimable at the current time. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years. Defense costs associated with asbestos-related liabilities as well as costs incurred related to litigation against the subsidiaries' insurers are expensed as incurred.\nCash flows from financing activities were also impacted by acquisitions of shares of less than wholly owned subsidiaries. During 2014, cash flows from financing activities included the $10.3 million acquisition of the remaining ownership of Svel and Howden Middle East. During 2013, cash flows from financing activities included a $14.9 million acquisition of common and investment shares of Soldex resulting in an increase in our ownership of the subsidiary from approximately 91% to 99%.\nOn September 25, 2015, we entered into an Increase Agreement, as provided for under the terms of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. Under the Increase Agreement, we increased the Revolver by $300.0 million, resulting in a total Revolver commitment under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement of $1.3 billion. The Term Loan and the Revolver bear interest, at the election of the Company, at either the base rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement) or the Eurocurrency rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement), in each case, plus the applicable interest rate margin.\nof the base rate margin). Swing line loans bear interest at the applicable rate, as specified under the terms of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, based upon the currency borrowed.\nWe believe that we are well positioned to grow our businesses organically over the long term by enhancing our product offerings and expanding our customer base. Our business mix is expected to be well balanced between long- and short-cycle businesses, sales in emerging markets and developed nations and fore- and aftermarket products and services. Given this balance, management does not use indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. Instead, the individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and outlook for the future.\n (1) Variable interest payments are estimated using a static rate of 1.83%. \nThe decrease in Interest expense during 2015 was primarily due to decreases in weighted average interest rates, outstanding borrowing levels and amortization of deferred financing fees and original issue discount. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.7 million write-off of certain deferred financings fees during 2015 in connection with the refinancing of our principal credit facility.\nInvestor, of which $19.6 million represents the Preferred stock conversion inducement payment in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2014.\nSales, Orders and Backlog\nIn February 2015, the Venezuelan government introduced a marginal foreign exchange system ( SIMADI\u201d) which replaces an auction-based foreign exchange system that began operating on March 24, 2015 ( SICAD II\u201d), which we previously used to remeasure our Venezuelan operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we have determined the SIMADI to be the most appropriate rate with which to remeasure or Venezuelan operations from the multiple current legal mechanisms in Venezuela to exchange currency. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, our Venezuelan operation represented less than 1% of our Total assets and Net sales. The foreign currency transaction loss recognized related to the adoption of the SIMADI did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe formulate, develop, manufacture and supply consumable products and equipment for use in the cutting and joining of steels, aluminum and other metals and metal alloys. Our fabrication technology products are marketed under several brand names, most notably ESAB and Victor, which we believe are well known in the international cutting and welding industry. ESAB's comprehensive range of cutting and welding consumables includes electrodes, cored and solid wire and fluxes. ESAB's fabrication technology equipment ranges from portable welding machines to large customized cutting and automated welding systems. The Victor Acquisition complemented the geographic footprint of our fabrication technology segment and expanded our cutting equipment and consumables, gas control and specialty welding product lines. Products are sold into a wide range of end markets, including oil & gas, power generation, wind power, shipbuilding, pipelines, mobile/off-highway equipment and mining.\nThe mix of sales was as follows for the periods presented:\n \u2022 During 2015, 2014 and 2013 cash payments of $57.7 million, $43.5 million and $47.3 million, respectively, were made related to our restructuring initiatives. \nContractual Obligations\nOn February 20, 2014, we sold 9,200,000 shares of newly issued Colfax Common stock to underwriters for public resale pursuant to the shelf registration statement for an aggregate purchase price of $632.5 million. In conjunction with this issuance, we recognized $22.1 million in equity issuance costs, which were recorded as a reduction in Additional paid-in capital during 2014.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015 other than outstanding letters of credit of $360.4 million, unconditional purchase obligations with suppliers of $351.4 million, and $141.3 million of future operating lease payments.\nPension obligations and other post-retirement benefits are actuarially determined and are affected by several assumptions, including the discount rate, assumed annual rates of return on plan assets, and per capita cost of covered health care benefits. Changes in discount rate and differences from actual results for each assumption will affect the amounts of pension expense and other post-retirement expense recognized in future periods. These assumptions may also have an effect on the amount and timing of future cash contributions. See Note 13, Defined Benefit Plans\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our evaluation of business and macroeconomic trends and information from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe face a number of challenges and opportunities, including the successful integration of new acquisitions, application and expansion of our CBS tools to improve margins and working capital management, rationalization of assets and back office functions, and consolidation of manufacturing facilities.\nWe recognize revenue and cost of sales on gas-handling long-term contracts using the percentage of completion method\u201d in accordance with GAAP. Under this method, contract revenues are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Any recognized revenues that have not been billed to a customer are recorded as a component of Trade receivables and any billings of customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as a component of Accounts payable. As of December 31, 2015, there were $149.5 million of revenues in excess of billings and $146.3 million of billings in excess of revenues on long-term contracts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe have funding requirements associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2015, which are estimated to be $34.9 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. Other long-term liabilities, such as those for asbestos and other legal claims, employee benefit plan obligations, deferred income taxes and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount.\nGoodwill represents the costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired associated with our acquisitions.\nDuring 2015, based on the results of the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, we concluded based on a preponderance of positive indicators and the weight of such indicators that the fair values of our Fluid Handling, Howden Compressors and Howden Heavy Fans & Heaters reporting units are more likely than not greater than their respective carrying amounts and as a result, quantitative analyses would not be needed. Therefore, no further testing of goodwill for impairment was performed for these reporting units.\nAccounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes\u201d prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a position taken in a tax return. Under this standard, we must presume the income tax position will be examined by a relevant tax authority and determine whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. An income tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. Liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are reviewed periodically and are adjusted as events occur that affect our estimates, such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits and, if applicable, the conclusion of any court proceedings. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, were $52.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and are included in Other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe entered into a credit agreement by and among the Company, Colfax UK Holdings Ltd, the other subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, the lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent (the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement\u201d) on September 12, 2011. In connection with the Charter Acquisition, the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement was amended on January 13, 2012 and we terminated our existing credit agreement as well as Charter's outstanding indebtedness.\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOn December 22, 2014, we entered into a receivables financing facility, pursuant to which we established a wholly owned, special purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary which purchases trade receivables from certain of our subsidiaries on an ongoing basis and pledges them to support its obligation as borrower under the receivables financing facility. This special purpose subsidiary has a separate legal existence from its parent and its assets are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of the selling subsidiaries or any other member of the consolidated group. Availability of funds may fluctuate over time given changes in eligible receivable balances, but will not exceed the program limit. On December 21, 2015, the Company increased the receivables financing facility by $15 million to $95 million and extended the facility through December 20, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the total outstanding borrowings under the receivables financing facility were $75.8 million and the interest rate was 1.2%. The scheduled termination date for the receivables financing facility may be extended from time to time. The facility contains representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities customary for facilities of this type. The facility does not contain any covenants that we view as materially constraining to the activities of our business.\nWe design, manufacture, install and maintain gas- and fluid-handling products for use in a wide range of markets, including power generation, oil, gas and petrochemical, mining, marine (including defense) and general industrial and other. Our gas-handling products are principally marketed under the Howden brand name. Howden's primary products are heavy-duty fans, rotary heat exchangers and compressors. The fans and heat exchangers are used in coal-fired and other types of power stations, both in combustion and emissions control applications, underground mines, steel sintering plants and other industrial facilities that require movement of large volumes of air in harsh applications. Howden's compressors are mainly used in the oil, gas and petrochemical end market. Our fluid-handling products are marketed by Colfax Fluid Handling under a portfolio of brands including Allweiler and Imo. Colfax Fluid Handling is a supplier of a broad range of fluid-handling products, including pumps, fluid-handling systems and controls, and specialty valves.\nGas and Fluid Handling\n\nOur financial performance and growth are driven by many factors, principally our ability to serve global markets, fluctuations in the relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, general economic conditions, the global economy and capital spending levels, the availability of capital, our estimates concerning the availability of insurance proceeds to cover asbestos litigation expense and liabilities, the amount of asbestos liabilities and litigation expense, the impact of restructuring initiatives, our ability to pass cost increases on through pricing, the impact of sales mix, and our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions. These key factors have impacted our results of operations in the past and are likely to affect them in the future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs our gas- and fluid-handling customers seek to fully utilize capital spending budgets before the end of the year, historically our shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter. Also, all of our European operations typically experience a slowdown during the July and August and December holiday season. General economic conditions may, however, impact future seasonal variations.\nItems Affecting Comparability of Reported Results\nIn the evaluation of Goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting entity is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the reporting entity's fair value is performed and compared to the carrying value of that entity. In certain instances, we may skip the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the first step of the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and step two of the impairment analysis is performed. In step two of the analysis, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's Goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise.\nCash flows from financing activities during 2015 were impacted by the refinancing of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement further discussed under \"-Borrowing Arrangements\" above. Additionally, cash flows from financing activities during 2015 were impacted by the share repurchases discussed under -Equity Capital\u201d.\nIncome before income taxes was $236.9 million and the Provision for income taxes was $49.7 million for 2015. The Provision for income taxes was impacted by a tax benefit of $13.0 million associated with the resolution of a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and the effect of foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. tax rate.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance, we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made.\nCertain amounts not allocated to the two reportable segments and intersegment eliminations are reported under the heading Corporate and other.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nStrategic Acquisitions\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $197.4 million of Cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $108.0 million from $305.4 million as of December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes the change in Cash and cash equivalents during the periods indicated:\nCash flows from financing activities during 2014 were impacted by the funding of the Victor Acquisition. The Victor Acquisition was funded through net proceeds of $610.4 million from the sale of newly issued Common stock and $338.4 million of borrowings under our Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. Cash flows from financing activities during 2014 were also impacted by the conversion of the Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock further discussed above under -Equity Capital.\u201d Cash flows from financing activities for 2013 were impacted by the amendments to the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement further discussed above under -Borrowing Arrangements\u201d and the May 2013 sale of newly issued Common stock further discussed above under -Equity Capital.\u201d The sale of our Common stock in May 2013 generated $319.9 million cash inflows from financing activities.\nFor our Fabrication Technology reporting unit, we noted unfavorable domestic and international economic trends, particularly trading volumes, which are driven by overall macroeconomic conditions within the welding industry. As such, we did not perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill for our Fabrication Technology reporting unit and proceeded directly to performing the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for 2015. Our quantitative impairment assessment of Goodwill associated with the Fabrication Technology reporting unit, based on the methodologies identified above, resulted in a calculated fair value that exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. Although we believe our calculated fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit by a reasonably sufficient amount, future deterioration in our performance or continued decline in demand from the fabrication technology end markets that we serve could result in a lower projected fair value in future periods.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nIn conjunction with the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, we recorded a charge to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $4.7 million to write-off certain deferred financing fees and original issue discount and expensed approximately $0.4 million of costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. The Company had an original issue discount of $7.5 million and deferred financing fees of $8.1 million included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, which will be accreted to Interest expense primarily using the effective interest method, over the life of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted-average interest rate of borrowings under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement was 1.83%, excluding accretion of original issue discount and amortization of deferred financing fees, and there was $688.8 million available on the revolving credit facility.\nWe recognize revenue and costs from product sales when title passes to the buyer and all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, there are no further obligations to customers, and collectibility is probable. Product delivery occurs when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer. Our shipping terms vary based on the contract. If any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Any customer allowances and discounts are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the sales price for the products sold. These allowances and discounts are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to service agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement.\nOn July 9, 2013, Colfax completed the acquisition of the common stock of Clarus for $13.2 million, which included the fair value of an estimated additional contingent cash payment of $2.5 million at the acquisition date. The additional contingent payment would be paid during the year ending December 31, 2016 subject to the achievement of certain performance goals. However, we do not expect the performance goals to be achieved. Clarus is a domestic supplier of flushing services for marine applications primarily to U.S. government agencies, with primary operations based in Bellingham, Washington.\nOn April 14, 2014, Colfax completed the Victor Acquisition for net cash consideration of $948.8 million, subject to certain adjustments. Victor is a pre-eminent global manufacturer of cutting, gas control and specialty welding solutions. The acquisition complemented the geographic footprint of our fabrication technology segment and expanded our product portfolio into new applications.\nOn December 25, 2015, the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a subsidiary was redeemed and settled by offset of the outstanding loan payable to the Company by the holders of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.\nCertain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company have agreed to guarantee the obligations of the Company under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. The 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt or liens, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, make investments or pay dividends. In addition, the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio, as defined therein, of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 and minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined therein, of 3.0 to 1.0, measured at the end of each quarter. The 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement contains various events of default (including failure to comply with the covenants under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement and related agreements) and upon an event of default the lenders may, subject to various customary cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan and the Revolver. The Company is in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2015. We believe that our sources of liquidity, including the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, are adequate to fund our operations for the next twelve months.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIn the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying value, a calculation is performed and compared to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We measure the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief from royalty\u201d method. Significant estimates in this approach include projected revenues and royalty and discount rates for each trade name evaluated.\n \u2022 Changes in net working capital also affected the operating cash flows for the periods presented. We define working capital as Trade receivables, net and Inventories, net reduced by Accounts payable. During 2015, net working capital decreased by $52.5 million due to improved collections in receivables, partially offset by a slight increase in inventory and decreases in payables. During 2014, net working capital increased by $16.7 million primarily due to seasonal increases in receivables and decreases in payables, partially offset by a decrease in inventory as we reduced the high inventory levels attributable to the Victor Acquisition, which reduced our cash flows from operating activities. During 2013, net working capital decreased by $110 million, primarily due to a decrease in inventory from our CBS initiatives and an increase in payables associated with the timing of year-end purchases partially offset by the seasonal increase in receivables, which increased our cash flows from operating activities.  Cash flows from investing activities during 2015 were impacted by the net cash outflows of $180.7 million associated with the Roots Acquisition and $15.3 million for the Simsmart acquisition. Cash flows from investing activities during 2014 were impacted by the net cash outflows of $948.8 million associated with the Victor Acquisition. During 2013, the acquisitions of GII, Clarus, \u010cKDK, TLT-Babcock, Alphair and Sicelub resulted in net cash outflows of $399.9 million.\nThe decrease in Interest expense during 2014 was primarily attributable to the amendments to the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement (as defined and further discussed in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Borrowing Arrangements\") during 2013. During 2013, $29.4 million of certain deferred fees and original issue discount were written-off in connection with the amendments which reduced future accretion to Interest expense and did not reoccur in 2014. Additionally, the favorable impact of lower borrowing rates reduced Interest expense by $13.7 million and the lesser accretion of deferred fees and original issue discount decreased Interest expense by $6.2 million, which were also attributable to the amendments in 2013. A reduction of $3.1 million is included in Interest expense due to the change in expected settlement under the conditions specified in the contract of the mandatorily redeemable non-voting preferred stock of Sicelub, as the performance criteria were not met.\nWe are also party to additional letter of credit facilities with total capacity of $718.8 million. Total letters of credit of $360.4 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nThe $191.7 million Net sales increase during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of acquisition-related growth of $347.3 million, partially offset by changes in foreign exchange rates which had a negative impact of $107.9 million. The $47.7 million Net sales decline due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2014 in comparison to 2013 was primarily the result of decreases in consumable volumes in most geographies. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2014 increased reflecting the positive impact of cost control activities. Additionally, Gross profit and gross profit margin during 2014 were positively impacted by the higher gross margins at Victor, which were partially offset by acquisition-related inventory step up expense of $9.0 million. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expense during 2014 was primarily due to an acquisition-related increase of $95.5 million and the foreign currency loss at our Venezuelan fabrication technology business discussed previously.\nWe have contracts in various stages of completion. Such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition. Significant management judgments and estimates, including estimated costs to complete projects, must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized during each period. Current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available. The revisions are recorded in income in the period in which they are determined using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.\nOperating Expenses - Total Company\nEquity Capital\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies\nBusiness Segments\nRevenue Recognition\n \u2022 Net cash received or paid for asbestos-related costs, net of insurance proceeds, including the disposition of claims, defense costs and legal expenses related to litigation against our insurers, creates variability in our operating cash flows. We had net cash outflows of $22.7 million, $32.7 million and $39.6 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n\nPricing\nIncome before income taxes was $358.2 million and the Benefit from income taxes was $62.0 million for 2014. The Benefit from income taxes was impacted by the reassessment of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets as a result of the effect of the Victor Acquisition on expected future U.S. income. This reassessment resulted in a decrease in the Company's valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. The reduction in the valuation allowance created a non-cash income tax benefit for 2014 of $145.4 million. Additionally, a tax benefit of $21.8 million was included in Benefit from income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income during 2014 associated with the resolution of a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. These items, as well as the impact of foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. tax rate, are the principal reasons for a tax benefit rather than a tax provision, which would result from the application of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the reported Income before income taxes for 2014.\nWe entered into a Second and Third amendment to the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement on February 22, 2013 and November 7, 2013, respectively, which, among other things, reallocated our borrowing capacities of the tranches of loans and reduced our interest rate margins when compared to the terms of the amended Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement on January 13, 2012. In conjunction with the 2013 amendments, we recorded a charge to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $29.4 million to write-off certain deferred financing fees and original issue discount and expensed approximately $1.2 million of costs incurred in connection with the refinancing.\nGross Profit - Total Company\n (2) Excludes open purchase orders for goods or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which is not certain. \nWe have projected each subsidiary's future asbestos-related liability costs with regard to pending and future unasserted claims based upon the Nicholson methodology. The Nicholson methodology is a standard approach used by experts and has been accepted by numerous courts. This methodology is based upon risk equations, exposed population estimates, mortality rates, and other demographic statistics. In applying the Nicholson methodology for each subsidiary we performed: (1) an analysis of the estimated population likely to have been exposed or claim to have been exposed to products manufactured by the subsidiaries based upon national studies undertaken of the population of workers believed to have been exposed to asbestos; (2) a review of epidemiological and demographic studies to estimate the number of potentially exposed people that would be likely to develop asbestos-related diseases in each year; (3) an analysis of the subsidiaries' recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates for these diseases and (4) an analysis of the historical asbestos liability costs to develop average values, which vary by disease type, jurisdiction and the nature of claim, to determine an estimate of costs likely to be associated with currently pending and projected asbestos claims. Our projections, based upon the Nicholson methodology, estimate both claims and the estimated cash outflows related to the resolution of such claims for periods up to and including the endpoint of asbestos studies referred to in item (2) above. It is our policy to record a liability for asbestos-related liability costs for the longest period of time that we can reasonably estimate. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years.\n\u2022Overview\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $146.9 million during 2014 in comparison to 2013 primarily due to an increase of $161.8 million attributable to the addition of the operations associated with the Victor Acquisition and the gas- and fluid-handling acquisitions during 2013. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes the specific charges discussed above associated with impairment, loss on disposition of a business line and foreign currency, partially offset by significant cost saving programs in both segments and an unrealized gain of $2.9 million related to the Clarus contingent payment liability, as the performance criteria are no longer expected to be met. Restructuring and other related charges increased compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in restructuring actions to reduce structural costs and integrate the acquisitions made during 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013.\nOn November 29, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of GII for $246.0 million, including the assumption of debt, subject to certain adjustments. GII has operations around the world and expanded the Company's product offerings in the heavy duty industrial and cooling fan market.\nOverview\nOn May 13, 2013, we sold 7,500,000 shares of newly issued Colfax Common stock to underwriters for public resale pursuant to a shelf registration statement for an aggregate purchase price of $331.9 million. In conjunction with this issuance, we recognized $12.0 million in equity issuance costs which were recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital during 2013.\n\nWe complement our organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions can significantly affect our reported results and can complicate period to period comparisons of results. As a consequence, we report the change in our Net sales between periods both from existing and acquired businesses. Orders and order backlog are presented only for the gas- and fluid-handling segment, where this information is relevant. The change in Net sales due to acquisitions represents the change in sales due to the following acquisitions:\nBorrowing Arrangements\n(4) Represents the difference between prior year sales, orders and order backlog valued at the actual prior year foreign exchange rates and prior year sales, orders and order backlog valued at current year foreign exchange rates.\nDuring 2014, an analysis was performed on a trade name related to a specific operation within the gas- and fluid-handling segment prior to the annual impairment analysis due to the decision to substantially reduce its operations. The analysis determined the trade name was no longer recoverable based upon relief from royalty measurements and resulted in a $2.9 million impairment loss included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2014.\nCertain subsidiaries are each one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos. Such components were acquired from third-party suppliers, and were not manufactured by any of the Company's subsidiaries nor were the subsidiaries producers or direct suppliers of asbestos. The manufactured products that are alleged to have contained asbestos generally were provided to meet the specifications of the subsidiaries' customers, including the U.S. Navy.\nOn June 30, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Roots for $180.7 million. Roots is a leading supplier of blower and compressor technologies which service a broad range of end markets, including wastewater treatment, chemical production, and power generation. The acquisition builds on Howden's global strength in compressors and blowers and adds important application expertise and product solutions to the portfolio.\nOn June 5, 2015, we entered into the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the loans under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement were used by us to repay in full balances under our preexisting Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. The 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement consists of a term loan in an aggregate amount of $750.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d) and a revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d), each of which matures in five years. The Revolver contains a $50.0 million swing line loan sub-facility.\nOn November 1, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of \u010cKDK for $69.4 million, including the assumption of debt. \u010cKDK is a leading supplier of multi-stage centrifugal compressors to the oil & gas, petrochemical, power and steel industries, based in Prague, Czech Republic.\nWe expect to continue to grow as a result of strategic acquisitions. We believe that the extensive experience of our leadership team in acquiring and effectively integrating acquisition targets should enable us to capitalize on opportunities in the future.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nOn September 30, 2013, the Company completed the acquisitions of TLT-Babcock and Alphair for an aggregate purchase price of $55.7 million. TLT-Babcock and Alphair are suppliers of heavy duty and industrial fans in Akron, Ohio and Winnipeg, Manitoba, respectively.\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our financial statements, see Note 3, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nA significant portion of our Net sales, approximately 72% for the year ended December 31, 2015, is derived from operations outside the U.S., with the majority of those sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because much of our manufacturing and employee costs are outside the U.S., a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nThe $170.3 million Net sales decrease due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2015 in comparison to 2014 was primarily due to declines in the power generation, mining, and general industrial and other end markets, partially offset by growth in the marine and oil, gas, and petrochemical end markets. Additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $225.4 million, partially offset by acquisition related growth of $47.9 million. Gross profit decreased during 2015, which was primarily the result of changes in foreign exchange rates and lower volumes. Gross profit margin increased during 2015 in comparison to 2014 as improved margins through cost control and restructuring savings were more than sufficient to offset the impact of lower volumes. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2015 primarily due to accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess in the cost structure of the Company in response to the current challenging, cyclical economic conditions. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2015 decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates, cost control activities and the impact of lower volumes, partially offset by acquisition-related growth, $8.1 million of charges associated with uncollectible accounts of a specific customer in South America, $2.8 million of asset impairment charges which includes a $1.7 million impairment loss related to a finite-lived intangible asset, approximately $8.0 million of transaction costs and year-one amortization charges associated with 2015 acquisitions, and a $4.1 million charge for revaluation of net asbestos-related liabilities. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes a $13.4 million impairment loss related to identifiable intangible assets, a $4.0 million loss on disposition of a small fluid-handling business line and a $1.3 million foreign currency loss from the use of the SICAD II exchange rate at our Venezuelan fluid-handling business, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $2.9 million related to the Clarus contingent payment liability.\n(3) Represents the incremental sales, orders and order backlog as a result of our acquisitions.\nand solvency of the various insurers, and employed such insurance allocation methodologies as we believed appropriate to ascertain the probable insurance recoveries for asbestos liabilities. The analysis took into account self-insurance retentions, policy exclusions, pending litigation, liability caps and gaps in coverage, existing and potential insolvencies of insurers as well as how legal and defense costs will be covered under the insurance policies.\nWe assessed the subsidiaries' existing insurance arrangements and agreements, estimated the applicability of insurance coverage for existing and expected future claims, analyzed publicly available information bearing on the current creditworthiness\nColfax has a global geographic footprint, with production facilities in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Australia and Africa. Through our reportable segments, we serve a global customer base across multiple markets through a combination of direct sales and third-party distribution channels. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial, industrial and government customers.\nOur products and services are available worldwide. The manner in which our products and services are sold differs by region. During 2015, approximately 74% of our sales were shipped to locations outside of the U.S. Accordingly, we are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic and political factors in countries throughout the world. Our ability to grow and our financial performance will be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations, including efficiently utilizing our global sales, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, the expansion of market opportunities in Asia, successfully completing global strategic acquisitions and engineering innovative new product applications for end users in a variety of geographic markets. However, we believe that our geographic, end market and product diversification may limit the impact that any one country or economy could have on our consolidated results.\nThe $172.6 million increase in Gross profit during 2014 in comparison to 2013 was attributable to increases of $70.0 million and $102.6 million in our gas- and fluid-handling segment and our fabrication technology segment, respectively. The increase in gross profit margin in both of our segments during 2014 reflects the positive impact of cost control activities. Additionally, our fabrication technology segment was positively impacted during 2014 by the higher gross margins of Victor, which were partially offset by acquisition-related inventory step up expense. The increase in Gross profit in our gas- and fluid-handling segment during 2014 includes the impact of acquisitions, which also served to reduce gross profit margin. Changes in foreign exchange rates during 2014 had a $44.0 million negative impact on Gross profit.\nManagement's analyses are based on currently known facts and a number of assumptions. However, projecting future events, such as new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of resolving each claim, coverage issues among layers of insurers, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, the continuing solvency of various insurance companies, the amount of remaining insurance available, as well as the numerous uncertainties inherent in asbestos litigation could cause the actual liabilities and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than those projected or recorded which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nFabrication Technology\nOverview\nThe $227.0 million decrease in Gross profit during 2015 in comparison to 2014 was attributable to decreases of $102.3 million and $124.7 million in our gas- and fluid-handling segment and our fabrication technology segment, respectively. The decrease in gross profit in both of our segments during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates and lower overall volumes, partially offset by acquisition related growth. The increase in gross profit margin in our gas- and fluid-handling segment during 2015 as compared to 2014 was more than offset by the lower gross profit margin at fabrication technology. Changes in foreign exchange rates during 2015 had a $169.0 million negative impact on Gross profit.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $105.2 million during 2015 in comparison to 2014. Changes in foreign exchange rates during 2015 decreased Selling, general, and administrative expenses by primarily $111.3 million. An overall decrease in acquisition integration costs and the positive benefit of restructuring actions to reduce structural costs and integrate acquisitions also contributed to the decrease. These items were partially offset by a $40.4 million acquisition-related increase in Selling, general and administrative expense during 2015. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2015 includes an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of specific South American customers of $9.4 million, asset impairment charges of $4.3 million, and transaction costs and year-one amortization of approximately $8.0 million, as discussed previously. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of Net sales increased primarily as a result of lower Net sales driven by reasons discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes a $13.4 million impairment loss related to identifiable intangible assets, a $4.0 million loss on disposition of a small fluid-handling business line and a $6.3 million loss from the use of the SICAD II exchange rate at our Venezuelan businesses. The increase in Restructuring and other related charges during 2015 is attributable to our gas- and fluid-handling segment due to accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess in the cost structure of the Company in response to the current challenging, cyclical economic conditions.\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire pool of customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $39.5 million and $27.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The current year increase was primarily driven by an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of specific South American customers of $9.4 million. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required.\nThe decrease in Net sales from existing businesses during 2015 compared to 2014 was attributable to decreases of $170.3 million and $134.2 million in our gas- and fluid-handling and fabrication technology segments, respectively. Orders, net of cancellations, from existing businesses for our gas- and fluid-handling segment decreased during 2015 in comparison to 2014 due to declining demand in all end markets from unfavorable domestic and international macroeconomic conditions.\nContinuation of the decline in oil prices increases the risk of impairments next year. Actual results could differ from our estimates and projections, which would also affect the assessment of impairment. As of December 31, 2015, we have Goodwill of $2.8 billion and indefinite lived trade names of $395.3 million that are subject to at least annual review for impairment. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nHistorically, we have financed our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuances of equity. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital, funding of acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, asbestos-related cash outflows and funding of our pension plans. If additional funds are needed for strategic acquisitions or other corporate purposes, we believe we could raise additional funds in the form of debt or equity.\n\nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for our gas- and fluid-handling segment:\nEconomic Conditions\nThe following discussion of Results of Operations addresses the comparison of the periods presented. The Company's management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon Net sales and segment operating income (loss), which represents Operating income (loss) before Restructuring and other related charges.\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe measure fair value of reporting units based on a present value of future discounted cash flows and a market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that the reporting units are expected to generate in the future. Significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: the weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the Company against certain market information. Significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying appropriate market multiples and assessing earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.\nDemand for our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance by our customers. The level of capital expenditures depends, in turn, on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. While demand can be cyclical, we believe that our diversified operations generally limit the impact of a downturn in any one market on our consolidated results. However, we are currently in the midst of a sustained decline in commodity prices, including oil, which has had a negative impact on the levels of capital invested and maintenance expenditures by certain of our customers which in turn has reduced the demand for our products and services.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe believe our customers place a premium on quality, reliability, availability, design and application engineering support. Our highly engineered gas- and fluid-handling products typically have higher margins than products with commodity-like qualities. However, we are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for components and raw materials including steel, iron, copper and aluminum. Historically, we have been generally successful in passing raw material price increases on to our customers. While we seek to take actions to manage this risk, including commodity hedging where appropriate, such increased costs may adversely impact earnings.\nSales and Cost Mix\nThe following MD&A should be read together with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The MD&A includes forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in these forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe $31.3 million Net sales decrease due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2014 in comparison to 2013 was primarily due to declines in the oil, gas and petrochemical, power generation and marine end markets, partially offset by growth in the mining and general industrial and other end markets. Additionally, Net sales increased by $287.9 million due to acquisitions and changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $31.0 million. Gross profit increased during 2014 reflecting the impact of acquisitions. Gross profit margin increased during 2014 in comparison to 2013 as improved margins through cost control and restructuring savings in our gas-handling business were more than sufficient to offset the lower margins of the acquired entities. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2014 primarily due to an increase in restructuring actions to reduce structural costs and integrate the acquisitions made during the fourth quarter of 2013. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a $66.3 million increase due to acquisitions and the specific 2014 charges discussed previously.\nWe expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to continue to negatively impact our overall results of operations in 2016 as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.\nEach subsidiary has separate insurance coverage acquired prior to our ownership of each independent entity. In our evaluation of the insurance asset, we use differing insurance allocation methodologies for each subsidiary based upon the applicable law pertaining to the affected subsidiary.\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in working capital and the timing of payments for items such as pension funding and asbestos-related costs. Changes in significant operating cash flow items are discussed below.\nOutlook\n\u2022Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\nSeasonality\nThe Term Loan and the Revolver bear interest, at the election of the Company, at either the base rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement) or the Eurocurrency rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement), in each case, plus the applicable interest rate margin. The Term Loan and the Revolver initially bear interest either at the Eurocurrency rate plus 1.50% or at the base rate plus 0.50% , and in future quarters will bear interest either at the Eurocurrency rate or the base rate plus the applicable interest rate margin based upon either, whichever results in the lower applicable interest rate margin (subject to certain exceptions), the Company's total leverage ratio and the corporate family rating of the Company as determined by Standard & Poor's and Moody's (ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% , in the case of the Eurocurrency margin, and 0.25% to 1.00% , in the case\n", "item_7_text": "The following table summarizes selected financial data for our fabrication technology segment:\nWe contributed 66,000 shares, 183,000 shares, and 88,200 shares of newly issued Colfax Common stock to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan on May 21, 2015, January 15, 2014 and September 12, 2013, respectively.\nThe decrease in Net sales from existing businesses during 2014 compared to 2013 was attributable to decreases of $47.7 million and $31.3 million in our fabrication technology and gas- and fluid-handling segments, respectively. Orders, net of cancellations, from existing businesses for our gas- and fluid-handling segment were flat during 2014 in comparison to 2013 as declines in demand from the oil, gas and petrochemical, power generation and mining end markets were offset by growth in demand from the marine and general industrial and other end markets.\nFabrication Technology\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe evaluate the recoverability of Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit or asset exceeds its implied fair value.\n \u2022 Funding requirements of our defined benefit plans, including pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, can vary significantly from period to period due to changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions. For 2015, 2014 and 2013 cash contributions for defined benefit plans were $44.1 million, $59.6 million and $46.9 million, respectively. \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nOn October 5, 2015, Colfax completed the acquisition of Simsmart for cash consideration of $15.3 million, net of cash acquired. Simsmart provides a software product that controls ventilation conditions and increases fan efficiency. The acquisition of Simsmart expands the Howden product portfolio primarily within the mining end market and other end markets with challenging ventilation conditions.\nProvision for Income Taxes - Total Company\nPlease see Part I, Item 1. Business\u201d for a discussion of Colfax's objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. We report our operations through the following reportable segments:\nGas and Fluid Handling\n\nThe lift of currency controls in Argentina in December 2015 has caused the Argentine peso to devalue relative to the U.S. dollar. We may be subject to additional foreign currency losses depending on whether Argentina further devalues the peso. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, our Argentine operations represented less than 1% of our Total assets and approximately 2% of our Net sales.\nCash Flows\nAs discussed further above, the Company reports results in two reportable segments: gas and fluid handling and fabrication technology. The following table summarizes Net sales by reportable segment for each of the following periods:\nOur Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 included $186.9 million held in jurisdictions outside the U.S., which may be subject to tax penalties if repatriated into the U.S. and other restrictions.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company's management. This MD&A is divided into four main sections:\nInterest Expense - Total Company\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have in the past divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, certain representations, warranties and indemnities were made to purchasers to cover various risks or unknown liabilities. We cannot estimate the potential liability, if any, that may result from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown and unexpected contingencies; however, we do not believe that any such liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n(1) Represents contracts for products or services, net of cancellations for the period, for our gas- and fluid-handling segment.\nSee Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our asbestos liabilities and insurance assets.\n\nWe employ a comprehensive set of tools that we refer to as CBS. CBS is our business management system. It is a repeatable, teachable process that we use to create superior value for our customers, shareholders and associates. Rooted in our core values, it is our culture. CBS provides the tools and techniques to ensure that we are continuously improving our ability to meet or exceed customer requirements on a consistent basis.\n(2) Excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, thus providing a measure of growth due to factors such as price, product mix and volume.\nOur Net sales increased from $4.2 billion in 2013 to $4.6 billion in 2014. In 2015, our Net sales decreased to $4.0 billion. The following table presents the components of changes in consolidated Net sales and, for our gas- and fluid-handling segment, orders and order backlog:\n \u2022 Fabrication Technology - a global supplier of welding equipment and consumables, cutting equipment and consumables and automated welding and cutting systems. \nWe entered into a Conversion Agreement with the BDT Investor, pursuant to which the BDT Investor exercised its option to convert 13,877,552 shares of Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock into 12,173,291 shares of the Company's Common stock plus cash in lieu of a .22807018 share interest, which conversion occurred on February 12, 2014. As consideration for the BDT Investor's agreement to exercise its optional conversion right, the Company paid approximately $23.4 million to the BDT\nOur profit margins vary in relation to the relative mix of many factors, including the type of product, the geographic location in which the product is manufactured, the end market for which the product is designed, and the percentage of total revenue represented by consumables and aftermarket sales and services. Consumables are generally sold at lower margins in comparison to our foremarket products and equipment, whereas our aftermarket business, including spare parts and other value added services, is generally a higher margin business.\nFrom time-to-time, we have identified certain indefinite-lived intangible assets that, due to indicators present at the specific operation associated with the indefinite-lived intangible asset, should be tested for impairment prior to our annual impairment evaluation. During 2015, an analysis was performed to evaluate certain intangible assets related to a specific operation within the Company due to a decline in anticipated performance at the operation associated with those assets. The analysis determined an indefinite-lived trade name within the Company's fabrication technology segment was impaired based upon relief from royalty measurements and resulted in a $1.5 million impairment loss calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value as of the date of the impairment test. The impairment loss was included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2015.\nThe Net sales decrease during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in existing businesses of $134.2 million and changes in foreign exchange rates which had a negative impact of $298.7 million, partially offset by acquisition-related growth of $123.3 million. The $134.2 million Net sales decline due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2015 in comparison to 2014 was primarily the result of decreases in equipment sales and consumable volumes in most regions. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2015 decreased reflecting changes in foreign exchange rates, lower volumes, mix impact from oil and gas and lower overall capital equipment spending. The decrease in Selling, general and administrative expense during 2015 was primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates, cost control activities and the impact of lower volumes, partially offset by an acquisition-related increase of $24.1 million, and a $1.5 million impairment loss related to an identifiable intangible asset during 2015. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes a $5.0 million loss from the use of the SICAD II exchange rate at our Venezuelan fabrication technology business, which did not repeat in 2015.\nRetirement Benefits\nThe annual Goodwill impairment analysis performed as of September 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 indicated no impairment to be present.\n\nAsbestos Liabilities and Insurance Assets\nOn May 14, 2014, we entered into an Incremental Amendment to the Term A-1 facility under the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, to increase the borrowing capacity of the Term A-1 facility by $150.0 million, upon the same terms as the existing Term A-1 facility.\n \u2022 Gas and Fluid Handling - a global supplier of a broad range of gas- and fluid-handling products, including heavy-duty centrifugal and axial fans, rotary heat exchangers, gas compressors, pumps, fluid-handling systems and controls and specialty valves, which serves customers in the power generation, oil, gas and petrochemical, mining, marine (including defense) and general industrial and other end markets; and \nGlobal Operations\nOn October 11, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the Company's Common stock from time-to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program is authorized until December 31, 2016. The timing and amount of shares repurchased is to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. During the fourth quarter of 2015 the Company repurchased 986,279 shares of the Company's Common stock in open market transactions through the close of business on December 31, 2015. From January 1, 2016 through February 3, 2016, the Company has repurchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company's Common stock under a 10b5-1 Plan. As of February 4, 2016, the remaining stock repurchase authorization provided by the Company's Board of Directors is approximately $52 million.\nThe annual impairment analysis performed as of September 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 indicated no impairment to be present, except for $0.2 million of impairment loss related to an indefinite-lived intangible asset included in the gas- and fluid-handling segment for the year ended December 31, 2013. This impairment results from a decline in anticipated revenue related to this asset. The impairment loss is included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income and was calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset under the relief from royalty method and its carrying value as of the date of the impairment test. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nOn November 25, 2013, the Company increased its ownership of Sicelub, previously a less than wholly owned subsidiary in which the Company did not have a controlling interest, from 44% to 100%. Sicelub provides flushing services to Central and South American customers primarily in the oil, gas and petrochemical end market.\nProjecting future asbestos-related liability costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict, including, among others, the number of claims that might be received, the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the latency period associated with asbestos exposure, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the financial resources of other companies that are co-defendants in the claims, funds available in post-bankruptcy trusts, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, including fluctuations in the timing of court actions and rulings, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards, including potential tort reform. Furthermore, any projections with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. These trend factors have both positive and negative effects on the dynamics of asbestos litigation in the tort system and the related best estimate of our asbestos liability, and these effects do not move in linear fashion but rather change over multiple year periods. Accordingly, we monitor these trend factors over time and periodically assess whether an alternative forecast period is appropriate. Taking these factors into account and the inherent uncertainties, we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims that will be resolved in the next 15 years and have recorded that liability as our best estimate. While it is reasonably possible that the subsidiaries will incur costs after this period, we do not believe the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss is estimable at the current time. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years. Defense costs associated with asbestos-related liabilities as well as costs incurred related to litigation against the subsidiaries' insurers are expensed as incurred.\nCash flows from financing activities were also impacted by acquisitions of shares of less than wholly owned subsidiaries. During 2014, cash flows from financing activities included the $10.3 million acquisition of the remaining ownership of Svel and Howden Middle East. During 2013, cash flows from financing activities included a $14.9 million acquisition of common and investment shares of Soldex resulting in an increase in our ownership of the subsidiary from approximately 91% to 99%.\nOn September 25, 2015, we entered into an Increase Agreement, as provided for under the terms of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. Under the Increase Agreement, we increased the Revolver by $300.0 million, resulting in a total Revolver commitment under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement of $1.3 billion. The Term Loan and the Revolver bear interest, at the election of the Company, at either the base rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement) or the Eurocurrency rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement), in each case, plus the applicable interest rate margin.\nof the base rate margin). Swing line loans bear interest at the applicable rate, as specified under the terms of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, based upon the currency borrowed.\nWe believe that we are well positioned to grow our businesses organically over the long term by enhancing our product offerings and expanding our customer base. Our business mix is expected to be well balanced between long- and short-cycle businesses, sales in emerging markets and developed nations and fore- and aftermarket products and services. Given this balance, management does not use indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. Instead, the individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and outlook for the future.\n (1) Variable interest payments are estimated using a static rate of 1.83%. \nThe decrease in Interest expense during 2015 was primarily due to decreases in weighted average interest rates, outstanding borrowing levels and amortization of deferred financing fees and original issue discount. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.7 million write-off of certain deferred financings fees during 2015 in connection with the refinancing of our principal credit facility.\nInvestor, of which $19.6 million represents the Preferred stock conversion inducement payment in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2014.\nSales, Orders and Backlog\nIn February 2015, the Venezuelan government introduced a marginal foreign exchange system ( SIMADI\u201d) which replaces an auction-based foreign exchange system that began operating on March 24, 2015 ( SICAD II\u201d), which we previously used to remeasure our Venezuelan operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we have determined the SIMADI to be the most appropriate rate with which to remeasure or Venezuelan operations from the multiple current legal mechanisms in Venezuela to exchange currency. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, our Venezuelan operation represented less than 1% of our Total assets and Net sales. The foreign currency transaction loss recognized related to the adoption of the SIMADI did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe formulate, develop, manufacture and supply consumable products and equipment for use in the cutting and joining of steels, aluminum and other metals and metal alloys. Our fabrication technology products are marketed under several brand names, most notably ESAB and Victor, which we believe are well known in the international cutting and welding industry. ESAB's comprehensive range of cutting and welding consumables includes electrodes, cored and solid wire and fluxes. ESAB's fabrication technology equipment ranges from portable welding machines to large customized cutting and automated welding systems. The Victor Acquisition complemented the geographic footprint of our fabrication technology segment and expanded our cutting equipment and consumables, gas control and specialty welding product lines. Products are sold into a wide range of end markets, including oil & gas, power generation, wind power, shipbuilding, pipelines, mobile/off-highway equipment and mining.\nThe mix of sales was as follows for the periods presented:\n \u2022 During 2015, 2014 and 2013 cash payments of $57.7 million, $43.5 million and $47.3 million, respectively, were made related to our restructuring initiatives. \nContractual Obligations\nOn February 20, 2014, we sold 9,200,000 shares of newly issued Colfax Common stock to underwriters for public resale pursuant to the shelf registration statement for an aggregate purchase price of $632.5 million. In conjunction with this issuance, we recognized $22.1 million in equity issuance costs, which were recorded as a reduction in Additional paid-in capital during 2014.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015 other than outstanding letters of credit of $360.4 million, unconditional purchase obligations with suppliers of $351.4 million, and $141.3 million of future operating lease payments.\nPension obligations and other post-retirement benefits are actuarially determined and are affected by several assumptions, including the discount rate, assumed annual rates of return on plan assets, and per capita cost of covered health care benefits. Changes in discount rate and differences from actual results for each assumption will affect the amounts of pension expense and other post-retirement expense recognized in future periods. These assumptions may also have an effect on the amount and timing of future cash contributions. See Note 13, Defined Benefit Plans\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our evaluation of business and macroeconomic trends and information from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe face a number of challenges and opportunities, including the successful integration of new acquisitions, application and expansion of our CBS tools to improve margins and working capital management, rationalization of assets and back office functions, and consolidation of manufacturing facilities.\nWe recognize revenue and cost of sales on gas-handling long-term contracts using the percentage of completion method\u201d in accordance with GAAP. Under this method, contract revenues are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Any recognized revenues that have not been billed to a customer are recorded as a component of Trade receivables and any billings of customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as a component of Accounts payable. As of December 31, 2015, there were $149.5 million of revenues in excess of billings and $146.3 million of billings in excess of revenues on long-term contracts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe have funding requirements associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2015, which are estimated to be $34.9 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. Other long-term liabilities, such as those for asbestos and other legal claims, employee benefit plan obligations, deferred income taxes and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount.\nGoodwill represents the costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired associated with our acquisitions.\nDuring 2015, based on the results of the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, we concluded based on a preponderance of positive indicators and the weight of such indicators that the fair values of our Fluid Handling, Howden Compressors and Howden Heavy Fans & Heaters reporting units are more likely than not greater than their respective carrying amounts and as a result, quantitative analyses would not be needed. Therefore, no further testing of goodwill for impairment was performed for these reporting units.\nAccounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes\u201d prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a position taken in a tax return. Under this standard, we must presume the income tax position will be examined by a relevant tax authority and determine whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. An income tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. Liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are reviewed periodically and are adjusted as events occur that affect our estimates, such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits and, if applicable, the conclusion of any court proceedings. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, were $52.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and are included in Other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe entered into a credit agreement by and among the Company, Colfax UK Holdings Ltd, the other subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, the lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent (the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement\u201d) on September 12, 2011. In connection with the Charter Acquisition, the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement was amended on January 13, 2012 and we terminated our existing credit agreement as well as Charter's outstanding indebtedness.\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOn December 22, 2014, we entered into a receivables financing facility, pursuant to which we established a wholly owned, special purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary which purchases trade receivables from certain of our subsidiaries on an ongoing basis and pledges them to support its obligation as borrower under the receivables financing facility. This special purpose subsidiary has a separate legal existence from its parent and its assets are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of the selling subsidiaries or any other member of the consolidated group. Availability of funds may fluctuate over time given changes in eligible receivable balances, but will not exceed the program limit. On December 21, 2015, the Company increased the receivables financing facility by $15 million to $95 million and extended the facility through December 20, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the total outstanding borrowings under the receivables financing facility were $75.8 million and the interest rate was 1.2%. The scheduled termination date for the receivables financing facility may be extended from time to time. The facility contains representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities customary for facilities of this type. The facility does not contain any covenants that we view as materially constraining to the activities of our business.\nWe design, manufacture, install and maintain gas- and fluid-handling products for use in a wide range of markets, including power generation, oil, gas and petrochemical, mining, marine (including defense) and general industrial and other. Our gas-handling products are principally marketed under the Howden brand name. Howden's primary products are heavy-duty fans, rotary heat exchangers and compressors. The fans and heat exchangers are used in coal-fired and other types of power stations, both in combustion and emissions control applications, underground mines, steel sintering plants and other industrial facilities that require movement of large volumes of air in harsh applications. Howden's compressors are mainly used in the oil, gas and petrochemical end market. Our fluid-handling products are marketed by Colfax Fluid Handling under a portfolio of brands including Allweiler and Imo. Colfax Fluid Handling is a supplier of a broad range of fluid-handling products, including pumps, fluid-handling systems and controls, and specialty valves.\nGas and Fluid Handling\n\nOur financial performance and growth are driven by many factors, principally our ability to serve global markets, fluctuations in the relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, general economic conditions, the global economy and capital spending levels, the availability of capital, our estimates concerning the availability of insurance proceeds to cover asbestos litigation expense and liabilities, the amount of asbestos liabilities and litigation expense, the impact of restructuring initiatives, our ability to pass cost increases on through pricing, the impact of sales mix, and our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions. These key factors have impacted our results of operations in the past and are likely to affect them in the future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs our gas- and fluid-handling customers seek to fully utilize capital spending budgets before the end of the year, historically our shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter. Also, all of our European operations typically experience a slowdown during the July and August and December holiday season. General economic conditions may, however, impact future seasonal variations.\nItems Affecting Comparability of Reported Results\nIn the evaluation of Goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting entity is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the reporting entity's fair value is performed and compared to the carrying value of that entity. In certain instances, we may skip the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the first step of the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and step two of the impairment analysis is performed. In step two of the analysis, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's Goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise.\nCash flows from financing activities during 2015 were impacted by the refinancing of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement further discussed under \"-Borrowing Arrangements\" above. Additionally, cash flows from financing activities during 2015 were impacted by the share repurchases discussed under -Equity Capital\u201d.\nIncome before income taxes was $236.9 million and the Provision for income taxes was $49.7 million for 2015. The Provision for income taxes was impacted by a tax benefit of $13.0 million associated with the resolution of a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and the effect of foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. tax rate.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance, we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made.\nCertain amounts not allocated to the two reportable segments and intersegment eliminations are reported under the heading Corporate and other.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nStrategic Acquisitions\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $197.4 million of Cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $108.0 million from $305.4 million as of December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes the change in Cash and cash equivalents during the periods indicated:\nCash flows from financing activities during 2014 were impacted by the funding of the Victor Acquisition. The Victor Acquisition was funded through net proceeds of $610.4 million from the sale of newly issued Common stock and $338.4 million of borrowings under our Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. Cash flows from financing activities during 2014 were also impacted by the conversion of the Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock further discussed above under -Equity Capital.\u201d Cash flows from financing activities for 2013 were impacted by the amendments to the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement further discussed above under -Borrowing Arrangements\u201d and the May 2013 sale of newly issued Common stock further discussed above under -Equity Capital.\u201d The sale of our Common stock in May 2013 generated $319.9 million cash inflows from financing activities.\nFor our Fabrication Technology reporting unit, we noted unfavorable domestic and international economic trends, particularly trading volumes, which are driven by overall macroeconomic conditions within the welding industry. As such, we did not perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill for our Fabrication Technology reporting unit and proceeded directly to performing the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for 2015. Our quantitative impairment assessment of Goodwill associated with the Fabrication Technology reporting unit, based on the methodologies identified above, resulted in a calculated fair value that exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. Although we believe our calculated fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit by a reasonably sufficient amount, future deterioration in our performance or continued decline in demand from the fabrication technology end markets that we serve could result in a lower projected fair value in future periods.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nIn conjunction with the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, we recorded a charge to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $4.7 million to write-off certain deferred financing fees and original issue discount and expensed approximately $0.4 million of costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. The Company had an original issue discount of $7.5 million and deferred financing fees of $8.1 million included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, which will be accreted to Interest expense primarily using the effective interest method, over the life of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted-average interest rate of borrowings under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement was 1.83%, excluding accretion of original issue discount and amortization of deferred financing fees, and there was $688.8 million available on the revolving credit facility.\nWe recognize revenue and costs from product sales when title passes to the buyer and all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, there are no further obligations to customers, and collectibility is probable. Product delivery occurs when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer. Our shipping terms vary based on the contract. If any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Any customer allowances and discounts are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the sales price for the products sold. These allowances and discounts are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to service agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement.\nOn July 9, 2013, Colfax completed the acquisition of the common stock of Clarus for $13.2 million, which included the fair value of an estimated additional contingent cash payment of $2.5 million at the acquisition date. The additional contingent payment would be paid during the year ending December 31, 2016 subject to the achievement of certain performance goals. However, we do not expect the performance goals to be achieved. Clarus is a domestic supplier of flushing services for marine applications primarily to U.S. government agencies, with primary operations based in Bellingham, Washington.\nOn April 14, 2014, Colfax completed the Victor Acquisition for net cash consideration of $948.8 million, subject to certain adjustments. Victor is a pre-eminent global manufacturer of cutting, gas control and specialty welding solutions. The acquisition complemented the geographic footprint of our fabrication technology segment and expanded our product portfolio into new applications.\nOn December 25, 2015, the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a subsidiary was redeemed and settled by offset of the outstanding loan payable to the Company by the holders of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.\nCertain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company have agreed to guarantee the obligations of the Company under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. The 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt or liens, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, make investments or pay dividends. In addition, the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio, as defined therein, of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 and minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined therein, of 3.0 to 1.0, measured at the end of each quarter. The 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement contains various events of default (including failure to comply with the covenants under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement and related agreements) and upon an event of default the lenders may, subject to various customary cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan and the Revolver. The Company is in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2015. We believe that our sources of liquidity, including the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, are adequate to fund our operations for the next twelve months.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIn the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying value, a calculation is performed and compared to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We measure the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief from royalty\u201d method. Significant estimates in this approach include projected revenues and royalty and discount rates for each trade name evaluated.\n \u2022 Changes in net working capital also affected the operating cash flows for the periods presented. We define working capital as Trade receivables, net and Inventories, net reduced by Accounts payable. During 2015, net working capital decreased by $52.5 million due to improved collections in receivables, partially offset by a slight increase in inventory and decreases in payables. During 2014, net working capital increased by $16.7 million primarily due to seasonal increases in receivables and decreases in payables, partially offset by a decrease in inventory as we reduced the high inventory levels attributable to the Victor Acquisition, which reduced our cash flows from operating activities. During 2013, net working capital decreased by $110 million, primarily due to a decrease in inventory from our CBS initiatives and an increase in payables associated with the timing of year-end purchases partially offset by the seasonal increase in receivables, which increased our cash flows from operating activities.  Cash flows from investing activities during 2015 were impacted by the net cash outflows of $180.7 million associated with the Roots Acquisition and $15.3 million for the Simsmart acquisition. Cash flows from investing activities during 2014 were impacted by the net cash outflows of $948.8 million associated with the Victor Acquisition. During 2013, the acquisitions of GII, Clarus, \u010cKDK, TLT-Babcock, Alphair and Sicelub resulted in net cash outflows of $399.9 million.\nThe decrease in Interest expense during 2014 was primarily attributable to the amendments to the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement (as defined and further discussed in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Borrowing Arrangements\") during 2013. During 2013, $29.4 million of certain deferred fees and original issue discount were written-off in connection with the amendments which reduced future accretion to Interest expense and did not reoccur in 2014. Additionally, the favorable impact of lower borrowing rates reduced Interest expense by $13.7 million and the lesser accretion of deferred fees and original issue discount decreased Interest expense by $6.2 million, which were also attributable to the amendments in 2013. A reduction of $3.1 million is included in Interest expense due to the change in expected settlement under the conditions specified in the contract of the mandatorily redeemable non-voting preferred stock of Sicelub, as the performance criteria were not met.\nWe are also party to additional letter of credit facilities with total capacity of $718.8 million. Total letters of credit of $360.4 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nThe $191.7 million Net sales increase during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of acquisition-related growth of $347.3 million, partially offset by changes in foreign exchange rates which had a negative impact of $107.9 million. The $47.7 million Net sales decline due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2014 in comparison to 2013 was primarily the result of decreases in consumable volumes in most geographies. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2014 increased reflecting the positive impact of cost control activities. Additionally, Gross profit and gross profit margin during 2014 were positively impacted by the higher gross margins at Victor, which were partially offset by acquisition-related inventory step up expense of $9.0 million. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expense during 2014 was primarily due to an acquisition-related increase of $95.5 million and the foreign currency loss at our Venezuelan fabrication technology business discussed previously.\nWe have contracts in various stages of completion. Such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition. Significant management judgments and estimates, including estimated costs to complete projects, must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized during each period. Current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available. The revisions are recorded in income in the period in which they are determined using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.\nOperating Expenses - Total Company\nEquity Capital\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies\nBusiness Segments\nRevenue Recognition\n \u2022 Net cash received or paid for asbestos-related costs, net of insurance proceeds, including the disposition of claims, defense costs and legal expenses related to litigation against our insurers, creates variability in our operating cash flows. We had net cash outflows of $22.7 million, $32.7 million and $39.6 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n\nPricing\nIncome before income taxes was $358.2 million and the Benefit from income taxes was $62.0 million for 2014. The Benefit from income taxes was impacted by the reassessment of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets as a result of the effect of the Victor Acquisition on expected future U.S. income. This reassessment resulted in a decrease in the Company's valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. The reduction in the valuation allowance created a non-cash income tax benefit for 2014 of $145.4 million. Additionally, a tax benefit of $21.8 million was included in Benefit from income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income during 2014 associated with the resolution of a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. These items, as well as the impact of foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. tax rate, are the principal reasons for a tax benefit rather than a tax provision, which would result from the application of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the reported Income before income taxes for 2014.\nWe entered into a Second and Third amendment to the Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement on February 22, 2013 and November 7, 2013, respectively, which, among other things, reallocated our borrowing capacities of the tranches of loans and reduced our interest rate margins when compared to the terms of the amended Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement on January 13, 2012. In conjunction with the 2013 amendments, we recorded a charge to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $29.4 million to write-off certain deferred financing fees and original issue discount and expensed approximately $1.2 million of costs incurred in connection with the refinancing.\nGross Profit - Total Company\n (2) Excludes open purchase orders for goods or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which is not certain. \nWe have projected each subsidiary's future asbestos-related liability costs with regard to pending and future unasserted claims based upon the Nicholson methodology. The Nicholson methodology is a standard approach used by experts and has been accepted by numerous courts. This methodology is based upon risk equations, exposed population estimates, mortality rates, and other demographic statistics. In applying the Nicholson methodology for each subsidiary we performed: (1) an analysis of the estimated population likely to have been exposed or claim to have been exposed to products manufactured by the subsidiaries based upon national studies undertaken of the population of workers believed to have been exposed to asbestos; (2) a review of epidemiological and demographic studies to estimate the number of potentially exposed people that would be likely to develop asbestos-related diseases in each year; (3) an analysis of the subsidiaries' recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates for these diseases and (4) an analysis of the historical asbestos liability costs to develop average values, which vary by disease type, jurisdiction and the nature of claim, to determine an estimate of costs likely to be associated with currently pending and projected asbestos claims. Our projections, based upon the Nicholson methodology, estimate both claims and the estimated cash outflows related to the resolution of such claims for periods up to and including the endpoint of asbestos studies referred to in item (2) above. It is our policy to record a liability for asbestos-related liability costs for the longest period of time that we can reasonably estimate. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years.\n\u2022Overview\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $146.9 million during 2014 in comparison to 2013 primarily due to an increase of $161.8 million attributable to the addition of the operations associated with the Victor Acquisition and the gas- and fluid-handling acquisitions during 2013. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes the specific charges discussed above associated with impairment, loss on disposition of a business line and foreign currency, partially offset by significant cost saving programs in both segments and an unrealized gain of $2.9 million related to the Clarus contingent payment liability, as the performance criteria are no longer expected to be met. Restructuring and other related charges increased compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in restructuring actions to reduce structural costs and integrate the acquisitions made during 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013.\nOn November 29, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of GII for $246.0 million, including the assumption of debt, subject to certain adjustments. GII has operations around the world and expanded the Company's product offerings in the heavy duty industrial and cooling fan market.\nOverview\nOn May 13, 2013, we sold 7,500,000 shares of newly issued Colfax Common stock to underwriters for public resale pursuant to a shelf registration statement for an aggregate purchase price of $331.9 million. In conjunction with this issuance, we recognized $12.0 million in equity issuance costs which were recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital during 2013.\n\nWe complement our organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions can significantly affect our reported results and can complicate period to period comparisons of results. As a consequence, we report the change in our Net sales between periods both from existing and acquired businesses. Orders and order backlog are presented only for the gas- and fluid-handling segment, where this information is relevant. The change in Net sales due to acquisitions represents the change in sales due to the following acquisitions:\nBorrowing Arrangements\n(4) Represents the difference between prior year sales, orders and order backlog valued at the actual prior year foreign exchange rates and prior year sales, orders and order backlog valued at current year foreign exchange rates.\nDuring 2014, an analysis was performed on a trade name related to a specific operation within the gas- and fluid-handling segment prior to the annual impairment analysis due to the decision to substantially reduce its operations. The analysis determined the trade name was no longer recoverable based upon relief from royalty measurements and resulted in a $2.9 million impairment loss included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2014.\nCertain subsidiaries are each one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos. Such components were acquired from third-party suppliers, and were not manufactured by any of the Company's subsidiaries nor were the subsidiaries producers or direct suppliers of asbestos. The manufactured products that are alleged to have contained asbestos generally were provided to meet the specifications of the subsidiaries' customers, including the U.S. Navy.\nOn June 30, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Roots for $180.7 million. Roots is a leading supplier of blower and compressor technologies which service a broad range of end markets, including wastewater treatment, chemical production, and power generation. The acquisition builds on Howden's global strength in compressors and blowers and adds important application expertise and product solutions to the portfolio.\nOn June 5, 2015, we entered into the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the loans under the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement were used by us to repay in full balances under our preexisting Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. The 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement consists of a term loan in an aggregate amount of $750.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d) and a revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d), each of which matures in five years. The Revolver contains a $50.0 million swing line loan sub-facility.\nOn November 1, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of \u010cKDK for $69.4 million, including the assumption of debt. \u010cKDK is a leading supplier of multi-stage centrifugal compressors to the oil & gas, petrochemical, power and steel industries, based in Prague, Czech Republic.\nWe expect to continue to grow as a result of strategic acquisitions. We believe that the extensive experience of our leadership team in acquiring and effectively integrating acquisition targets should enable us to capitalize on opportunities in the future.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nOn September 30, 2013, the Company completed the acquisitions of TLT-Babcock and Alphair for an aggregate purchase price of $55.7 million. TLT-Babcock and Alphair are suppliers of heavy duty and industrial fans in Akron, Ohio and Winnipeg, Manitoba, respectively.\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our financial statements, see Note 3, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nA significant portion of our Net sales, approximately 72% for the year ended December 31, 2015, is derived from operations outside the U.S., with the majority of those sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because much of our manufacturing and employee costs are outside the U.S., a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nThe $170.3 million Net sales decrease due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2015 in comparison to 2014 was primarily due to declines in the power generation, mining, and general industrial and other end markets, partially offset by growth in the marine and oil, gas, and petrochemical end markets. Additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $225.4 million, partially offset by acquisition related growth of $47.9 million. Gross profit decreased during 2015, which was primarily the result of changes in foreign exchange rates and lower volumes. Gross profit margin increased during 2015 in comparison to 2014 as improved margins through cost control and restructuring savings were more than sufficient to offset the impact of lower volumes. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2015 primarily due to accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess in the cost structure of the Company in response to the current challenging, cyclical economic conditions. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2015 decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates, cost control activities and the impact of lower volumes, partially offset by acquisition-related growth, $8.1 million of charges associated with uncollectible accounts of a specific customer in South America, $2.8 million of asset impairment charges which includes a $1.7 million impairment loss related to a finite-lived intangible asset, approximately $8.0 million of transaction costs and year-one amortization charges associated with 2015 acquisitions, and a $4.1 million charge for revaluation of net asbestos-related liabilities. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes a $13.4 million impairment loss related to identifiable intangible assets, a $4.0 million loss on disposition of a small fluid-handling business line and a $1.3 million foreign currency loss from the use of the SICAD II exchange rate at our Venezuelan fluid-handling business, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $2.9 million related to the Clarus contingent payment liability.\n(3) Represents the incremental sales, orders and order backlog as a result of our acquisitions.\nand solvency of the various insurers, and employed such insurance allocation methodologies as we believed appropriate to ascertain the probable insurance recoveries for asbestos liabilities. The analysis took into account self-insurance retentions, policy exclusions, pending litigation, liability caps and gaps in coverage, existing and potential insolvencies of insurers as well as how legal and defense costs will be covered under the insurance policies.\nWe assessed the subsidiaries' existing insurance arrangements and agreements, estimated the applicability of insurance coverage for existing and expected future claims, analyzed publicly available information bearing on the current creditworthiness\nColfax has a global geographic footprint, with production facilities in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Australia and Africa. Through our reportable segments, we serve a global customer base across multiple markets through a combination of direct sales and third-party distribution channels. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial, industrial and government customers.\nOur products and services are available worldwide. The manner in which our products and services are sold differs by region. During 2015, approximately 74% of our sales were shipped to locations outside of the U.S. Accordingly, we are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic and political factors in countries throughout the world. Our ability to grow and our financial performance will be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations, including efficiently utilizing our global sales, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, the expansion of market opportunities in Asia, successfully completing global strategic acquisitions and engineering innovative new product applications for end users in a variety of geographic markets. However, we believe that our geographic, end market and product diversification may limit the impact that any one country or economy could have on our consolidated results.\nThe $172.6 million increase in Gross profit during 2014 in comparison to 2013 was attributable to increases of $70.0 million and $102.6 million in our gas- and fluid-handling segment and our fabrication technology segment, respectively. The increase in gross profit margin in both of our segments during 2014 reflects the positive impact of cost control activities. Additionally, our fabrication technology segment was positively impacted during 2014 by the higher gross margins of Victor, which were partially offset by acquisition-related inventory step up expense. The increase in Gross profit in our gas- and fluid-handling segment during 2014 includes the impact of acquisitions, which also served to reduce gross profit margin. Changes in foreign exchange rates during 2014 had a $44.0 million negative impact on Gross profit.\nManagement's analyses are based on currently known facts and a number of assumptions. However, projecting future events, such as new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of resolving each claim, coverage issues among layers of insurers, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, the continuing solvency of various insurance companies, the amount of remaining insurance available, as well as the numerous uncertainties inherent in asbestos litigation could cause the actual liabilities and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than those projected or recorded which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nFabrication Technology\nOverview\nThe $227.0 million decrease in Gross profit during 2015 in comparison to 2014 was attributable to decreases of $102.3 million and $124.7 million in our gas- and fluid-handling segment and our fabrication technology segment, respectively. The decrease in gross profit in both of our segments during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates and lower overall volumes, partially offset by acquisition related growth. The increase in gross profit margin in our gas- and fluid-handling segment during 2015 as compared to 2014 was more than offset by the lower gross profit margin at fabrication technology. Changes in foreign exchange rates during 2015 had a $169.0 million negative impact on Gross profit.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $105.2 million during 2015 in comparison to 2014. Changes in foreign exchange rates during 2015 decreased Selling, general, and administrative expenses by primarily $111.3 million. An overall decrease in acquisition integration costs and the positive benefit of restructuring actions to reduce structural costs and integrate acquisitions also contributed to the decrease. These items were partially offset by a $40.4 million acquisition-related increase in Selling, general and administrative expense during 2015. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2015 includes an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of specific South American customers of $9.4 million, asset impairment charges of $4.3 million, and transaction costs and year-one amortization of approximately $8.0 million, as discussed previously. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of Net sales increased primarily as a result of lower Net sales driven by reasons discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes a $13.4 million impairment loss related to identifiable intangible assets, a $4.0 million loss on disposition of a small fluid-handling business line and a $6.3 million loss from the use of the SICAD II exchange rate at our Venezuelan businesses. The increase in Restructuring and other related charges during 2015 is attributable to our gas- and fluid-handling segment due to accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess in the cost structure of the Company in response to the current challenging, cyclical economic conditions.\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire pool of customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $39.5 million and $27.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The current year increase was primarily driven by an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of specific South American customers of $9.4 million. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required.\nThe decrease in Net sales from existing businesses during 2015 compared to 2014 was attributable to decreases of $170.3 million and $134.2 million in our gas- and fluid-handling and fabrication technology segments, respectively. Orders, net of cancellations, from existing businesses for our gas- and fluid-handling segment decreased during 2015 in comparison to 2014 due to declining demand in all end markets from unfavorable domestic and international macroeconomic conditions.\nContinuation of the decline in oil prices increases the risk of impairments next year. Actual results could differ from our estimates and projections, which would also affect the assessment of impairment. As of December 31, 2015, we have Goodwill of $2.8 billion and indefinite lived trade names of $395.3 million that are subject to at least annual review for impairment. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nHistorically, we have financed our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuances of equity. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital, funding of acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, asbestos-related cash outflows and funding of our pension plans. If additional funds are needed for strategic acquisitions or other corporate purposes, we believe we could raise additional funds in the form of debt or equity.\n\nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for our gas- and fluid-handling segment:\nEconomic Conditions\nThe following discussion of Results of Operations addresses the comparison of the periods presented. The Company's management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon Net sales and segment operating income (loss), which represents Operating income (loss) before Restructuring and other related charges.\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe measure fair value of reporting units based on a present value of future discounted cash flows and a market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that the reporting units are expected to generate in the future. Significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: the weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the Company against certain market information. Significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying appropriate market multiples and assessing earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.\nDemand for our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance by our customers. The level of capital expenditures depends, in turn, on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. While demand can be cyclical, we believe that our diversified operations generally limit the impact of a downturn in any one market on our consolidated results. However, we are currently in the midst of a sustained decline in commodity prices, including oil, which has had a negative impact on the levels of capital invested and maintenance expenditures by certain of our customers which in turn has reduced the demand for our products and services.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe believe our customers place a premium on quality, reliability, availability, design and application engineering support. Our highly engineered gas- and fluid-handling products typically have higher margins than products with commodity-like qualities. However, we are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for components and raw materials including steel, iron, copper and aluminum. Historically, we have been generally successful in passing raw material price increases on to our customers. While we seek to take actions to manage this risk, including commodity hedging where appropriate, such increased costs may adversely impact earnings.\nSales and Cost Mix\nThe following MD&A should be read together with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The MD&A includes forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in these forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe $31.3 million Net sales decrease due to existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, during 2014 in comparison to 2013 was primarily due to declines in the oil, gas and petrochemical, power generation and marine end markets, partially offset by growth in the mining and general industrial and other end markets. Additionally, Net sales increased by $287.9 million due to acquisitions and changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $31.0 million. Gross profit increased during 2014 reflecting the impact of acquisitions. Gross profit margin increased during 2014 in comparison to 2013 as improved margins through cost control and restructuring savings in our gas-handling business were more than sufficient to offset the lower margins of the acquired entities. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2014 primarily due to an increase in restructuring actions to reduce structural costs and integrate the acquisitions made during the fourth quarter of 2013. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a $66.3 million increase due to acquisitions and the specific 2014 charges discussed previously.\nWe expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to continue to negatively impact our overall results of operations in 2016 as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.\nEach subsidiary has separate insurance coverage acquired prior to our ownership of each independent entity. In our evaluation of the insurance asset, we use differing insurance allocation methodologies for each subsidiary based upon the applicable law pertaining to the affected subsidiary.\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in working capital and the timing of payments for items such as pension funding and asbestos-related costs. Changes in significant operating cash flow items are discussed below.\nOutlook\n\u2022Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\nSeasonality\nThe Term Loan and the Revolver bear interest, at the election of the Company, at either the base rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement) or the Eurocurrency rate (as defined in the 2015 Deutsche Bank Credit Agreement), in each case, plus the applicable interest rate margin. The Term Loan and the Revolver initially bear interest either at the Eurocurrency rate plus 1.50% or at the base rate plus 0.50% , and in future quarters will bear interest either at the Eurocurrency rate or the base rate plus the applicable interest rate margin based upon either, whichever results in the lower applicable interest rate margin (subject to certain exceptions), the Company's total leverage ratio and the corporate family rating of the Company as determined by Standard & Poor's and Moody's (ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% , in the case of the Eurocurrency margin, and 0.25% to 1.00% ,

business segments: Gas and Fluid Handling, and Fabrication Technology. \n- 72% of 2015 net sales were outside the U.S. Results are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n- Strategic acquisitions are used to drive growth, including the 2015 acquisitions of Roots and Simsmart.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Net sales decreased 14.2% from 2014 to 2015, driven by a 6.6% decline in existing businesses and 11.3% negative foreign currency translation impact, partially offset by acquisition growth. \n- Gross profit and margin decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to foreign exchange rates and lower volumes.\n- Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to foreign exchange rates, cost controls, and lower volumes, partially offset by acquisition impacts.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Cash flows from operations were $303.8 million in 2015. Cash outflows related to acquisitions and capital expenditures were partially offset by lower working capital needs.  \n- Debt refinancing in 2015 resulted in a small non-cash write-off of deferred financing fees but extended debt maturity.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies & Estimates  \n- Key policies relate to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, income taxes, and asbestos liabilities and insurance assets. These involve significant management judgment and estimates.\n\nOutlook\n- Foreign exchange rate changes expected to continue negatively impacting results in 2016. Lower oil prices increase risk of future asset impairments."}
