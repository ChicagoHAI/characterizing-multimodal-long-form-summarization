Its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Midland States Bank, has branches across Illinois and in Missouri, and provides a full range of commercial and consumer banking products and services, business equipment financing, merchant credit card services, trust and investment management, and insurance and financial planning services. In addition, multifamily and healthcare facility FHA financing is provided through Love Funding, our non-bank subsidiary. As of December 31, 2019, we had $6.09 billion in assets, $4.54 billion of deposits and $661.9 million of shareholders' equity.\nOur strategic plan is focused on building a performance-based, customer-centric culture, seeking accretive acquisitions, creating revenue diversification, achieving operational excellence and maintaining a robust enterprise-wide risk management program. Over the past several years, we have grown organically and through a series of acquisitions, with an over-arching focus on enhancing shareholder value and building a platform for scalability. Most recently, in July 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of HomeStar and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, HomeStar Bank. In February 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Alpine and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Alpine Bank. In June 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Centrue and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Centrue Bank. In March 2017, we acquired CedarPoint, an SEC registered investment advisory firm, which was renamed Midland Financial Advisors, Inc. following the acquisition. Additional information on recent acquisitions is presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur principal lines of business include traditional community banking, wealth management, and commercial FHA origination and servicing. Our traditional community banking business primarily consists of commercial and retail lending and deposit taking with a total loan portfolio of $4.40 billion and total deposits of $4.54 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our wealth management group provides a comprehensive suite of trust and wealth management products and services, and has grown to $3.41 billion of assets under administration as of December 31, 2019. Our commercial FHA business, which originates commercial mortgage loans for multifamily and healthcare facilities under FHA insurance programs, had $347.4 million of originations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur principal business activity has been lending to and accepting deposits from individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities. We have derived income principally from interest charged on loans and leases and, to a lesser extent, from interest and dividends earned on investment securities. We have also derived income from noninterest sources, such as: fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services; wealth management services; commercial FHA mortgage loan originations, sales and servicing; residential mortgage loan originations and sales; and, from time to time, gains on sales of assets. Our principal expenses include interest expense on deposits and borrowings, operating expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, data processing costs, professional fees and other noninterest expenses, provisions for loan losses and income tax expense.\nPrimary Factors Affecting Comparability\nEach factor listed below materially affects the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition in 2019, 2018 and 2017, and may affect the comparability of financial information we report in future fiscal periods.\nCapital Raising Transactions. On September 20, 2019, we issued, through a private placement, $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes, which was structured into two tranches: (1) $72.75 million, maturing on September 30, 2029 with a redemption option on or after September 30, 2024, with a fixed rate of interest of 5.00% for the first five years and a floating rate of interest equivalent to three-month SOFR plus 361.0 basis points thereafter,\nand (2) $27.25 million, maturing on September 30, 2034 with a redemption option on or after September 30, 2029, with a fixed interest rate of 5.50% for the first ten years and a floating rate of interest equivalent to the three-month SOFR plus 404.5 basis points thereafter. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay a $30.0 million senior term loan and intends to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem existing subordinated debt which is redeemable in June 2020, and for general corporate purposes.\nIn October 2017, we issued subordinated notes totaling $40.0 million, maturing on October 15, 2027, with a fixed rate of interest of 6.25% for the first five years and a floating rate of interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 422.9 basis points thereafter.\nIn May 2017, we entered into a loan agreement with another bank for a revolving line of credit in the original principal amount of up to $10.0 million and a term loan in the original principal amount of $40.0 million. In September 2019, the Company paid off the term loan from the proceeds received from the issuance of subordinated debt discussed above and terminated the revolving line of credit.\nPreferred Stock Repurchase. On July 29, 2019, we redeemed, in whole, the shares of the Company's Series H preferred stock. The price paid by the Company for such shares was equal to $1,000 per share plus any unpaid dividends.\nRecent Acquisitions. On July 17, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of HomeStar and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, HomeStar Bank, which operated five full-service banking centers in northern Illinois. The Company acquired $367.2 million in assets, including $211.1 million in loans, and assumed $321.7 million in deposits.\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Alpine and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Alpine Bank, which operated 19 locations principally in and around the Rockford, Illinois area. The Company acquired $1.24 billion in assets, including $786.2 million in loans, and assumed $1.11 billion in deposits.\nOn June 9, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Centrue and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Centrue Bank, which operated 20 full-service banking centers located principally in northern Illinois. The Company acquired $990.2 million in assets, including $679.6 million in loans, and assumed $739.9 million in deposits.\nPurchased Loans. Our net interest margin benefits from favorable changes in expected cash flows on our PCI loans and from accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on the non-purchased credit impaired loans ( Non-PCI loans\u201d) included in our acquisitions. Our reported net interest margins were 3.69%, 3.76% and 3.77% for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on loans acquired totaled $12.6 million, $13.4 million and $9.7 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing the reported margins by 22, 24 and 25 basis points for each respective period.\nMortgage Servicing Rights. The Company sells residential and commercial FHA mortgage loans in the secondary market. Mortgage servicing rights ( MSR\u201d) resulting from us retaining the right to service the loans sold are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value. MSR are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assessed for impairment at each reporting date.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we committed to a plan to sell our Fannie Mae residential mortgage servicing rights and transferred $14.2 million of residential MSR, net of valuation allowances, to MSR held for sale. As a result, we recognized a $4.1 million loss in 2017 on MSR held for sale to reflect the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. After recognizing this loss, MSR held for sale had a net carrying value of $10.2 million at December 31, 2017. We sold our Fannie Mae residential mortgage servicing rights on January 2, 2018.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company transferred the remaining $3.6 million of residential MSR to MSR held for sale. A gain of $0.5 million was recognized on MSR held for sale during 2019 and a loss of $0.5 million was recognized on MSR held for sale in 2018. In 2017, we recognized $0.8 million of impairment charges on our residential mortgage servicing rights. In 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $2.1 million on our commercial FHA mortgage servicing rights compared to $0.5 million in recoveries of previously recorded impairment charges in 2018 and impairment charges of $1.5 million in 2017.\nBranch Optimization Plan. In the first quarter of 2017, we closed seven banking offices as a result of the branch network optimization plan that we announced in November 2016. In 2017, the Company announced the closure of six additional banking facilities as a result of the acquisition of Centrue. Consequently, we recorded $2.0 million of asset impairment in 2017 on these banking facilities. There was no impairment recorded in 2018. We had $1.7 million and $3.4 million of branch-related assets classified in other assets as held for sale at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIn 2019, the Company closed one facility and consolidated two additional facilities as a result of the acquisition of HomeStar. In addition, the Company planned to consolidate three other existing facilities in other areas of its footprint, one of which closed in 2019 and the remaining two facilities closed in January 2020. Consequently, in 2019, the Company recorded $3.2 million of asset impairment on banking facilities to be closed. We had $4.0 million of branch-related assets classified as held for sale in other assets at December 31, 2019.\nMaterial Trends and Developments\nEconomic and Interest Rate Environment. The results of our operations are highly dependent on economic conditions and market interest rates. Over the past several years, economic conditions in the U.S. and our primary market areas have improved. Economic growth has been modest, the real estate market continues to improve and unemployment rates in the U.S. and our primary markets have remained low.\nCapital Raising Initiatives. One component of our initiative-driven strategic plan is to pursue accretive acquisitions. We have been able to implement our acquisition strategy due to several significant capital raising transactions. These transactions are described above in the section under Primary Factors Affecting Comparability-Capital Raising Transactions.\u201d These capital raising transactions have also supported our organic growth strategies.\nCommunity Banking. We believe the most important trends affecting community banks in the United States over the foreseeable future will be related to heightened regulatory capital requirements, increasing regulatory burdens generally, including the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations to be promulgated thereunder, and interest margin compression. We expect that community banks will face increased competition for lower cost capital as a result of regulatory policies that may offer larger financial institutions greater access to government assistance than is available for smaller institutions, including community banks. We expect that troubled community banks will continue to face significant challenges when attempting to raise capital. We also believe that heightened regulatory capital requirements will make it more difficult for even well-capitalized, healthy community banks to grow in their communities by taking advantage of opportunities in their markets that result as the economy continues to improve. We believe these trends will favor community banks that have sufficient capital, a diversified business model and a strong deposit franchise, and we believe we possess these characteristics.\nWe also believe that increased regulatory burdens will have a significant adverse effect on smaller community banks, which often lack the personnel, experience and technology to efficiently comply with new regulations in a variety of areas in the banking industry, including in the areas of deposits, lending, compensation, information security and overdraft protection. We believe the increased costs to smaller community banks from a more complex regulatory environment, coupled with challenges in the real estate lending area, present attractive acquisition opportunities for larger community banks that have already made significant investments in regulatory compliance and risk management and can acquire and quickly integrate these smaller institutions into their existing platform. Furthermore, we believe that, as a result of our significant operational investments and our experience acquiring other institutions and quickly integrating them into our organization, we are well positioned to capitalize on the challenges facing smaller community banks.\nWe continue to believe we have significant opportunities for further growth through additional acquisitions of banks, branches, wealth management firms and trust departments of community banks, selective de novo opportunities, continued expansion of our wealth management operations, the hiring of commercial banking and wealth management professionals from other organizations and organic growth within our existing branch network. We also believe we have the necessary experience, management and infrastructure to take advantage of these growth opportunities.\nCredit Reserves. One of our key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintenance of an appropriate level of reserve protection against probable losses in our loan portfolio. In 2019, our provision for loan losses was $17.0 million compared to $9.4 million in 2018 and $9.6 million in 2017.\nAs noted above, we recorded PCI loans at estimated fair value on their acquisition date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. As a result of adding $211.1 million of loans from the acquisition of HomeStar, $786.2 million of loans from the acquisition of Alpine and $679.6 million of loans from the acquisition of Centrue, combined with net loan charge-offs of $9.9 million, $5.0 million and $8.0 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased to 0.64% at December 31, 2019 from 0.51% and 0.51% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Although the recent acquisitions have generally kept the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans ratio low, the additional specific reserves recorded in 2019 offset the benefit from the acquisition of HomeStar, causing the increase in the allowance for loan losses.\nRegulatory Environment. As a result of regulatory changes, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Rule, we expect to be subject to more restrictive capital requirements, more stringent asset concentration and growth limitations and new and potentially heightened examination and reporting requirements. We also expect to face a more challenging environment for customer loan demand due to the increased costs that could be ultimately borne by borrowers, and to incur higher costs to comply with these new regulations. This uncertain regulatory environment could have a detrimental impact on our ability to manage our business consistent with historical practices and cause difficulty in executing our growth plan. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Business Environment and Our Industry\u201d and Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nFor discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017, refer to Item 7 of the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019.\nOverview. In 2019, we generated net income of $55.8 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $2.26, compared to $39.4 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $1.66, in 2018 and $16.1 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $0.87, in 2017. The 2019 earnings included a $9.7 million increase in net interest income, a $3.5 million increase in noninterest income and a $16.0 million decrease in noninterest expense. These results were partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in the provision for loan losses and a $5.3 million increase in income tax expense. The successful conversion and integration of our acquisition of HomeStar, our strong business development highlighted by growth in both loans and deposits and our focus on developing new depository products for commercial customers had a positive impact on our core deposit gathering, resulting in a steady improvement in our deposit mix, and all contributed to positive 2019 performance when compared to 2018.\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement information of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Statement Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 249,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 223,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 153,113\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,451\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 189,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 180,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,662\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,556\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,362\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152,997\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,471\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,415\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,056\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income available to common shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 55,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 39,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 15,973\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0.89\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0.87\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis\nThe following table presents average balance sheet information, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period's average rate.

Income. Net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest-earning assets (primarily loans and securities) and interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings), is our primary source of revenue, comprising of 71.6% of 2019 revenues. Net interest income is impacted by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders' equity, also support earning assets. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets and is presented on a tax-equivalent basis to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield on a taxable asset. We used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% for 2019 and 2018.\nAs described above, one of the factors that impacts net interest income is interest rate fluctuations. The Federal Reserve implemented quarterly interest rate increases in 2018, with the last increase of 25 basis points in December 2018. These increases impact the comparability of net interest income between 2018 and 2019 because the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates by 75 basis points in the second half of 2019.\nNet interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $191.9 million in 2019, a $9.7 million, or 5.3%, increase from $182.2 million in 2018. The increase in net interest income in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher average earning assets resulting from the addition of loans from the acquisition of HomeStar. This was partially offset by higher interest-bearing liabilities resulting from the addition of interest-bearing deposits from the acquisition of\nHomeStar, as well as increased usage of FHLB advances as a funding source and the issuance of subordinated debt in September 2019.\nInterest income on loans increased $15.7 million and $8.4 million due to volume and rate, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in volume was primarily due to $211.1 million of loans and $3.6 million of loans held for sale added from the acquisition of HomeStar, and $255.4 million of growth in our equipment financing loan portfolio from $376.1 million in 2018. The reported yield on total loans was 5.27% and 5.06% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in yield on loans was primarily driven by the impact of higher market interest rates and accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on loans acquired, which totaled $12.6 million and $13.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, increasing the reported yields by 22 and 24 basis points for each respective period.\nInterest expense on deposits increased to $34.2 million from $22.1 million in 2018. The $12.1 million increase was primarily due to an increase of $10.3 million and $1.8 million in rate and volume of deposits, respectively. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to higher interest rates paid on deposits due to the impact of higher market interest rates. The increase in volume was primarily attributable to the addition of $321.7 million of deposits added from the acquisition of HomeStar, and an increase in our average balances of $227.9 million from our new Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d) product offering. With the increase in deposits from the acquisition of HomeStar and organically, we have been able to replace, in part, wholesale funds through the intentional decrease in brokered time deposits which results in lower average rate paid on deposits.\nInterest expense on subordinated debt increased $1.3 million to $7.4 million due primarily to the issuance of $100.0 million of subordinated debt in September 2019. The increase was partially offset by the redemption of $16.5 million of subordinated debt during the fourth quarter of 2019. In turn, the reported yield decreased 24 basis points to 6.20% in 2019.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses totaled $17.0 million in 2019 compared to $9.4 million in 2018. The increase in provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to an increase in charge-offs and an increase specific reserves established on nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio during 2019, coupled with growth of our loan portfolio and the resultant increase in required reserves.\nNoninterest Income.

Noninterest income from our wealth management business increased $1.3 million primarily due to an increase in trust and estate fees, the addition of $181.2 million of assets under administration added from the acquisition of HomeStar, and a full year's effect of the addition of $1.0 billion of wealth management assets under administration from the acquisition of Alpine in February 2018.\nCommercial FHA revenue. The increase of $2.2 million in commercial FHA revenue was primarily driven by an increase in gain premiums, partially offset by lower loan costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest rate lock commitments increased to $307.9 million in 2019 from $236.6 million in 2018. Additionally, originations increased to $347.4 million in 2019 from $314.7 million in 2018. These increases were partially offset by an\nimpairment charge of $2.1 million in 2019 as compared to a $0.5 million recovery of previous impairment charges in 2018.\nResidential mortgage banking revenue. The decrease of $2.8 million in residential mortgage banking revenue reflected declines in closed production and interest rate lock commitments that were due in part to a smaller loan production team. In addition, servicing fees decreased as a result of the sale and transfer of mortgage servicing rights in 2018 and 2019. In late 2017, the Company had committed to a plan to sell mortgage servicing rights, resulting in the transfer of serviced residential mortgage loans for others to residential mortgage servicing rights held for sale.\nInterchange revenue. Noninterest income from interchange revenue increased $1.3 million due primarily to an increased level of debit card activity primarily as a result of the acquisition of HomeStar and a full year of debit card activity related to accounts acquired from Alpine.\nOther noninterest income. The increase of $1.0 million in other noninterest income reflected an increase in bridge loan fees from Love Funding as well as servicing fees and gain on sale of SBA loans acquired from HomeStar. The increase was partially offset by a gain on proceeds from our bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) program in 2018 that did not recur in 2019.\nNoninterest Expense.

The $5.5 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily driven by change in control payments, severance costs and other benefit-related expenses in 2018 related to the acquisition of Alpine. The decrease in expense was offset by an increase in severance and change in control costs associated with the acquisition of HomeStar in 2019.\nData processing. The $4.5 million decrease in data processing expense primarily resulted from contract termination fees and system conversion charges in 2018 associated with the acquisition of Alpine.\nFDIC insurance. The $1.4 million decrease in FDIC insurance was primarily due to small business tax credits received from the FDIC. The credit was awarded by the FDIC to banks with total consolidated assets less than $10.0 billion for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the FDIC's reserve ratio. The Company has recognized $0.9 million in credits and expects to recognize additional credits of $0.6 million in future periods.\nProfessional fees. The $4.0 million decrease in professional fees was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees incurred on various technology and other integration related projects in 2018 associated primarily with the acquisition of Alpine.\nCommunication fees. The $1.4 million decrease in communication fees was primarily due to integration and acquisition expenses in 2018 associated with the acquisition of Alpine.\nOther noninterest expense. The $2.5 million increase in other noninterest expense was primarily due to $3.2 million of asset impairment in 2019 on one banking facility that was closed in 2019 and two additional banking facilities that were closed in the first quarter of 2020 related to our branch network consolidation plan. Additionally, in 2019, we recognized a $1.8 million loss on the repurchase of subordinated debt. These increases were partially offset by costs associated with supplies, insurance, travel, meals, postage and training incurred in 2018 related to the acquisitions of Centrue and Alpine.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $16.7 million in 2019 compared to $11.4 million in 2018. Effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 were 23.0% and 22.4%, respectively. The increase of the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the BOLI death benefit recorded in 2018.\nFinancial Condition\nAssets. Total assets increased $449.3 million to $6.09 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. This increase primarily reflected the addition of $367.2 million of assets from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nLoans. The loan portfolio is the largest category of our assets.

for loan losses increased $256.7 million to $4.37 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to $211.1 million of loans added from the acquisition of HomeStar. Also contributing to the growth was organic loan growth primarily from our equipment financing business, which is booked in the commercial loans and lease financing portfolios. These increases were partially offset by several large loan payoffs and principal reductions in the commercial real estate portfolio during 2019. The $0.3 million decrease in PCI loans at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 reflected loan payoffs and repayments made throughout the year, partially offset by the addition of $17.6 million of PCI loans from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nOutstanding loan balances increased due to new loan originations, advances on outstanding commitments and loans acquired as a result of acquisitions of other financial institutions, net of amounts received for loan payments and payoffs, charge-offs of loans and transfers of loans to other real estate owned.

We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial loans. The loans are typically made to small- and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital needs, business expansions and farm operations. Commercial loans generally include lines of credit and loans with maturities of five years or less. The loans are generally made with business operations as the primary source of repayment, but may also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable and equipment, and generally include personal guarantees.\nCommercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans consist of both real estate occupied by the borrower for ongoing operations and non-owner occupied real estate properties. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a wide variety of property types, such as owner occupied offices, warehouses and production facilities, office buildings, hotels, mixed-use residential and commercial facilities, retail centers, multifamily properties and assisted living facilities. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio also includes farmland loans. Farmland loans are generally made to a borrower actively involved in farming rather than to passive investors.\nConstruction and land development loans. Our construction and land development loans are comprised of residential construction, commercial construction and land acquisition and development loans. Interest reserves are generally established on real estate construction loans.\nResidential real estate loans. Our residential real estate loans consist of loans for the purchase of residential properties that generally do not qualify for secondary market sale.\nConsumer loans. Our consumer loans include direct personal loans, indirect automobile loans, lines of credit and installment loans originated through home improvement specialty retailers and contractors. Personal loans are generally secured by automobiles, boats and other types of personal property and are made on an installment basis.\nLease financing. Our equipment leasing business provides financing leases to varying types of businesses, nationwide, for purchases of business equipment and software. The financing is secured by a first priority interest in the financed asset and generally requires monthly payments.\nThe following table shows the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio and the distribution between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans at December 31, 2019:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Within One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjustable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjustable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjustable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 41,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 316,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 389,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 60,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 191,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 56,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,055,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 234,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 698,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 134,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 298,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,526,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 208,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 294,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 445,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,125,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 275,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 272,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 377,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,790,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 219,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 279,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 568,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 678,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 710,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 290,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 332,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 308,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 457,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,112,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 334,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 531,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 657,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,401,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan Quality\nWe use what we believe is a comprehensive methodology to monitor credit quality and prudently manage credit concentration within our loan portfolio. Our underwriting policies and practices govern the risk profile and credit and geographic concentration for our loan portfolio. We also have what we believe to be a comprehensive methodology to monitor these credit quality standards, including a risk classification system that identifies potential problem loans based on risk characteristics by loan type as well as the early identification of deterioration at the individual loan level. In addition to our allowance for loan losses, our purchase discounts on acquired loans provide additional protections against credit losses.\nDiscounts on PCI Loans. PCI loans are loans that have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. These loans are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses.\nThe following table shows the composition of PCI loans within our portfolio at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

payments due, which represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payments, adjusted for the effect of estimated prepayments. We then estimate the undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect. We incorporate several key assumptions to estimate cash flows expected to be collected, including probability of default rates, loss given default assumptions and the amount and timing of prepayments. We calculate fair value by discounting the estimated cash flows we expect to collect using an observable market rate of interest, when available, adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value. We have aggregated certain credit-impaired loans acquired in the same transaction into pools based on common risk characteristics. A pool is accounted for as one asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate fair value and expected cash flows.\nThe difference between contractually required payments due and the cash flows expected to be collected, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference, which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, reflects estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, but is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loans, or pool of loans, using the effective yield method. The outstanding customer balance for PCI loans totaled $51.9 million and $56.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSubsequent to an acquisition, we periodically evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent changes in the estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassifications between accretable yield and the nonaccretable difference. Decreases in expected cash flows due to further credit deterioration will result in an impairment charge to the provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses and a reclassification from accretable yield to nonaccretable difference. Increases in expected cash flows due to credit improvements will result in an increase in the accretable yield through a reclassification from the nonaccretable difference or as a reduction in the allowance for loan losses to the extent established on specific pools subsequent to acquisition. The adjusted accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans.\nThe following table shows changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 12,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 9,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New loans purchased - HomeStar acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New loans purchased - Alpine acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New loans purchased - Centrue acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,423)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,092)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,546)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments (including maturities, charge-offs and impact of changes in timing of expected cash flows)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reclassification from non-accretable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 12,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 12,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, the balance of accretable discounts on our PCI loan portfolio was $12.1 million compared to $12.2 million at December 31, 2018.

$28.0 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $20.9 million at December 31, 2018. The $7.1 million increase in the allowance was mainly attributable to a $4.7 million increase in specific reserves related primarily to commercial loans that were classified as nonaccrual during 2019.\nIndividual loans considered to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance. Factors used in determining the amount and timing of charge-offs on loans include consideration of the loan type, length of delinquency, sufficiency of collateral value, lien priority and the overall financial condition of the borrower. Collateral value is determined using updated appraisals and/or other market comparable information. Charge-offs are generally taken on loans once the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance. Net charge-offs to average loans were 0.23% and 0.13% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe allowance and the balance of nonaccretable discounts represent our estimate of probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in loans held for investment as of the respective balance sheet date. We assess the appropriateness of our allowance for non-PCI loans separately from our allowance for PCI loans.\nAllowance for non-PCI loans. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for non-PCI loans includes a general allowance for performing loans, which are grouped based on similar characteristics, and a specific allowance for individual impaired loans or loans considered by management to be in a high risk category. General allowances are established based on a number of factors, including historical loss rates, an assessment of portfolio trends and conditions, accrual status and economic conditions.\nFor commercial, commercial real estate and construction and land development loans, a specific allowance may be assigned to individual loans based on an impairment analysis. Loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The amount of impairment is based on an analysis of the most probable source of repayment, including the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows and the estimated market value or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Interest income on impaired loans is accrued as earned, unless the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.\nAllowance for PCI loans. PCI loans are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, with the estimated fair value including a component for estimated credit losses. An allowance related to PCI loans may be recorded subsequent to acquisition if a PCI loan pool experiences a decrease in expected cash flows as compared to the expected cash flows projected in the previous quarter. Loans considered to be uncollectible are initially charged off against the specific loan pool's non-accretable difference. When the pool's non-accretable difference has been fully utilized, uncollectible amounts are charged off against the corresponding allowance.

The following table sets forth our nonperforming assets by asset categories as of the dates indicated. Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and loans modified under troubled debt restructurings. The balances of impaired loans reflect the net investment in these assets,\nincluding deductions for purchase discounts. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming status because we expect to fully collect their new carrying values, which reflect significant purchase discounts. If our expectation of reasonably estimable future cash flows from PCI loans deteriorates, the loans may be classified as nonaccrual loans, and interest income will not be recognized until the timing and amount of future cash flows can be reasonably estimated.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impaired loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 398\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total impaired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned and other repossessed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 50,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 45,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 30,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 34,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impaired loans to total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming assets to total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not recognize any interest income on nonaccrual loans during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 while they were in nonaccrual status.

In connection with examinations of insured institutions, examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard,\u201d doubtful,\u201d and loss.\u201d Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable and there is a high probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. An asset classified as loss is not considered collectable and is of such little value that continuance of booking the asset is not warranted.\nWe use a ten grade risk rating system to categorize and determine the credit risk of our loans. Potential problem loans include loans with a risk grade of 7, which are \"special mention,\" and loans with a risk grade of 8, which are \"substandard\" loans that are not considered to be impaired. These loans generally require more frequent loan officer contact and receipt of financial data to closely monitor borrower performance. Potential problem loans are managed and monitored regularly through a number of processes, procedures and committees, including oversight by a loan administration committee comprised of executive officers and other members of the Bank's senior management team.\nThe following table presents the recorded investment of potential problem commercial loans (excluding PCI loans) by loan category at the dates indicated:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Construction &\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Real Estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Land Development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Risk Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Risk Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Risk Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 17,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 22,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 18,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 66,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 128,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>Includes only those 8-rated loans that are not included in nonperforming loans. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Securities.

We adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019, which required the recognition of operating lease right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) assets. Operating lease ROU assets represent the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, specified assets for the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets totaled $14.2 million at December 31, 2019.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill was $171.8 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $164.7 million at December 31, 2018. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid in an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The $7.1 million increase in 2019 resulted from goodwill associated with the acquisition of HomeStar.\nOur other intangible assets, which consist of core deposit and trust relationship intangibles, were $34.9 million and $37.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in other intangibles was due to amortization expense of $7.1 million, partially offset by the $4.6 million in acquired intangibles from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nLiabilities. Total liabilities increased to $5.43 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $5.03 billion at December 31, 2018. This increase primarily reflected the addition of $362.9 million of liabilities from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nDeposits. We emphasize developing total client relationships with our customers in order to increase our retail and commercial core deposit bases, which are our primary funding sources. Our deposits consist of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings and time deposit accounts.\nThe following table summarizes our average deposit balances and weighted average rates for

This increase primarily resulted from $321.7 million of deposits added from the acquisition of HomeStar and organic growth, partially offset by an intentional reduction in brokered money market deposits and brokered time deposits. At December 31, 2019, total deposits were comprised of 22.4% of noninterest-bearing demand accounts, 58.4% of interest-bearing transaction accounts and 19.2% of time deposits. At December 31, 2019, brokered deposits totaled $49.7 million, or 1.1% of total deposits, compared to $161.6 million, or 4.0% of total deposits, at December 31, 2018.\nShort-Term Borrowings. In addition to deposits, we use short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, as a source of funds to meet the daily liquidity needs of\nour customers and fund growth in earning assets. Short-term borrowings were $82.0 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $124.2 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by customers migrating to a new deposit product. The weighted average interest rate on our short-term borrowings was 0.67% and 0.71% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFHLB Advances and Other Borrowings. FHLB advances and other borrowings totaled $493.3 million and $640.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease of $147.3 million was primarily due to $482.2 million and $32.9 million of payments made on FHLB borrowings and other borrowings, respectively, partially offset by $360.0 million of additional FHLB borrowings during 2019.\nOperating Lease Liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019 also required the recognition of operating lease liabilities. Operating lease liabilities represent a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis. Operating lease liabilities totaled $15.4 million at December 31, 2019.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Management\nCapital Resources. Shareholders' equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, sales and redemptions of common stock and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities.\nShareholders' equity increased $53.4 million to $661.9 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity was due primarily to the generation of net income of $55.8 million, $10.3 million of common equity issued for the acquisition of HomeStar, and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $9.6 million, partially offset by $23.6 million of declared dividends to common shareholders and $2.6 million of Series H preferred stock redemptions.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of HomeStar, the Company paid $1.0 million in cash and issued 404,698 shares of the Company's common stock upon the closing of the transaction on July 17, 2019. Additionally, the Company issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures in September 2019, of which a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay a $30.0 million senior term loan. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem existing subordinated debt that is redeemable in June 2020, and for general corporate purposes.\nOn August 6, 2019, the board of directors of the Company approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of its common stock. Stock repurchases under the program maybe be made from time to time on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in any manner that complies with applicable securities laws, at the discretion of the Company. The program will be in effect until June 30, 2020, with the timing of the purchases and the number of shares repurchased under the program dependent upon a variety of factors including price, trading volume, corporate and regulatory requirements and market condition. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. As of December 31, 2019, $4.0 million, or 156,749 shares of the Company's stock, had been repurchased under the program.\nLiquidity Management. Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders.\nIntegral to our liquidity management is the administration of short-term borrowings. To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we seek to meet our liquidity needs through wholesale funding or other borrowings, including our ability to borrow from the FHLB, on either a short- or long-term basis.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured borrowings, generally mature within one to four days from the transaction date. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. The Bank may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Investment securities with a carrying amount of $87.4 million and\n$132.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were pledged for securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $21.6 million and $56.8 million, respectively, available under lines of credit from the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The lines are collateralized by a collateral agreement with respect to a pool of commercial real estate loans totaling $24.3 million and $67.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had federal funds lines of credit available totaling $20.0 \u00admillion. These lines of credit were unused as of December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had capacity to borrow $481.0 million and $482.2 million, respectively, from the FHLB. The Company's advances from the FHLB are collateralized by a blanket collateral agreement of qualifying mortgage and home equity line of credit loans and certain commercial real estate loans totaling $1.94 billion and $2.22 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, must provide for its own liquidity. The Company's main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to us by the Bank. There are statutory, regulatory and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. Management believes that these limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action\u201d, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies.\nAs of January 1, 2019, in order to not be subject to required restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonus payments, banking organizations must maintain minimum ratios of (i) Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital) , (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital), (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital), and (iv) Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets of at least 4.0%.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company and the Bank exceeded the regulatory minimums (including capital conservation buffer), and the Bank met the regulatory definition of well-capitalized based on the most recent regulatory notification.\nThe following table presents the Company and the Bank's capital ratios and the minimum requirements at December 31,

obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. We expect to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. We have in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have limited off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold.\nWe enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding. We decrease our\nexposure to losses under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses.\nStandby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event that the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements.\nWe guarantee the distributions and payments for redemption or liquidation of the trust preferred securities issued by our wholly owned subsidiary business trusts to the extent of funds held by the trusts. Although this guarantee is not separately recorded, the obligation underlying the guarantee is fully reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as junior subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts. The junior subordinated debentures currently qualify as Tier 1 capital under the Federal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket Risk. Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from investments in securities backed by mortgage loans.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOverview. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (reprice risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers' ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors' ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR (basis risk).\nOur board of directors' Risk Policy and Compliance Committee establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk. The Risk Policy and Compliance Committee establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the board of directors' policies. In general, we seek to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities. Our Risk Policy and Compliance Committee meets quarterly to monitor the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the board of directors' approved risk limits.\nInterest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints.\nAn asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on our interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding our net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income, as rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on our interest-earning assets, thus compressing our net interest margin.\nIncome Simulation and Economic Value Analysis. Interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the Risk Policy and Compliance Committee at least quarterly. The information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk.\nWe use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net Interest Income at Risk ( NII at Risk\u201d) and Economic Value of Equity ( EVE\u201d). Under NII at Risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivatives. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE is a period end measurement.\nThe following table shows NII at Risk at the dates indicated:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Interest Income Sensitivity (Shocks)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Immediate Change in Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u221250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (10,540)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (8,497)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (3,065)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe report NII at Risk to isolate the change in income related solely to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The NII at Risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models \u2212100, \u221250, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months. Since short-term interest rates remained low through 2017, a NII at Risk analysis with an assumed decrease of 100 basis points did not provide meaningful results at December 31, 2017.\nWe are within Board policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios at December 31, 2019. The Company, at December 31, 2019 exceeded the established tolerance level for the -100 basis point sensitivity. Tolerance levels for risk management require the continuing development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within approved levels as we adjust the balance sheet. NII at Risk reported at December 31, 2019, projects that our earnings exhibit increased sensitivity at \u2212100 basis point scenario to changes in interest rates compared to December 31, 2018.\nThe following table shows EVE at the dates indicated:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity (Shocks)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Immediate Change in Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u221250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (91,101)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 49,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 73,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (80,035)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 40,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 69,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.7)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (20,384)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 53,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.6)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe EVE results included in the table above reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models immediate \u2212100, \u221250, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates.\nThe EVE reported at December 31, 2019 projects that as interest rates increase, the economic value of equity position will increase, and as interest rates decrease, the economic value of equity position will decrease. When interest rates rise, fixed rate assets generally lose economic value; the longer the duration, the greater the value lost. The opposite is true when interest rates fall.\nWe are within board policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios at December 31, 2019.\nIn September 2018, the Federal Reserve increased the range for the Federal Funds Target Rate, which led to an increase in the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to -100 basis points from the prior - 50 basis point floor. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a parallel 100 basis point increase or 100 basis point decrease in\ninterest rates over the twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than the tolerance level. The Company, at December 31, 2019, exceeded the established tolerance level for the -100 basis point sensitivity.\nPrice Risk. Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from equity investments and investments in mortgage-backed securities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances, results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAccounting policies, as described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates that are likely to occur from period to period, or using different estimates that we could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nLoans Held for Investment. Loans held for investment includes loans we originate and retain on the balance sheet and other loans acquired through acquisition. Our accounting policies require that we evaluate all acquired loans for evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination and to evaluate whether it is probable that we will collect all contractually required payments from the borrower. Loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality are accounted for as PCI loans. For PCI loans, the amount of contractually required payments receivable in excess of the amount of future cash flows we estimate at acquisition is considered a nonaccretable difference. The PCI loans are reflected on the balance sheet based on the amount expected to be collected. In addition, the amount of future cash flows expected to be collected in excess of the fair value of the PCI loans is considered accretable yield and is recognized in interest income on a level-yield basis over the estimated life of the acquired loans.\nWe reevaluate our original estimates of cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the PCI loans on a quarterly basis. If it is probable, based on current information and events, that there is a significant increase in cash flows than previously expected to be collected, or if actual cash flows are significantly greater than cash flows previously expected, we adjust the amount of accretable yield by reclassification from nonaccretable difference. Conversely, if we believe we will be unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition, we establish a valuation allowance through the allowance for loan losses with a change to the provision for loan losses.\nDetermining the accretable and nonaccretable amounts at acquisition and the ongoing reevaluation of expected cash flows are considered critical accounting estimates, as these require significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including our assessment of historical loss rates, changes in the nature of the portfolio and delinquency trends.\nInvestment Securities. Investment securities generally must be classified as equity, held to maturity, available for sale or trading. The Company classifies debt investment its securities as available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase. Investments in stock of a publicly traded company or in mutual funds are classified as equity securities. Held-to-maturity securities are principally debt securities that we have both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Trading securities are held primarily for sale in the near term to generate income. Securities that do not meet the definition of equity, trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.\nThe classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on these securities. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading securities flow directly\nthrough earnings during the periods in which they arise. Trading, equity and available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value each reporting period. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss) and do not affect earnings until realized or deemed to be OTTI. Investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost, unless deemed to be OTTI.\nThe fair values of investment securities are generally determined by various pricing models. We evaluate the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values. We perform a quarterly analysis on the pricing of investment securities to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. Our procedures include initial and ongoing review of pricing methodologies and trends. We seek to ensure prices represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of broker quotes, current sales transactions from our portfolio and pricing techniques, which are based on the net present value of future expected cash flows discounted at a rate of return market participants would require. Significant inputs used in internal pricing techniques are estimated by type of underlying collateral, estimated prepayment speeds where applicable and appropriate discount rates. As a result of this analysis, if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value, the price is adjusted accordingly.\nWhen the level and volume of trading activity for certain securities has significantly declined or when we believe that pricing is based in part on forced liquidation or distressed sales, we estimate fair value based on a combination of pricing information and an internal model using a discounted cash flow approach. We make certain significant assumptions in addition to those discussed above related to the liquidity risk premium, specific nonperformance and default experience in the collateral underlying the security. The values resulting from each approach are weighted to derive the final fair value for each security trading in an inactive market.\nThe fair value of investment securities is a critical accounting estimate. Changes in fair value estimates that occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that could have been reasonably used in the current period, could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in the held for investment loan portfolio. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature of the portfolio, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses and the impacts of local, regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels.\nFor PCI loans, an allowance may be required subsequent to their acquisition. The PCI loans are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, with the estimated fair value including a component for estimated credit losses. A portion of the allowance, however, may be set aside in the future if a PCI loan pool experiences a decrease in expected cash flows as compared to those projected at the acquisition date.\nDetermining the amount of the allowance is considered a critical accounting estimate, as it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including management's assessment of overall portfolio quality. The allowance is maintained at an amount we believe is sufficient to provide for estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and fluctuations in the provision for loan losses may result from management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our allowance, and therefore our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nLoan Servicing Rights. The Company sells residential mortgage loans, commercial FHA mortgage loans and SBA loans in the secondary market. Loan servicing rights resulting from us retaining the right to service the loans sold are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value. Loan servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its mortgage servicing rights asset for impairment. Impairment is assessed based on the fair value of net servicing cash flows at each reporting date using estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying loans serviced and stratifications based on the risk characteristics of the underlying loans. The fair value of our servicing rights is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated\nfuture net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, replacement reserves and other economic factors which are estimated based on current market conditions.\nDetermining the fair value of our loan servicing rights for impairment assessment purposes is considered a critical accounting estimate, as it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGoodwill. Our goodwill impairment test is performed as of September 30th each year and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are defined as the same level as, or one level below, an operating segment. An operating segment is a component of a business for which separate financial information is available that management regularly evaluates in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.\nIn 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine if our goodwill was impaired. The qualitative assessment involved the examination of changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors and other relevant entity-specific events, including changes in management and other key personnel and changes in the share price of the Company's common stock.\nDeferred Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Accounting for deferred income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. Management's determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, reversing temporary differences which may offset, and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. These judgments and estimates are inherently subjective and reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period, which would negatively affect earnings.", "item_7_truncated": "Allowance for PCI loans. PCI loans are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, with the estimated fair value including a component for estimated credit losses. An allowance related to PCI loans may be recorded subsequent to acquisition if a PCI loan pool experiences a decrease in expected cash flows as compared to the expected cash flows projected in the previous quarter. Loans considered to be uncollectible are initially charged off against the specific loan pool's non-accretable difference. When the pool's non-accretable difference has been fully utilized, uncollectible amounts are charged off against the corresponding allowance.

compared to 2018. The increase in volume was primarily due to $211.1 million of loans and $3.6 million of loans held for sale added from the acquisition of HomeStar, and $255.4 million of growth in our equipment financing loan portfolio from $376.1 million in 2018. The reported yield on total loans was 5.27% and 5.06% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in yield on loans was primarily driven by the impact of higher market interest rates and accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on loans acquired, which totaled $12.6 million and $13.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, increasing the reported yields by 22 and 24 basis points for each respective period.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Statement Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 249,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 223,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 153,113\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,451\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 189,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 180,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,662\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,556\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,362\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152,997\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,471\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,415\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,056\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income available to common shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 55,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 39,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 15,973\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0.89\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0.87\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetermining the amount of the allowance is considered a critical accounting estimate, as it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including management's assessment of overall portfolio quality.

The Company, at December 31, 2019 exceeded the established tolerance level for the -100 basis point sensitivity. Tolerance levels for risk management require the continuing development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within approved levels as we adjust the balance sheet. NII at Risk reported at December 31, 2019, projects that our earnings exhibit increased sensitivity at \u2212100 basis point scenario to changes in interest rates compared to December 31, 2018.\nDetermining the accretable and nonaccretable amounts at acquisition and the ongoing reevaluation of expected cash flows are considered critical accounting estimates, as these require significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including our assessment of historical loss rates, changes in the nature of the portfolio and delinquency trends.\nAs described above, one of the factors that impacts net interest income is interest rate fluctuations. The Federal Reserve implemented quarterly interest rate increases in 2018, with the last increase of 25 basis points in December 2018. These increases impact the comparability of net interest income between 2018 and 2019 because the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates by 75 basis points in the second half of 2019.\nOther noninterest expense. The $2.5 million increase in other noninterest expense was primarily due to $3.2 million of asset impairment in 2019 on one banking facility that was closed in 2019 and two additional banking facilities that were closed in the first quarter of 2020 related to our branch network consolidation plan. Additionally, in 2019, we recognized a $1.8 million loss on the repurchase of subordinated debt. These increases were partially offset by costs associated with supplies, insurance, travel, meals, postage and training incurred in 2018 related to the acquisitions of Centrue and Alpine.\nTable 82:

Standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Interest Income Sensitivity (Shocks)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Immediate Change in Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u221250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (10,540)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (8,497)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (3,065)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe utilize an asset risk classification system in compliance with guidelines established by the Federal Reserve as part of our efforts to improve asset quality. In connection with examinations of insured institutions, examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard,\u201d doubtful,\u201d and loss.\u201d Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable and there is a high probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. An asset classified as loss is not considered collectable and is of such little value that continuance of booking the asset is not warranted.\n\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

summarizes our average deposit balances and weighted average rates for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nResidential mortgage banking revenue. The decrease of $2.8 million in residential mortgage banking revenue reflected declines in closed production and interest rate lock commitments that were due in part to a smaller loan production team. In addition, servicing fees decreased as a result of the sale and transfer of mortgage servicing rights in 2018 and 2019. In late 2017, the Company had committed to a plan to sell mortgage servicing rights, resulting in the transfer of serviced residential mortgage loans for others to residential mortgage servicing rights held for sale.\nIncreases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period's average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the previous period's volume. Changes which are not due solely to volume or rate have been allocated proportionally to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\nSubsequent to an acquisition, we periodically evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent changes in the estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassifications between accretable yield and the nonaccretable difference. Decreases in expected cash flows due to further credit deterioration will result in an impairment charge to the provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses and a reclassification from accretable yield to nonaccretable difference. Increases in expected cash flows due to credit improvements will result in an increase in the accretable yield through a reclassification from the nonaccretable difference or as a reduction in the allowance for loan losses to the extent established on specific pools subsequent to acquisition. The adjusted accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

above, we recorded PCI loans at estimated fair value on their acquisition date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. As a result of adding $211.1 million of loans from the acquisition of HomeStar, $786.2 million of loans from the acquisition of Alpine and $679.6 million of loans from the acquisition of Centrue, combined with net loan charge-offs of $9.9 million, $5.0 million and $8.0 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased to 0.64% at December 31, 2019 from 0.51% and 0.51% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Although the recent acquisitions have generally kept the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans ratio low, the additional specific reserves recorded in 2019 offset the benefit from the acquisition of HomeStar, causing the increase in the allowance for loan losses.\nInvestment Securities.

We adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019, which required the recognition of operating lease right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) assets. Operating lease ROU assets represent the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, specified assets for the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets totaled $14.2 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe principal categories of our loan portfolio are discussed below:\nItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $21.6 million and $56.8 million, respectively, available under lines of credit from the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The lines are collateralized by a collateral agreement with respect to a pool of commercial real estate loans totaling $24.3 million and $67.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCredit Reserves. One of our key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintenance of an appropriate level of reserve protection against probable losses in our loan portfolio. In 2019, our provision for loan losses was $17.0 million compared to $9.4 million in 2018 and $9.6 million in 2017.\nIndividual loans considered to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance. Factors used in determining the amount and timing of charge-offs on loans include consideration of the loan type, length of delinquency, sufficiency of collateral value, lien priority and the overall financial condition of the borrower. Collateral value is determined using updated appraisals and/or other market comparable information. Charge-offs are generally taken on loans once the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance. Net charge-offs to average loans were 0.23% and 0.13% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWealth management revenue. Noninterest income from our wealth management business increased $1.3 million primarily due to an increase in trust and estate fees, the addition of $181.2 million of assets under administration added from the acquisition of HomeStar, and a full year's effect of the addition of $1.0 billion of wealth management assets under administration from the acquisition of Alpine in February 2018.\n (3) Net interest margin during the periods presented represents: (i) the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and the interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, divided by (ii) average interest-earning assets for the period. \nThe following table shows EVE at the dates indicated:\nThe following table presents the recorded investment of potential problem commercial loans (excluding PCI loans) by loan category at the dates indicated:\nThe following table sets forth the book value, maturities and weighted average yields for our investment portfolio at December 31, 2019. The book value for investment securities classified as available for sale is equal to fair market value.\nThe following table presents average balance sheet information, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and nonperforming balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments.\nMaterial Trends and Developments\nIn 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine if our goodwill was impaired. The qualitative assessment involved the examination of changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors and other relevant entity-specific events, including changes in management and other key personnel and changes in the share price of the Company's common stock.\nLiabilities. Total liabilities increased to $5.43 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $5.03 billion at December 31, 2018. This increase primarily reflected the addition of $362.9 million of liabilities from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of HomeStar, the Company paid $1.0 million in cash and issued 404,698 shares of the Company's common stock upon the closing of the transaction on July 17, 2019. Additionally, the Company issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures in September 2019, of which a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay a $30.0 million senior term loan. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem existing subordinated debt that is redeemable in June 2020, and for general corporate purposes.\nWe have also recorded accretable discounts in purchase accounting for loans that are not considered PCI loans. Similar to the way in which we employ the fair value methodology for PCI loans, we consider expected prepayments and estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted cash flows in order to determine the accretable discount for non-PCI loans.\n\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018\n\nCommercial loans. We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial loans. The loans are typically made to small- and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital needs, business expansions and farm operations. Commercial loans generally include lines of credit and loans with maturities of five years or less. The loans are generally made with business operations as the primary source of repayment, but may also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable and equipment, and generally include personal guarantees.\nOverview. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (reprice risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers' ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors' ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR (basis risk).\nWe use what we believe is a comprehensive methodology to monitor credit quality and prudently manage credit concentration within our loan portfolio. Our underwriting policies and practices govern the risk profile and credit and geographic concentration for our loan portfolio. We also have what we believe to be a comprehensive methodology to monitor these credit quality standards, including a risk classification system that identifies potential problem loans based on risk characteristics by loan type as well as the early identification of deterioration at the individual loan level. In addition to our allowance for loan losses, our purchase discounts on acquired loans provide additional protections against credit losses.\nInterchange revenue. Noninterest income from interchange revenue increased $1.3 million due primarily to an increased level of debit card activity primarily as a result of the acquisition of HomeStar and a full year of debit card activity related to accounts acquired from Alpine.\n (1) Weighted average yield for tax-exempt securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. \n\nAverage Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis\nThe following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses, provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the years indicated:\nfuture net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, replacement reserves and other economic factors which are estimated based on current market conditions.\nIn September 2018, the Federal Reserve increased the range for the Federal Funds Target Rate, which led to an increase in the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to -100 basis points from the prior - 50 basis point floor. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a parallel 100 basis point increase or 100 basis point decrease in\nOur principal lines of business include traditional community banking, wealth management, and commercial FHA origination and servicing. Our traditional community banking business primarily consists of commercial and retail lending and deposit taking with a total loan portfolio of $4.40 billion and total deposits of $4.54 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our wealth management group provides a comprehensive suite of trust and wealth management products and services, and has grown to $3.41 billion of assets under administration as of December 31, 2019. Our commercial FHA business, which originates commercial mortgage loans for multifamily and healthcare facilities under FHA insurance programs, had $347.4 million of originations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe are within board policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios at December 31, 2019.\nAccounting policies, as described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates that are likely to occur from period to period, or using different estimates that we could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe allowance and the balance of nonaccretable discounts represent our estimate of probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in loans held for investment as of the respective balance sheet date. We assess the appropriateness of our allowance for non-PCI loans separately from our allowance for PCI loans.\n (1) Interest income and average rates for tax-exempt loans and securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018 and 35% for 2017. Tax-equivalent adjustments totaled $2.0 million, $2.1 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nNoninterest Income. The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nincluding deductions for purchase discounts. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming status because we expect to fully collect their new carrying values, which reflect significant purchase discounts. If our expectation of reasonably estimable future cash flows from PCI loans deteriorates, the loans may be classified as nonaccrual loans, and interest income will not be recognized until the timing and amount of future cash flows can be reasonably estimated.\nMortgage Servicing Rights. The Company sells residential and commercial FHA mortgage loans in the secondary market. Mortgage servicing rights ( MSR\u201d) resulting from us retaining the right to service the loans sold are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value. MSR are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assessed for impairment at each reporting date.\nThe following table shows the composition of PCI loans within our portfolio at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTotal loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased $256.7 million to $4.37 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to $211.1 million of loans added from the acquisition of HomeStar. Also contributing to the growth was organic loan growth primarily from our equipment financing business, which is booked in the commercial loans and lease financing portfolios. These increases were partially offset by several large loan payoffs and principal reductions in the commercial real estate portfolio during 2019. The $0.3 million decrease in PCI loans at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 reflected loan payoffs and repayments made throughout the year, partially offset by the addition of $17.6 million of PCI loans from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured borrowings, generally mature within one to four days from the transaction date. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. The Bank may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Investment securities with a carrying amount of $87.4 million and\nWe believe that we will be able to meet our contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. We expect to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. We have in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nOur board of directors' Risk Policy and Compliance Committee establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk. The Risk Policy and Compliance Committee establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the board of directors' policies. In general, we seek to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities. Our Risk Policy and Compliance Committee meets quarterly to monitor the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the board of directors' approved risk limits.\nNoninterest Expense. The following table sets forth the major components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nEconomic and Interest Rate Environment. The results of our operations are highly dependent on economic conditions and market interest rates. Over the past several years, economic conditions in the U.S. and our primary market areas have improved. Economic growth has been modest, the real estate market continues to improve and unemployment rates in the U.S. and our primary markets have remained low.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses, or the allowance, by loan category:\nimpairment charge of $2.1 million in 2019 as compared to a $0.5 million recovery of previous impairment charges in 2018.\nInvestment Securities. Investment securities generally must be classified as equity, held to maturity, available for sale or trading. The Company classifies debt investment its securities as available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase. Investments in stock of a publicly traded company or in mutual funds are classified as equity securities. Held-to-maturity securities are principally debt securities that we have both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Trading securities are held primarily for sale in the near term to generate income. Securities that do not meet the definition of equity, trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.\nInterest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints.\n\nThe following table shows changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nEach factor listed below materially affects the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition in 2019, 2018 and 2017, and may affect the comparability of financial information we report in future fiscal periods.\nRegulatory Environment. As a result of regulatory changes, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Rule, we expect to be subject to more restrictive capital requirements, more stringent asset concentration and growth limitations and new and potentially heightened examination and reporting requirements. We also expect to face a more challenging environment for customer loan demand due to the increased costs that could be ultimately borne by borrowers, and to incur higher costs to comply with these new regulations. This uncertain regulatory environment could have a detrimental impact on our ability to manage our business consistent with historical practices and cause difficulty in executing our growth plan. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Business Environment and Our Industry\u201d and Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nShareholders' equity increased $53.4 million to $661.9 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity was due primarily to the generation of net income of $55.8 million, $10.3 million of common equity issued for the acquisition of HomeStar, and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $9.6 million, partially offset by $23.6 million of declared dividends to common shareholders and $2.6 million of Series H preferred stock redemptions.\nIn determining the fair value of PCI loans at acquisition, we first determine the contractually required payments due, which represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payments, adjusted for the effect of estimated prepayments. We then estimate the undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect. We incorporate several key assumptions to estimate cash flows expected to be collected, including probability of default rates, loss given default assumptions and the amount and timing of prepayments. We calculate fair value by discounting the estimated cash flows we expect to collect using an observable market rate of interest, when available, adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value. We have aggregated certain credit-impaired loans acquired in the same transaction into pools based on common risk characteristics. A pool is accounted for as one asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate fair value and expected cash flows.\nInterest expense on deposits increased to $34.2 million from $22.1 million in 2018. The $12.1 million increase was primarily due to an increase of $10.3 million and $1.8 million in rate and volume of deposits, respectively. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to higher interest rates paid on deposits due to the impact of higher market interest rates. The increase in volume was primarily attributable to the addition of $321.7 million of deposits added from the acquisition of HomeStar, and an increase in our average balances of $227.9 million from our new Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d) product offering. With the increase in deposits from the acquisition of HomeStar and organically, we have been able to replace, in part, wholesale funds through the intentional decrease in brokered time deposits which results in lower average rate paid on deposits.\nCommercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans consist of both real estate occupied by the borrower for ongoing operations and non-owner occupied real estate properties. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a wide variety of property types, such as owner occupied offices, warehouses and production facilities, office buildings, hotels, mixed-use residential and commercial facilities, retail centers, multifamily properties and assisted living facilities. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio also includes farmland loans. Farmland loans are generally made to a borrower actively involved in farming rather than to passive investors.\nFor PCI loans, an allowance may be required subsequent to their acquisition. The PCI loans are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, with the estimated fair value including a component for estimated credit losses. A portion of the allowance, however, may be set aside in the future if a PCI loan pool experiences a decrease in expected cash flows as compared to those projected at the acquisition date.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses totaled $17.0 million in 2019 compared to $9.4 million in 2018. The increase in provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to an increase in charge-offs and an increase specific reserves established on nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio during 2019, coupled with growth of our loan portfolio and the resultant increase in required reserves.\nWe reevaluate our original estimates of cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the PCI loans on a quarterly basis. If it is probable, based on current information and events, that there is a significant increase in cash flows than previously expected to be collected, or if actual cash flows are significantly greater than cash flows previously expected, we adjust the amount of accretable yield by reclassification from nonaccretable difference. Conversely, if we believe we will be unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition, we establish a valuation allowance through the allowance for loan losses with a change to the provision for loan losses.\nThe fair value of investment securities is a critical accounting estimate. Changes in fair value estimates that occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that could have been reasonably used in the current period, could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nexposure to losses under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses.\nOn June 9, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Centrue and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Centrue Bank, which operated 20 full-service banking centers located principally in northern Illinois. The Company acquired $990.2 million in assets, including $679.6 million in loans, and assumed $739.9 million in deposits.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances, results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe use a ten grade risk rating system to categorize and determine the credit risk of our loans. Potential problem loans include loans with a risk grade of 7, which are \"special mention,\" and loans with a risk grade of 8, which are \"substandard\" loans that are not considered to be impaired. These loans generally require more frequent loan officer contact and receipt of financial data to closely monitor borrower performance. Potential problem loans are managed and monitored regularly through a number of processes, procedures and committees, including oversight by a loan administration committee comprised of executive officers and other members of the Bank's senior management team.\nLiquidity Management. Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders.\nLoans. The loan portfolio is the largest category of our assets. The following table presents the balance and associated percentage of each major category in our loan portfolio at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nFor discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017, refer to Item 7 of the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had capacity to borrow $481.0 million and $482.2 million, respectively, from the FHLB. The Company's advances from the FHLB are collateralized by a blanket collateral agreement of qualifying mortgage and home equity line of credit loans and certain commercial real estate loans totaling $1.94 billion and $2.22 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, must provide for its own liquidity. The Company's main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to us by the Bank. There are statutory, regulatory and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. Management believes that these limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations.\nThe following table shows NII at Risk at the dates indicated:\nWe continue to believe we have significant opportunities for further growth through additional acquisitions of banks, branches, wealth management firms and trust departments of community banks, selective de novo opportunities, continued expansion of our wealth management operations, the hiring of commercial banking and wealth management professionals from other organizations and organic growth within our existing branch network. We also believe we have the necessary experience, management and infrastructure to take advantage of these growth opportunities.\nInterest Rates and Operating Interest Differential\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company transferred the remaining $3.6 million of residential MSR to MSR held for sale. A gain of $0.5 million was recognized on MSR held for sale during 2019 and a loss of $0.5 million was recognized on MSR held for sale in 2018. In 2017, we recognized $0.8 million of impairment charges on our residential mortgage servicing rights. In 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $2.1 million on our commercial FHA mortgage servicing rights compared to $0.5 million in recoveries of previously recorded impairment charges in 2018 and impairment charges of $1.5 million in 2017.\nLoans Held for Investment. Loans held for investment includes loans we originate and retain on the balance sheet and other loans acquired through acquisition. Our accounting policies require that we evaluate all acquired loans for evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination and to evaluate whether it is probable that we will collect all contractually required payments from the borrower. Loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality are accounted for as PCI loans. For PCI loans, the amount of contractually required payments receivable in excess of the amount of future cash flows we estimate at acquisition is considered a nonaccretable difference. The PCI loans are reflected on the balance sheet based on the amount expected to be collected. In addition, the amount of future cash flows expected to be collected in excess of the fair value of the PCI loans is considered accretable yield and is recognized in interest income on a level-yield basis over the estimated life of the acquired loans.\nAllowance for non-PCI loans. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for non-PCI loans includes a general allowance for performing loans, which are grouped based on similar characteristics, and a specific allowance for individual impaired loans or loans considered by management to be in a high risk category. General allowances are established based on a number of factors, including historical loss rates, an assessment of portfolio trends and conditions, accrual status and economic conditions.\nOther noninterest income. The increase of $1.0 million in other noninterest income reflected an increase in bridge loan fees from Love Funding as well as servicing fees and gain on sale of SBA loans acquired from HomeStar. The increase was partially offset by a gain on proceeds from our bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) program in 2018 that did not recur in 2019.\n\nMidland States Bancorp, Inc. is a diversified financial holding company headquartered in Effingham, Illinois. Its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Midland States Bank, has branches across Illinois and in Missouri, and provides a full range of commercial and consumer banking products and services, business equipment financing, merchant credit card services, trust and investment management, and insurance and financial planning services. In addition, multifamily and healthcare facility FHA financing is provided through Love Funding, our non-bank subsidiary. As of December 31, 2019, we had $6.09 billion in assets, $4.54 billion of deposits and $661.9 million of shareholders' equity.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Management\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company periodically evaluates its mortgage servicing rights asset for impairment. Impairment is assessed based on the fair value of net servicing cash flows at each reporting date using estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying loans serviced and stratifications based on the risk characteristics of the underlying loans. The fair value of our servicing rights is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated\nThe difference between contractually required payments due and the cash flows expected to be collected, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference, which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, reflects estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, but is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loans, or pool of loans, using the effective yield method. The outstanding customer balance for PCI loans totaled $51.9 million and $56.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWhen the level and volume of trading activity for certain securities has significantly declined or when we believe that pricing is based in part on forced liquidation or distressed sales, we estimate fair value based on a combination of pricing information and an internal model using a discounted cash flow approach. We make certain significant assumptions in addition to those discussed above related to the liquidity risk premium, specific nonperformance and default experience in the collateral underlying the security. The values resulting from each approach are weighted to derive the final fair value for each security trading in an inactive market.\nAs of January 1, 2019, in order to not be subject to required restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonus payments, banking organizations must maintain minimum ratios of (i) Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital) , (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital), (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital), and (iv) Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets of at least 4.0%.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company and the Bank exceeded the regulatory minimums (including capital conservation buffer), and the Bank met the regulatory definition of well-capitalized based on the most recent regulatory notification.\nSalaries and employee benefits. The $5.5 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily driven by change in control payments, severance costs and other benefit-related expenses in 2018 related to the acquisition of Alpine. The decrease in expense was offset by an increase in severance and change in control costs associated with the acquisition of HomeStar in 2019.\nOn August 6, 2019, the board of directors of the Company approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of its common stock. Stock repurchases under the program maybe be made from time to time on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in any manner that complies with applicable securities laws, at the discretion of the Company. The program will be in effect until June 30, 2020, with the timing of the purchases and the number of shares repurchased under the program dependent upon a variety of factors including price, trading volume, corporate and regulatory requirements and market condition. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. As of December 31, 2019, $4.0 million, or 156,749 shares of the Company's stock, had been repurchased under the program.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses. In determining the allowance and the related provision for loan losses, we consider three principal elements: (i) valuation allowances based upon probable losses identified during the review of impaired commercial, commercial real estate, and construction and land development loans, (ii) allocations, by loan classes, on loan portfolios based on historical loan loss experience and qualitative factors, and (iii) valuation allowances on PCI loan pools based on decreases in expected cash flows. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to adjust the total allowance to a level deemed appropriate by us.\n\nFHLB Advances and Other Borrowings. FHLB advances and other borrowings totaled $493.3 million and $640.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease of $147.3 million was primarily due to $482.2 million and $32.9 million of payments made on FHLB borrowings and other borrowings, respectively, partially offset by $360.0 million of additional FHLB borrowings during 2019.\nShort-Term Borrowings. In addition to deposits, we use short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, as a source of funds to meet the daily liquidity needs of\nThe table below presents the credit ratings for our investment securities classified as available for sale, at fair value, at December 31, 2019:\nour customers and fund growth in earning assets. Short-term borrowings were $82.0 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $124.2 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by customers migrating to a new deposit product. The weighted average interest rate on our short-term borrowings was 0.67% and 0.71% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nBranch Optimization Plan. In the first quarter of 2017, we closed seven banking offices as a result of the branch network optimization plan that we announced in November 2016. In 2017, the Company announced the closure of six additional banking facilities as a result of the acquisition of Centrue. Consequently, we recorded $2.0 million of asset impairment in 2017 on these banking facilities. There was no impairment recorded in 2018. We had $1.7 million and $3.4 million of branch-related assets classified in other assets as held for sale at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the balance of accretable discounts on our PCI loan portfolio was $12.1 million compared to $12.2 million at December 31, 2018. We may not accrete the full amount of these discounts into interest income in future periods if the assets to which these discounts are applied do not perform according to our current expectations.\nPurchased Loans. Our net interest margin benefits from favorable changes in expected cash flows on our PCI loans and from accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on the non-purchased credit impaired loans ( Non-PCI loans\u201d) included in our acquisitions. Our reported net interest margins were 3.69%, 3.76% and 3.77% for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on loans acquired totaled $12.6 million, $13.4 million and $9.7 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing the reported margins by 22, 24 and 25 basis points for each respective period.\n\nRecent Acquisitions. On July 17, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of HomeStar and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, HomeStar Bank, which operated five full-service banking centers in northern Illinois. The Company acquired $367.2 million in assets, including $211.1 million in loans, and assumed $321.7 million in deposits.\n (1) Represents the percentage of the allowance to total loans in the respective category. \nthrough earnings during the periods in which they arise. Trading, equity and available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value each reporting period. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss) and do not affect earnings until realized or deemed to be OTTI. Investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost, unless deemed to be OTTI.\ninterest rates over the twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than the tolerance level. The Company, at December 31, 2019, exceeded the established tolerance level for the -100 basis point sensitivity.\nCapital Resources. Shareholders' equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, sales and redemptions of common stock and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities.\nWe report NII at Risk to isolate the change in income related solely to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The NII at Risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models \u2212100, \u221250, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months. Since short-term interest rates remained low through 2017, a NII at Risk analysis with an assumed decrease of 100 basis points did not provide meaningful results at December 31, 2017.\nOutstanding loan balances increased due to new loan originations, advances on outstanding commitments and loans acquired as a result of acquisitions of other financial institutions, net of amounts received for loan payments and payoffs, charge-offs of loans and transfers of loans to other real estate owned. The following table shows the fair values of the loans acquired during the years presented and the net growth or attrition of the acquired loans during the periods presented:\nIn May 2017, we entered into a loan agreement with another bank for a revolving line of credit in the original principal amount of up to $10.0 million and a term loan in the original principal amount of $40.0 million. In September 2019, the Company paid off the term loan from the proceeds received from the issuance of subordinated debt discussed above and terminated the revolving line of credit.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in the held for investment loan portfolio. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature of the portfolio, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses and the impacts of local, regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest-earning assets (primarily loans and securities) and interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings), is our primary source of revenue, comprising of 71.6% of 2019 revenues. Net interest income is impacted by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders' equity, also support earning assets. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets and is presented on a tax-equivalent basis to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield on a taxable asset. We used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% for 2019 and 2018.\nThe classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on these securities. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading securities flow directly\nResults of Operations\nFor commercial, commercial real estate and construction and land development loans, a specific allowance may be assigned to individual loans based on an impairment analysis. Loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The amount of impairment is based on an analysis of the most probable source of repayment, including the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows and the estimated market value or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Interest income on impaired loans is accrued as earned, unless the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we committed to a plan to sell our Fannie Mae residential mortgage servicing rights and transferred $14.2 million of residential MSR, net of valuation allowances, to MSR held for sale. As a result, we recognized a $4.1 million loss in 2017 on MSR held for sale to reflect the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. After recognizing this loss, MSR held for sale had a net carrying value of $10.2 million at December 31, 2017. We sold our Fannie Mae residential mortgage servicing rights on January 2, 2018.\nPrimary Factors Affecting Comparability\nCommercial FHA revenue. The increase of $2.2 million in commercial FHA revenue was primarily driven by an increase in gain premiums, partially offset by lower loan costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest rate lock commitments increased to $307.9 million in 2019 from $236.6 million in 2018. Additionally, originations increased to $347.4 million in 2019 from $314.7 million in 2018. These increases were partially offset by an\nCommunity Banking. We believe the most important trends affecting community banks in the United States over the foreseeable future will be related to heightened regulatory capital requirements, increasing regulatory burdens generally, including the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations to be promulgated thereunder, and interest margin compression. We expect that community banks will face increased competition for lower cost capital as a result of regulatory policies that may offer larger financial institutions greater access to government assistance than is available for smaller institutions, including community banks. We expect that troubled community banks will continue to face significant challenges when attempting to raise capital. We also believe that heightened regulatory capital requirements will make it more difficult for even well-capitalized, healthy community banks to grow in their communities by taking advantage of opportunities in their markets that result as the economy continues to improve. We believe these trends will favor community banks that have sufficient capital, a diversified business model and a strong deposit franchise, and we believe we possess these characteristics.\nLoan Quality\nIn October 2017, we issued subordinated notes totaling $40.0 million, maturing on October 15, 2027, with a fixed rate of interest of 6.25% for the first five years and a floating rate of interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 422.9 basis points thereafter.\nWe guarantee the distributions and payments for redemption or liquidation of the trust preferred securities issued by our wholly owned subsidiary business trusts to the extent of funds held by the trusts. Although this guarantee is not separately recorded, the obligation underlying the guarantee is fully reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as junior subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts. The junior subordinated debentures currently qualify as Tier 1 capital under the Federal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $16.7 million in 2019 compared to $11.4 million in 2018. Effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 were 23.0% and 22.4%, respectively. The increase of the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the BOLI death benefit recorded in 2018.\nFinancial Condition\nOur other intangible assets, which consist of core deposit and trust relationship intangibles, were $34.9 million and $37.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in other intangibles was due to amortization expense of $7.1 million, partially offset by the $4.6 million in acquired intangibles from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nCapital Raising Transactions. On September 20, 2019, we issued, through a private placement, $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes, which was structured into two tranches: (1) $72.75 million, maturing on September 30, 2029 with a redemption option on or after September 30, 2024, with a fixed rate of interest of 5.00% for the first five years and a floating rate of interest equivalent to three-month SOFR plus 361.0 basis points thereafter,\nThe EVE reported at December 31, 2019 projects that as interest rates increase, the economic value of equity position will increase, and as interest rates decrease, the economic value of equity position will decrease. When interest rates rise, fixed rate assets generally lose economic value; the longer the duration, the greater the value lost. The opposite is true when interest rates fall.\n (2) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. Interest income on loans includes amortization of deferred loan fees, net of deferred loan costs. \nImpaired Loans. The following table sets forth our nonperforming assets by asset categories as of the dates indicated. Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and loans modified under troubled debt restructurings. The balances of impaired loans reflect the net investment in these assets,\n\nInterest expense on subordinated debt increased $1.3 million to $7.4 million due primarily to the issuance of $100.0 million of subordinated debt in September 2019. The increase was partially offset by the redemption of $16.5 million of subordinated debt during the fourth quarter of 2019. In turn, the reported yield decreased 24 basis points to 6.20% in 2019.\nIn 2019, the Company closed one facility and consolidated two additional facilities as a result of the acquisition of HomeStar. In addition, the Company planned to consolidate three other existing facilities in other areas of its footprint, one of which closed in 2019 and the remaining two facilities closed in January 2020. Consequently, in 2019, the Company recorded $3.2 million of asset impairment on banking facilities to be closed. We had $4.0 million of branch-related assets classified as held for sale in other assets at December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had federal funds lines of credit available totaling $20.0 \u00admillion. These lines of credit were unused as of December 31, 2019.\nGoodwill. Our goodwill impairment test is performed as of September 30th each year and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are defined as the same level as, or one level below, an operating segment. An operating segment is a component of a business for which separate financial information is available that management regularly evaluates in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.\nOur principal business activity has been lending to and accepting deposits from individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities. We have derived income principally from interest charged on loans and leases and, to a lesser extent, from interest and dividends earned on investment securities. We have also derived income from noninterest sources, such as: fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services; wealth management services; commercial FHA mortgage loan originations, sales and servicing; residential mortgage loan originations and sales; and, from time to time, gains on sales of assets. Our principal expenses include interest expense on deposits and borrowings, operating expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, data processing costs, professional fees and other noninterest expenses, provisions for loan losses and income tax expense.\nFDIC insurance. The $1.4 million decrease in FDIC insurance was primarily due to small business tax credits received from the FDIC. The credit was awarded by the FDIC to banks with total consolidated assets less than $10.0 billion for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the FDIC's reserve ratio. The Company has recognized $0.9 million in credits and expects to recognize additional credits of $0.6 million in future periods.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill was $171.8 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $164.7 million at December 31, 2018. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid in an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The $7.1 million increase in 2019 resulted from goodwill associated with the acquisition of HomeStar.\nLoan Servicing Rights. The Company sells residential mortgage loans, commercial FHA mortgage loans and SBA loans in the secondary market. Loan servicing rights resulting from us retaining the right to service the loans sold are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value. Loan servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income.\nCapital Raising Initiatives. One component of our initiative-driven strategic plan is to pursue accretive acquisitions. We have been able to implement our acquisition strategy due to several significant capital raising transactions. These transactions are described above in the section under Primary Factors Affecting Comparability-Capital Raising Transactions.\u201d These capital raising transactions have also supported our organic growth strategies.\n (1) As a result of accounting guidance adopted by the Company in the first quarter of 2018, equity securities were no longer presented within available for sale securities after such adoption. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previous GAAP. \nThe following table sets forth the book value and percentage of each category of investment securities at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The book value for investment securities classified as available for sale is equal to fair market value.\n (1) Total capital (to risk-weighted assets), Common Equity Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) and Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) includes the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. \nOperating Lease Liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019 also required the recognition of operating lease liabilities. Operating lease liabilities represent a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis. Operating lease liabilities totaled $15.4 million at December 31, 2019.\n\nIncome Simulation and Economic Value Analysis. Interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the Risk Policy and Compliance Committee at least quarterly. The information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk.\nThe following table sets forth the maturity of time deposits of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019:\nStandby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event that the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements.\nThe EVE results included in the table above reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models immediate \u2212100, \u221250, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates.\nHomeStar, as well as increased usage of FHLB advances as a funding source and the issuance of subordinated debt in September 2019.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Selected Financial Data,\u201d our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those set forth under Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\u201d Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. Readers of our Annual Report on Form 10-K should therefore consider these risks and uncertainties in evaluating forward-looking statements and should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nOverview. In 2019, we generated net income of $55.8 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $2.26, compared to $39.4 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $1.66, in 2018 and $16.1 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $0.87, in 2017. The 2019 earnings included a $9.7 million increase in net interest income, a $3.5 million increase in noninterest income and a $16.0 million decrease in noninterest expense. These results were partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in the provision for loan losses and a $5.3 million increase in income tax expense. The successful conversion and integration of our acquisition of HomeStar, our strong business development highlighted by growth in both loans and deposits and our focus on developing new depository products for commercial customers had a positive impact on our core deposit gathering, resulting in a steady improvement in our deposit mix, and all contributed to positive 2019 performance when compared to 2018.\nOverview\nWe use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net Interest Income at Risk ( NII at Risk\u201d) and Economic Value of Equity ( EVE\u201d). Under NII at Risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivatives. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE is a period end measurement.\nMarket Risk. Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from investments in securities backed by mortgage loans.\nProfessional fees. The $4.0 million decrease in professional fees was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees incurred on various technology and other integration related projects in 2018 associated primarily with the acquisition of Alpine.\nDeferred Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Accounting for deferred income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. Management's determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, reversing temporary differences which may offset, and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. These judgments and estimates are inherently subjective and reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period, which would negatively affect earnings.\n\nWe also believe that increased regulatory burdens will have a significant adverse effect on smaller community banks, which often lack the personnel, experience and technology to efficiently comply with new regulations in a variety of areas in the banking industry, including in the areas of deposits, lending, compensation, information security and overdraft protection. We believe the increased costs to smaller community banks from a more complex regulatory environment, coupled with challenges in the real estate lending area, present attractive acquisition opportunities for larger community banks that have already made significant investments in regulatory compliance and risk management and can acquire and quickly integrate these smaller institutions into their existing platform. Furthermore, we believe that, as a result of our significant operational investments and our experience acquiring other institutions and quickly integrating them into our organization, we are well positioned to capitalize on the challenges facing smaller community banks.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $28.0 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $20.9 million at December 31, 2018. The $7.1 million increase in the allowance was mainly attributable to a $4.7 million increase in specific reserves related primarily to commercial loans that were classified as nonaccrual during 2019.\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement information of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nIntegral to our liquidity management is the administration of short-term borrowings. To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we seek to meet our liquidity needs through wholesale funding or other borrowings, including our ability to borrow from the FHLB, on either a short- or long-term basis.\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe fair values of investment securities are generally determined by various pricing models. We evaluate the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values. We perform a quarterly analysis on the pricing of investment securities to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. Our procedures include initial and ongoing review of pricing methodologies and trends. We seek to ensure prices represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of broker quotes, current sales transactions from our portfolio and pricing techniques, which are based on the net present value of future expected cash flows discounted at a rate of return market participants would require. Significant inputs used in internal pricing techniques are estimated by type of underlying collateral, estimated prepayment speeds where applicable and appropriate discount rates. As a result of this analysis, if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value, the price is adjusted accordingly.\nWe did not recognize any interest income on nonaccrual loans during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 while they were in nonaccrual status. Additional interest income that we would have recognized on these loans had they been current in accordance with their original terms was $2.2 million, $1.8 million and $0.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We recognized interest income on commercial and commercial real estate loans modified under troubled debt restructurings of $0.1 million during each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe following table shows the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio and the distribution between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans at December 31, 2019:\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action\u201d, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies.\n\nPrice Risk. Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from equity investments and investments in mortgage-backed securities.", "item_7_text": "Allowance for PCI loans. PCI loans are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, with the estimated fair value including a component for estimated credit losses. An allowance related to PCI loans may be recorded subsequent to acquisition if a PCI loan pool experiences a decrease in expected cash flows as compared to the expected cash flows projected in the previous quarter. Loans considered to be uncollectible are initially charged off against the specific loan pool's non-accretable difference. When the pool's non-accretable difference has been fully utilized, uncollectible amounts are charged off against the corresponding allowance. The following table shows our allowance by loan portfolio and by non-PCI and PCI loans as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nConsumer loans. Our consumer loans include direct personal loans, indirect automobile loans, lines of credit and installment loans originated through home improvement specialty retailers and contractors. Personal loans are generally secured by automobiles, boats and other types of personal property and are made on an installment basis.\nWe enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding. We decrease our\nThe following table presents the Company and the Bank's capital ratios and the minimum requirements at December 31, 2019:\n\nCommunication fees. The $1.4 million decrease in communication fees was primarily due to integration and acquisition expenses in 2018 associated with the acquisition of Alpine.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\nPreferred Stock Repurchase. On July 29, 2019, we redeemed, in whole, the shares of the Company's Series H preferred stock. The price paid by the Company for such shares was equal to $1,000 per share plus any unpaid dividends.\n\nAssets. Total assets increased $449.3 million to $6.09 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. This increase primarily reflected the addition of $367.2 million of assets from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nDeposits. We emphasize developing total client relationships with our customers in order to increase our retail and commercial core deposit bases, which are our primary funding sources. Our deposits consist of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings and time deposit accounts.\nNet interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $191.9 million in 2019, a $9.7 million, or 5.3%, increase from $182.2 million in 2018. The increase in net interest income in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher average earning assets resulting from the addition of loans from the acquisition of HomeStar. This was partially offset by higher interest-bearing liabilities resulting from the addition of interest-bearing deposits from the acquisition of\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Alpine and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Alpine Bank, which operated 19 locations principally in and around the Rockford, Illinois area. The Company acquired $1.24 billion in assets, including $786.2 million in loans, and assumed $1.11 billion in deposits.\n\nTotal deposits increased $470.1 million to $4.54 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. This increase primarily resulted from $321.7 million of deposits added from the acquisition of HomeStar and organic growth, partially offset by an intentional reduction in brokered money market deposits and brokered time deposits. At December 31, 2019, total deposits were comprised of 22.4% of noninterest-bearing demand accounts, 58.4% of interest-bearing transaction accounts and 19.2% of time deposits. At December 31, 2019, brokered deposits totaled $49.7 million, or 1.1% of total deposits, compared to $161.6 million, or 4.0% of total deposits, at December 31, 2018.\nLease financing. Our equipment leasing business provides financing leases to varying types of businesses, nationwide, for purchases of business equipment and software. The financing is secured by a first priority interest in the financed asset and generally requires monthly payments.\nInterest income on loans increased $15.7 million and $8.4 million due to volume and rate, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in volume was primarily due to $211.1 million of loans and $3.6 million of loans held for sale added from the acquisition of HomeStar, and $255.4 million of growth in our equipment financing loan portfolio from $376.1 million in 2018. The reported yield on total loans was 5.27% and 5.06% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in yield on loans was primarily driven by the impact of higher market interest rates and accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on loans acquired, which totaled $12.6 million and $13.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, increasing the reported yields by 22 and 24 basis points for each respective period.\nDetermining the amount of the allowance is considered a critical accounting estimate, as it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including management's assessment of overall portfolio quality. The allowance is maintained at an amount we believe is sufficient to provide for estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and fluctuations in the provision for loan losses may result from management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our allowance, and therefore our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe are within Board policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios at December 31, 2019. The Company, at December 31, 2019 exceeded the established tolerance level for the -100 basis point sensitivity. Tolerance levels for risk management require the continuing development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within approved levels as we adjust the balance sheet. NII at Risk reported at December 31, 2019, projects that our earnings exhibit increased sensitivity at \u2212100 basis point scenario to changes in interest rates compared to December 31, 2018.\nDetermining the accretable and nonaccretable amounts at acquisition and the ongoing reevaluation of expected cash flows are considered critical accounting estimates, as these require significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including our assessment of historical loss rates, changes in the nature of the portfolio and delinquency trends.\nAs described above, one of the factors that impacts net interest income is interest rate fluctuations. The Federal Reserve implemented quarterly interest rate increases in 2018, with the last increase of 25 basis points in December 2018. These increases impact the comparability of net interest income between 2018 and 2019 because the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates by 75 basis points in the second half of 2019.\nOther noninterest expense. The $2.5 million increase in other noninterest expense was primarily due to $3.2 million of asset impairment in 2019 on one banking facility that was closed in 2019 and two additional banking facilities that were closed in the first quarter of 2020 related to our branch network consolidation plan. Additionally, in 2019, we recognized a $1.8 million loss on the repurchase of subordinated debt. These increases were partially offset by costs associated with supplies, insurance, travel, meals, postage and training incurred in 2018 related to the acquisitions of Centrue and Alpine.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold.\nWe utilize an asset risk classification system in compliance with guidelines established by the Federal Reserve as part of our efforts to improve asset quality. In connection with examinations of insured institutions, examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard,\u201d doubtful,\u201d and loss.\u201d Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable and there is a high probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. An asset classified as loss is not considered collectable and is of such little value that continuance of booking the asset is not warranted.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our average deposit balances and weighted average rates for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nResidential mortgage banking revenue. The decrease of $2.8 million in residential mortgage banking revenue reflected declines in closed production and interest rate lock commitments that were due in part to a smaller loan production team. In addition, servicing fees decreased as a result of the sale and transfer of mortgage servicing rights in 2018 and 2019. In late 2017, the Company had committed to a plan to sell mortgage servicing rights, resulting in the transfer of serviced residential mortgage loans for others to residential mortgage servicing rights held for sale.\nIncreases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period's average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the previous period's volume. Changes which are not due solely to volume or rate have been allocated proportionally to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\nSubsequent to an acquisition, we periodically evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent changes in the estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassifications between accretable yield and the nonaccretable difference. Decreases in expected cash flows due to further credit deterioration will result in an impairment charge to the provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses and a reclassification from accretable yield to nonaccretable difference. Increases in expected cash flows due to credit improvements will result in an increase in the accretable yield through a reclassification from the nonaccretable difference or as a reduction in the allowance for loan losses to the extent established on specific pools subsequent to acquisition. The adjusted accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans.\n\nWe have limited off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nAs noted above, we recorded PCI loans at estimated fair value on their acquisition date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. As a result of adding $211.1 million of loans from the acquisition of HomeStar, $786.2 million of loans from the acquisition of Alpine and $679.6 million of loans from the acquisition of Centrue, combined with net loan charge-offs of $9.9 million, $5.0 million and $8.0 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased to 0.64% at December 31, 2019 from 0.51% and 0.51% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Although the recent acquisitions have generally kept the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans ratio low, the additional specific reserves recorded in 2019 offset the benefit from the acquisition of HomeStar, causing the increase in the allowance for loan losses.\nInvestment Securities. Our investment strategy aims to maximize earnings while maintaining liquidity in securities with minimal credit risk. The types and maturities of securities purchased are primarily based on our current and projected liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions.\nData processing. The $4.5 million decrease in data processing expense primarily resulted from contract termination fees and system conversion charges in 2018 associated with the acquisition of Alpine.\nAn asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on our interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding our net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income, as rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on our interest-earning assets, thus compressing our net interest margin.\nOur strategic plan is focused on building a performance-based, customer-centric culture, seeking accretive acquisitions, creating revenue diversification, achieving operational excellence and maintaining a robust enterprise-wide risk management program. Over the past several years, we have grown organically and through a series of acquisitions, with an over-arching focus on enhancing shareholder value and building a platform for scalability. Most recently, in July 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of HomeStar and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, HomeStar Bank. In February 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Alpine and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Alpine Bank. In June 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Centrue and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Centrue Bank. In March 2017, we acquired CedarPoint, an SEC registered investment advisory firm, which was renamed Midland Financial Advisors, Inc. following the acquisition. Additional information on recent acquisitions is presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\n$132.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were pledged for securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nConstruction and land development loans. Our construction and land development loans are comprised of residential construction, commercial construction and land acquisition and development loans. Interest reserves are generally established on real estate construction loans.\n (1) Includes only those 8-rated loans that are not included in nonperforming loans. \nDetermining the fair value of our loan servicing rights for impairment assessment purposes is considered a critical accounting estimate, as it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\n\n\nDiscounts on PCI Loans. PCI loans are loans that have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. These loans are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses.\nand (2) $27.25 million, maturing on September 30, 2034 with a redemption option on or after September 30, 2029, with a fixed interest rate of 5.50% for the first ten years and a floating rate of interest equivalent to the three-month SOFR plus 404.5 basis points thereafter. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay a $30.0 million senior term loan and intends to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem existing subordinated debt which is redeemable in June 2020, and for general corporate purposes.\nThe following table contains supplemental information regarding our total contractual obligations at December 31, 2019:\nResidential real estate loans. Our residential real estate loans consist of loans for the purchase of residential properties that generally do not qualify for secondary market sale.\nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Asset. We adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019, which required the recognition of operating lease right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) assets. Operating lease ROU assets represent the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, specified assets for the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets totaled $14.2 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe principal categories of our loan portfolio are discussed below:\nItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $21.6 million and $56.8 million, respectively, available under lines of credit from the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The lines are collateralized by a collateral agreement with respect to a pool of commercial real estate loans totaling $24.3 million and $67.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCredit Reserves. One of our key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintenance of an appropriate level of reserve protection against probable losses in our loan portfolio. In 2019, our provision for loan losses was $17.0 million compared to $9.4 million in 2018 and $9.6 million in 2017.\nIndividual loans considered to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance. Factors used in determining the amount and timing of charge-offs on loans include consideration of the loan type, length of delinquency, sufficiency of collateral value, lien priority and the overall financial condition of the borrower. Collateral value is determined using updated appraisals and/or other market comparable information. Charge-offs are generally taken on loans once the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance. Net charge-offs to average loans were 0.23% and 0.13% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWealth management revenue. Noninterest income from our wealth management business increased $1.3 million primarily due to an increase in trust and estate fees, the addition of $181.2 million of assets under administration added from the acquisition of HomeStar, and a full year's effect of the addition of $1.0 billion of wealth management assets under administration from the acquisition of Alpine in February 2018.\n (3) Net interest margin during the periods presented represents: (i) the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and the interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, divided by (ii) average interest-earning assets for the period. \nThe following table shows EVE at the dates indicated:\nThe following table presents the recorded investment of potential problem commercial loans (excluding PCI loans) by loan category at the dates indicated:\nThe following table sets forth the book value, maturities and weighted average yields for our investment portfolio at December 31, 2019. The book value for investment securities classified as available for sale is equal to fair market value.\nThe following table presents average balance sheet information, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and nonperforming balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments.\nMaterial Trends and Developments\nIn 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine if our goodwill was impaired. The qualitative assessment involved the examination of changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors and other relevant entity-specific events, including changes in management and other key personnel and changes in the share price of the Company's common stock.\nLiabilities. Total liabilities increased to $5.43 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $5.03 billion at December 31, 2018. This increase primarily reflected the addition of $362.9 million of liabilities from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of HomeStar, the Company paid $1.0 million in cash and issued 404,698 shares of the Company's common stock upon the closing of the transaction on July 17, 2019. Additionally, the Company issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures in September 2019, of which a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay a $30.0 million senior term loan. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem existing subordinated debt that is redeemable in June 2020, and for general corporate purposes.\nWe have also recorded accretable discounts in purchase accounting for loans that are not considered PCI loans. Similar to the way in which we employ the fair value methodology for PCI loans, we consider expected prepayments and estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted cash flows in order to determine the accretable discount for non-PCI loans.\n\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018\n\nCommercial loans. We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial loans. The loans are typically made to small- and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital needs, business expansions and farm operations. Commercial loans generally include lines of credit and loans with maturities of five years or less. The loans are generally made with business operations as the primary source of repayment, but may also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable and equipment, and generally include personal guarantees.\nOverview. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (reprice risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers' ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors' ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR (basis risk).\nWe use what we believe is a comprehensive methodology to monitor credit quality and prudently manage credit concentration within our loan portfolio. Our underwriting policies and practices govern the risk profile and credit and geographic concentration for our loan portfolio. We also have what we believe to be a comprehensive methodology to monitor these credit quality standards, including a risk classification system that identifies potential problem loans based on risk characteristics by loan type as well as the early identification of deterioration at the individual loan level. In addition to our allowance for loan losses, our purchase discounts on acquired loans provide additional protections against credit losses.\nInterchange revenue. Noninterest income from interchange revenue increased $1.3 million due primarily to an increased level of debit card activity primarily as a result of the acquisition of HomeStar and a full year of debit card activity related to accounts acquired from Alpine.\n (1) Weighted average yield for tax-exempt securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. \n\nAverage Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis\nThe following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses, provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the years indicated:\nfuture net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, replacement reserves and other economic factors which are estimated based on current market conditions.\nIn September 2018, the Federal Reserve increased the range for the Federal Funds Target Rate, which led to an increase in the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to -100 basis points from the prior - 50 basis point floor. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a parallel 100 basis point increase or 100 basis point decrease in\nOur principal lines of business include traditional community banking, wealth management, and commercial FHA origination and servicing. Our traditional community banking business primarily consists of commercial and retail lending and deposit taking with a total loan portfolio of $4.40 billion and total deposits of $4.54 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our wealth management group provides a comprehensive suite of trust and wealth management products and services, and has grown to $3.41 billion of assets under administration as of December 31, 2019. Our commercial FHA business, which originates commercial mortgage loans for multifamily and healthcare facilities under FHA insurance programs, had $347.4 million of originations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe are within board policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios at December 31, 2019.\nAccounting policies, as described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates that are likely to occur from period to period, or using different estimates that we could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe allowance and the balance of nonaccretable discounts represent our estimate of probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in loans held for investment as of the respective balance sheet date. We assess the appropriateness of our allowance for non-PCI loans separately from our allowance for PCI loans.\n (1) Interest income and average rates for tax-exempt loans and securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018 and 35% for 2017. Tax-equivalent adjustments totaled $2.0 million, $2.1 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nNoninterest Income. The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nincluding deductions for purchase discounts. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming status because we expect to fully collect their new carrying values, which reflect significant purchase discounts. If our expectation of reasonably estimable future cash flows from PCI loans deteriorates, the loans may be classified as nonaccrual loans, and interest income will not be recognized until the timing and amount of future cash flows can be reasonably estimated.\nMortgage Servicing Rights. The Company sells residential and commercial FHA mortgage loans in the secondary market. Mortgage servicing rights ( MSR\u201d) resulting from us retaining the right to service the loans sold are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value. MSR are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assessed for impairment at each reporting date.\nThe following table shows the composition of PCI loans within our portfolio at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTotal loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased $256.7 million to $4.37 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to $211.1 million of loans added from the acquisition of HomeStar. Also contributing to the growth was organic loan growth primarily from our equipment financing business, which is booked in the commercial loans and lease financing portfolios. These increases were partially offset by several large loan payoffs and principal reductions in the commercial real estate portfolio during 2019. The $0.3 million decrease in PCI loans at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 reflected loan payoffs and repayments made throughout the year, partially offset by the addition of $17.6 million of PCI loans from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured borrowings, generally mature within one to four days from the transaction date. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. The Bank may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Investment securities with a carrying amount of $87.4 million and\nWe believe that we will be able to meet our contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. We expect to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. We have in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nOur board of directors' Risk Policy and Compliance Committee establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk. The Risk Policy and Compliance Committee establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the board of directors' policies. In general, we seek to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities. Our Risk Policy and Compliance Committee meets quarterly to monitor the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the board of directors' approved risk limits.\nNoninterest Expense. The following table sets forth the major components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nEconomic and Interest Rate Environment. The results of our operations are highly dependent on economic conditions and market interest rates. Over the past several years, economic conditions in the U.S. and our primary market areas have improved. Economic growth has been modest, the real estate market continues to improve and unemployment rates in the U.S. and our primary markets have remained low.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses, or the allowance, by loan category:\nimpairment charge of $2.1 million in 2019 as compared to a $0.5 million recovery of previous impairment charges in 2018.\nInvestment Securities. Investment securities generally must be classified as equity, held to maturity, available for sale or trading. The Company classifies debt investment its securities as available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase. Investments in stock of a publicly traded company or in mutual funds are classified as equity securities. Held-to-maturity securities are principally debt securities that we have both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Trading securities are held primarily for sale in the near term to generate income. Securities that do not meet the definition of equity, trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.\nInterest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints.\n\nThe following table shows changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nEach factor listed below materially affects the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition in 2019, 2018 and 2017, and may affect the comparability of financial information we report in future fiscal periods.\nRegulatory Environment. As a result of regulatory changes, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Rule, we expect to be subject to more restrictive capital requirements, more stringent asset concentration and growth limitations and new and potentially heightened examination and reporting requirements. We also expect to face a more challenging environment for customer loan demand due to the increased costs that could be ultimately borne by borrowers, and to incur higher costs to comply with these new regulations. This uncertain regulatory environment could have a detrimental impact on our ability to manage our business consistent with historical practices and cause difficulty in executing our growth plan. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Business Environment and Our Industry\u201d and Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nShareholders' equity increased $53.4 million to $661.9 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity was due primarily to the generation of net income of $55.8 million, $10.3 million of common equity issued for the acquisition of HomeStar, and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $9.6 million, partially offset by $23.6 million of declared dividends to common shareholders and $2.6 million of Series H preferred stock redemptions.\nIn determining the fair value of PCI loans at acquisition, we first determine the contractually required payments due, which represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payments, adjusted for the effect of estimated prepayments. We then estimate the undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect. We incorporate several key assumptions to estimate cash flows expected to be collected, including probability of default rates, loss given default assumptions and the amount and timing of prepayments. We calculate fair value by discounting the estimated cash flows we expect to collect using an observable market rate of interest, when available, adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value. We have aggregated certain credit-impaired loans acquired in the same transaction into pools based on common risk characteristics. A pool is accounted for as one asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate fair value and expected cash flows.\nInterest expense on deposits increased to $34.2 million from $22.1 million in 2018. The $12.1 million increase was primarily due to an increase of $10.3 million and $1.8 million in rate and volume of deposits, respectively. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to higher interest rates paid on deposits due to the impact of higher market interest rates. The increase in volume was primarily attributable to the addition of $321.7 million of deposits added from the acquisition of HomeStar, and an increase in our average balances of $227.9 million from our new Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d) product offering. With the increase in deposits from the acquisition of HomeStar and organically, we have been able to replace, in part, wholesale funds through the intentional decrease in brokered time deposits which results in lower average rate paid on deposits.\nCommercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans consist of both real estate occupied by the borrower for ongoing operations and non-owner occupied real estate properties. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a wide variety of property types, such as owner occupied offices, warehouses and production facilities, office buildings, hotels, mixed-use residential and commercial facilities, retail centers, multifamily properties and assisted living facilities. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio also includes farmland loans. Farmland loans are generally made to a borrower actively involved in farming rather than to passive investors.\nFor PCI loans, an allowance may be required subsequent to their acquisition. The PCI loans are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, with the estimated fair value including a component for estimated credit losses. A portion of the allowance, however, may be set aside in the future if a PCI loan pool experiences a decrease in expected cash flows as compared to those projected at the acquisition date.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses totaled $17.0 million in 2019 compared to $9.4 million in 2018. The increase in provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to an increase in charge-offs and an increase specific reserves established on nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio during 2019, coupled with growth of our loan portfolio and the resultant increase in required reserves.\nWe reevaluate our original estimates of cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the PCI loans on a quarterly basis. If it is probable, based on current information and events, that there is a significant increase in cash flows than previously expected to be collected, or if actual cash flows are significantly greater than cash flows previously expected, we adjust the amount of accretable yield by reclassification from nonaccretable difference. Conversely, if we believe we will be unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition, we establish a valuation allowance through the allowance for loan losses with a change to the provision for loan losses.\nThe fair value of investment securities is a critical accounting estimate. Changes in fair value estimates that occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that could have been reasonably used in the current period, could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nexposure to losses under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses.\nOn June 9, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Centrue and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Centrue Bank, which operated 20 full-service banking centers located principally in northern Illinois. The Company acquired $990.2 million in assets, including $679.6 million in loans, and assumed $739.9 million in deposits.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances, results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe use a ten grade risk rating system to categorize and determine the credit risk of our loans. Potential problem loans include loans with a risk grade of 7, which are \"special mention,\" and loans with a risk grade of 8, which are \"substandard\" loans that are not considered to be impaired. These loans generally require more frequent loan officer contact and receipt of financial data to closely monitor borrower performance. Potential problem loans are managed and monitored regularly through a number of processes, procedures and committees, including oversight by a loan administration committee comprised of executive officers and other members of the Bank's senior management team.\nLiquidity Management. Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders.\nLoans. The loan portfolio is the largest category of our assets. The following table presents the balance and associated percentage of each major category in our loan portfolio at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nFor discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017, refer to Item 7 of the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had capacity to borrow $481.0 million and $482.2 million, respectively, from the FHLB. The Company's advances from the FHLB are collateralized by a blanket collateral agreement of qualifying mortgage and home equity line of credit loans and certain commercial real estate loans totaling $1.94 billion and $2.22 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, must provide for its own liquidity. The Company's main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to us by the Bank. There are statutory, regulatory and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. Management believes that these limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations.\nThe following table shows NII at Risk at the dates indicated:\nWe continue to believe we have significant opportunities for further growth through additional acquisitions of banks, branches, wealth management firms and trust departments of community banks, selective de novo opportunities, continued expansion of our wealth management operations, the hiring of commercial banking and wealth management professionals from other organizations and organic growth within our existing branch network. We also believe we have the necessary experience, management and infrastructure to take advantage of these growth opportunities.\nInterest Rates and Operating Interest Differential\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company transferred the remaining $3.6 million of residential MSR to MSR held for sale. A gain of $0.5 million was recognized on MSR held for sale during 2019 and a loss of $0.5 million was recognized on MSR held for sale in 2018. In 2017, we recognized $0.8 million of impairment charges on our residential mortgage servicing rights. In 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $2.1 million on our commercial FHA mortgage servicing rights compared to $0.5 million in recoveries of previously recorded impairment charges in 2018 and impairment charges of $1.5 million in 2017.\nLoans Held for Investment. Loans held for investment includes loans we originate and retain on the balance sheet and other loans acquired through acquisition. Our accounting policies require that we evaluate all acquired loans for evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination and to evaluate whether it is probable that we will collect all contractually required payments from the borrower. Loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality are accounted for as PCI loans. For PCI loans, the amount of contractually required payments receivable in excess of the amount of future cash flows we estimate at acquisition is considered a nonaccretable difference. The PCI loans are reflected on the balance sheet based on the amount expected to be collected. In addition, the amount of future cash flows expected to be collected in excess of the fair value of the PCI loans is considered accretable yield and is recognized in interest income on a level-yield basis over the estimated life of the acquired loans.\nAllowance for non-PCI loans. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for non-PCI loans includes a general allowance for performing loans, which are grouped based on similar characteristics, and a specific allowance for individual impaired loans or loans considered by management to be in a high risk category. General allowances are established based on a number of factors, including historical loss rates, an assessment of portfolio trends and conditions, accrual status and economic conditions.\nOther noninterest income. The increase of $1.0 million in other noninterest income reflected an increase in bridge loan fees from Love Funding as well as servicing fees and gain on sale of SBA loans acquired from HomeStar. The increase was partially offset by a gain on proceeds from our bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) program in 2018 that did not recur in 2019.\n\nMidland States Bancorp, Inc. is a diversified financial holding company headquartered in Effingham, Illinois. Its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Midland States Bank, has branches across Illinois and in Missouri, and provides a full range of commercial and consumer banking products and services, business equipment financing, merchant credit card services, trust and investment management, and insurance and financial planning services. In addition, multifamily and healthcare facility FHA financing is provided through Love Funding, our non-bank subsidiary. As of December 31, 2019, we had $6.09 billion in assets, $4.54 billion of deposits and $661.9 million of shareholders' equity.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Management\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company periodically evaluates its mortgage servicing rights asset for impairment. Impairment is assessed based on the fair value of net servicing cash flows at each reporting date using estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying loans serviced and stratifications based on the risk characteristics of the underlying loans. The fair value of our servicing rights is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated\nThe difference between contractually required payments due and the cash flows expected to be collected, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference, which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, reflects estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, but is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loans, or pool of loans, using the effective yield method. The outstanding customer balance for PCI loans totaled $51.9 million and $56.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWhen the level and volume of trading activity for certain securities has significantly declined or when we believe that pricing is based in part on forced liquidation or distressed sales, we estimate fair value based on a combination of pricing information and an internal model using a discounted cash flow approach. We make certain significant assumptions in addition to those discussed above related to the liquidity risk premium, specific nonperformance and default experience in the collateral underlying the security. The values resulting from each approach are weighted to derive the final fair value for each security trading in an inactive market.\nAs of January 1, 2019, in order to not be subject to required restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonus payments, banking organizations must maintain minimum ratios of (i) Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital) , (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital), (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital), and (iv) Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets of at least 4.0%.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company and the Bank exceeded the regulatory minimums (including capital conservation buffer), and the Bank met the regulatory definition of well-capitalized based on the most recent regulatory notification.\nSalaries and employee benefits. The $5.5 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily driven by change in control payments, severance costs and other benefit-related expenses in 2018 related to the acquisition of Alpine. The decrease in expense was offset by an increase in severance and change in control costs associated with the acquisition of HomeStar in 2019.\nOn August 6, 2019, the board of directors of the Company approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of its common stock. Stock repurchases under the program maybe be made from time to time on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in any manner that complies with applicable securities laws, at the discretion of the Company. The program will be in effect until June 30, 2020, with the timing of the purchases and the number of shares repurchased under the program dependent upon a variety of factors including price, trading volume, corporate and regulatory requirements and market condition. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. As of December 31, 2019, $4.0 million, or 156,749 shares of the Company's stock, had been repurchased under the program.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses. In determining the allowance and the related provision for loan losses, we consider three principal elements: (i) valuation allowances based upon probable losses identified during the review of impaired commercial, commercial real estate, and construction and land development loans, (ii) allocations, by loan classes, on loan portfolios based on historical loan loss experience and qualitative factors, and (iii) valuation allowances on PCI loan pools based on decreases in expected cash flows. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to adjust the total allowance to a level deemed appropriate by us.\n\nFHLB Advances and Other Borrowings. FHLB advances and other borrowings totaled $493.3 million and $640.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease of $147.3 million was primarily due to $482.2 million and $32.9 million of payments made on FHLB borrowings and other borrowings, respectively, partially offset by $360.0 million of additional FHLB borrowings during 2019.\nShort-Term Borrowings. In addition to deposits, we use short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, as a source of funds to meet the daily liquidity needs of\nThe table below presents the credit ratings for our investment securities classified as available for sale, at fair value, at December 31, 2019:\nour customers and fund growth in earning assets. Short-term borrowings were $82.0 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $124.2 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by customers migrating to a new deposit product. The weighted average interest rate on our short-term borrowings was 0.67% and 0.71% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nBranch Optimization Plan. In the first quarter of 2017, we closed seven banking offices as a result of the branch network optimization plan that we announced in November 2016. In 2017, the Company announced the closure of six additional banking facilities as a result of the acquisition of Centrue. Consequently, we recorded $2.0 million of asset impairment in 2017 on these banking facilities. There was no impairment recorded in 2018. We had $1.7 million and $3.4 million of branch-related assets classified in other assets as held for sale at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the balance of accretable discounts on our PCI loan portfolio was $12.1 million compared to $12.2 million at December 31, 2018. We may not accrete the full amount of these discounts into interest income in future periods if the assets to which these discounts are applied do not perform according to our current expectations.\nPurchased Loans. Our net interest margin benefits from favorable changes in expected cash flows on our PCI loans and from accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on the non-purchased credit impaired loans ( Non-PCI loans\u201d) included in our acquisitions. Our reported net interest margins were 3.69%, 3.76% and 3.77% for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on loans acquired totaled $12.6 million, $13.4 million and $9.7 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing the reported margins by 22, 24 and 25 basis points for each respective period.\n\nRecent Acquisitions. On July 17, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of HomeStar and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, HomeStar Bank, which operated five full-service banking centers in northern Illinois. The Company acquired $367.2 million in assets, including $211.1 million in loans, and assumed $321.7 million in deposits.\n (1) Represents the percentage of the allowance to total loans in the respective category. \nthrough earnings during the periods in which they arise. Trading, equity and available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value each reporting period. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss) and do not affect earnings until realized or deemed to be OTTI. Investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost, unless deemed to be OTTI.\ninterest rates over the twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than the tolerance level. The Company, at December 31, 2019, exceeded the established tolerance level for the -100 basis point sensitivity.\nCapital Resources. Shareholders' equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, sales and redemptions of common stock and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities.\nWe report NII at Risk to isolate the change in income related solely to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The NII at Risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models \u2212100, \u221250, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months. Since short-term interest rates remained low through 2017, a NII at Risk analysis with an assumed decrease of 100 basis points did not provide meaningful results at December 31, 2017.\nOutstanding loan balances increased due to new loan originations, advances on outstanding commitments and loans acquired as a result of acquisitions of other financial institutions, net of amounts received for loan payments and payoffs, charge-offs of loans and transfers of loans to other real estate owned. The following table shows the fair values of the loans acquired during the years presented and the net growth or attrition of the acquired loans during the periods presented:\nIn May 2017, we entered into a loan agreement with another bank for a revolving line of credit in the original principal amount of up to $10.0 million and a term loan in the original principal amount of $40.0 million. In September 2019, the Company paid off the term loan from the proceeds received from the issuance of subordinated debt discussed above and terminated the revolving line of credit.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in the held for investment loan portfolio. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature of the portfolio, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses and the impacts of local, regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest-earning assets (primarily loans and securities) and interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings), is our primary source of revenue, comprising of 71.6% of 2019 revenues. Net interest income is impacted by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders' equity, also support earning assets. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets and is presented on a tax-equivalent basis to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield on a taxable asset. We used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% for 2019 and 2018.\nThe classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on these securities. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading securities flow directly\nResults of Operations\nFor commercial, commercial real estate and construction and land development loans, a specific allowance may be assigned to individual loans based on an impairment analysis. Loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The amount of impairment is based on an analysis of the most probable source of repayment, including the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows and the estimated market value or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Interest income on impaired loans is accrued as earned, unless the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we committed to a plan to sell our Fannie Mae residential mortgage servicing rights and transferred $14.2 million of residential MSR, net of valuation allowances, to MSR held for sale. As a result, we recognized a $4.1 million loss in 2017 on MSR held for sale to reflect the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. After recognizing this loss, MSR held for sale had a net carrying value of $10.2 million at December 31, 2017. We sold our Fannie Mae residential mortgage servicing rights on January 2, 2018.\nPrimary Factors Affecting Comparability\nCommercial FHA revenue. The increase of $2.2 million in commercial FHA revenue was primarily driven by an increase in gain premiums, partially offset by lower loan costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest rate lock commitments increased to $307.9 million in 2019 from $236.6 million in 2018. Additionally, originations increased to $347.4 million in 2019 from $314.7 million in 2018. These increases were partially offset by an\nCommunity Banking. We believe the most important trends affecting community banks in the United States over the foreseeable future will be related to heightened regulatory capital requirements, increasing regulatory burdens generally, including the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations to be promulgated thereunder, and interest margin compression. We expect that community banks will face increased competition for lower cost capital as a result of regulatory policies that may offer larger financial institutions greater access to government assistance than is available for smaller institutions, including community banks. We expect that troubled community banks will continue to face significant challenges when attempting to raise capital. We also believe that heightened regulatory capital requirements will make it more difficult for even well-capitalized, healthy community banks to grow in their communities by taking advantage of opportunities in their markets that result as the economy continues to improve. We believe these trends will favor community banks that have sufficient capital, a diversified business model and a strong deposit franchise, and we believe we possess these characteristics.\nLoan Quality\nIn October 2017, we issued subordinated notes totaling $40.0 million, maturing on October 15, 2027, with a fixed rate of interest of 6.25% for the first five years and a floating rate of interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 422.9 basis points thereafter.\nWe guarantee the distributions and payments for redemption or liquidation of the trust preferred securities issued by our wholly owned subsidiary business trusts to the extent of funds held by the trusts. Although this guarantee is not separately recorded, the obligation underlying the guarantee is fully reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as junior subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts. The junior subordinated debentures currently qualify as Tier 1 capital under the Federal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $16.7 million in 2019 compared to $11.4 million in 2018. Effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 were 23.0% and 22.4%, respectively. The increase of the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the BOLI death benefit recorded in 2018.\nFinancial Condition\nOur other intangible assets, which consist of core deposit and trust relationship intangibles, were $34.9 million and $37.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in other intangibles was due to amortization expense of $7.1 million, partially offset by the $4.6 million in acquired intangibles from the acquisition of HomeStar.\nCapital Raising Transactions. On September 20, 2019, we issued, through a private placement, $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes, which was structured into two tranches: (1) $72.75 million, maturing on September 30, 2029 with a redemption option on or after September 30, 2024, with a fixed rate of interest of 5.00% for the first five years and a floating rate of interest equivalent to three-month SOFR plus 361.0 basis points thereafter,\nThe EVE reported at December 31, 2019 projects that as interest rates increase, the economic value of equity position will increase, and as interest rates decrease, the economic value of equity position will decrease. When interest rates rise, fixed rate assets generally lose economic value; the longer the duration, the greater the value lost. The opposite is true when interest rates fall.\n (2) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. Interest income on loans includes amortization of deferred loan fees, net of deferred loan costs. \nImpaired Loans. The following table sets forth our nonperforming assets by asset categories as of the dates indicated. Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and loans modified under troubled debt restructurings. The balances of impaired loans reflect the net investment in these assets,\n\nInterest expense on subordinated debt increased $1.3 million to $7.4 million due primarily to the issuance of $100.0 million of subordinated debt in September 2019. The increase was partially offset by the redemption of $16.5 million of subordinated debt during the fourth quarter of 2019. In turn, the reported yield decreased 24 basis points to 6.20% in 2019.\nIn 2019, the Company closed one facility and consolidated two additional facilities as a result of the acquisition of HomeStar. In addition, the Company planned to consolidate three other existing facilities in other areas of its footprint, one of which closed in 2019 and the remaining two facilities closed in January 2020. Consequently, in 2019, the Company recorded $3.2 million of asset impairment on banking facilities to be closed. We had $4.0 million of branch-related assets classified as held for sale in other assets at December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had federal funds lines of credit available totaling $20.0 \u00admillion. These lines of credit were unused as of December 31, 2019.\nGoodwill. Our goodwill impairment test is performed as of September 30th each year and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are defined as the same level as, or one level below, an operating segment. An operating segment is a component of a business for which separate financial information is available that management regularly evaluates in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.\nOur principal business activity has been lending to and accepting deposits from individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities. We have derived income principally from interest charged on loans and leases and, to a lesser extent, from interest and dividends earned on investment securities. We have also derived income from noninterest sources, such as: fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services; wealth management services; commercial FHA mortgage loan originations, sales and servicing; residential mortgage loan originations and sales; and, from time to time, gains on sales of assets. Our principal expenses include interest expense on deposits and borrowings, operating expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, data processing costs, professional fees and other noninterest expenses, provisions for loan losses and income tax expense.\nFDIC insurance. The $1.4 million decrease in FDIC insurance was primarily due to small business tax credits received from the FDIC. The credit was awarded by the FDIC to banks with total consolidated assets less than $10.0 billion for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the FDIC's reserve ratio. The Company has recognized $0.9 million in credits and expects to recognize additional credits of $0.6 million in future periods.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill was $171.8 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $164.7 million at December 31, 2018. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid in an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The $7.1 million increase in 2019 resulted from goodwill associated with the acquisition of HomeStar.\nLoan Servicing Rights. The Company sells residential mortgage loans, commercial FHA mortgage loans and SBA loans in the secondary market. Loan servicing rights resulting from us retaining the right to service the loans sold are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value. Loan servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income.\nCapital Raising Initiatives. One component of our initiative-driven strategic plan is to pursue accretive acquisitions. We have been able to implement our acquisition strategy due to several significant capital raising transactions. These transactions are described above in the section under Primary Factors Affecting Comparability-Capital Raising Transactions.\u201d These capital raising transactions have also supported our organic growth strategies.\n (1) As a result of accounting guidance adopted by the Company in the first quarter of 2018, equity securities were no longer presented within available for sale securities after such adoption. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previous GAAP. \nThe following table sets forth the book value and percentage of each category of investment securities at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The book value for investment securities classified as available for sale is equal to fair market value.\n (1) Total capital (to risk-weighted assets), Common Equity Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) and Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) includes the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. \nOperating Lease Liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019 also required the recognition of operating lease liabilities. Operating lease liabilities represent a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis. Operating lease liabilities totaled $15.4 million at December 31, 2019.\n\nIncome Simulation and Economic Value Analysis. Interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the Risk Policy and Compliance Committee at least quarterly. The information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk.\nThe following table sets forth the maturity of time deposits of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019:\nStandby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event that the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements.\nThe EVE results included in the table above reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models immediate \u2212100, \u221250, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates.\nHomeStar, as well as increased usage of FHLB advances as a funding source and the issuance of subordinated debt in September 2019.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Selected Financial Data,\u201d our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those set forth under Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\u201d Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. Readers of our Annual Report on Form 10-K should therefore consider these risks and uncertainties in evaluating forward-looking statements and should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nOverview. In 2019, we generated net income of $55.8 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $2.26, compared to $39.4 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $1.66, in 2018 and $16.1 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $0.87, in 2017. The 2019 earnings included a $9.7 million increase in net interest income, a $3.5 million increase in noninterest income and a $16.0 million decrease in noninterest expense. These results were partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in the provision for loan losses and a $5.3 million increase in income tax expense. The successful conversion and integration of our acquisition of HomeStar, our strong business development highlighted by growth in both loans and deposits and our focus on developing new depository products for commercial customers had a positive impact on our core deposit gathering, resulting in a steady improvement in our deposit mix, and all contributed to positive 2019 performance when compared to 2018.\nOverview\nWe use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net Interest Income at Risk ( NII at Risk\u201d) and Economic Value of Equity ( EVE\u201d). Under NII at Risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivatives. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE is a period end measurement.\nMarket Risk. Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from investments in securities backed by mortgage loans.\nProfessional fees. The $4.0 million decrease in professional fees was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees incurred on various technology and other integration related projects in 2018 associated primarily with the acquisition of Alpine.\nDeferred Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Accounting for deferred income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. Management's determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, reversing temporary differences which may offset, and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. These judgments and estimates are inherently subjective and reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period, which would negatively affect earnings.\n\nWe also believe that increased regulatory burdens will have a significant adverse effect on smaller community banks, which often lack the personnel, experience and technology to efficiently comply with new regulations in a variety of areas in the banking industry, including in the areas of deposits, lending, compensation, information security and overdraft protection. We believe the increased costs to smaller community banks from a more complex regulatory environment, coupled with challenges in the real estate lending area, present attractive acquisition opportunities for larger community banks that have already made significant investments in regulatory compliance and risk management and can acquire and quickly integrate these smaller institutions into their existing platform. Furthermore, we believe that, as a result of our significant operational investments and our experience acquiring other institutions and quickly integrating them into our organization, we are well positioned to capitalize on the challenges facing smaller community banks.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $28.0 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $20.9 million at December 31, 2018. The $7.1 million increase in the allowance was mainly attributable to a $4.7 million increase in specific reserves related primarily to commercial loans that were classified as nonaccrual during 2019.\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement information of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nIntegral to our liquidity management is the administration of short-term borrowings. To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we seek to meet our liquidity needs through wholesale funding or other borrowings, including our ability to borrow from the FHLB, on either a short- or long-term basis.\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe fair values of investment securities are generally determined by various pricing models. We evaluate the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values. We perform a quarterly analysis on the pricing of investment securities to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. Our procedures include initial and ongoing review of pricing methodologies and trends. We seek to ensure prices represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of broker quotes, current sales transactions from our portfolio and pricing techniques, which are based on the net present value of future expected cash flows discounted at a rate of return market participants would require. Significant inputs used in internal pricing techniques are estimated by type of underlying collateral, estimated prepayment speeds where applicable and appropriate discount rates. As a result of this analysis, if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value, the price is adjusted accordingly.\nWe did not recognize any interest income on nonaccrual loans during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 while they were in nonaccrual status. Additional interest income that we would have recognized on these loans had they been current in accordance with their original terms was $2.2 million, $1.8 million and $0.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We recognized interest income on commercial and commercial real estate loans modified under troubled debt restructurings of $0.1 million during each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe following table shows the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio and the distribution between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans at December 31, 2019:\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action\u201d, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies.\n\nPrice Risk. Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from equity investments and investments in mortgage-backed securities.", "item_7_tables": "Table 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

report:\n\nOverview\n- In 2019, Midland States Bancorp generated net income of $55.8 million, up from $39.4 million in 2018, due to increases in net interest income, noninterest income, and lower noninterest expense. This was partially offset by higher provision for loan losses and income taxes.\n\nNet Interest Income \n- Net interest income was $191.9 million in 2019, up 5.3% from 2018, primarily due to loan growth from acquisitions and organically in equipment financing. This was partially offset by higher interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\n- Provision increased to $17.0 million in 2019 from $9.4 million in 2018, mainly due to more charge-offs, increases in specific reserves, and loan portfolio growth.\n\nNoninterest Income and Expense\n- Noninterest income rose 4.9% to $75.3 million in 2019, helped by wealth management and interchange revenue. Noninterest expense decreased 8.3% to $175.6 million, largely due to lower salaries, data processing, and professional fees.\n\nLoans and Deposits\n- Total loans grew 6.4% to $4.40 billion at December 31, 2019, including $211.1 million from the HomeStar acquisition. Total deposits rose 11.8% to $4.54 billion, with $321.7 million added from HomeStar. \n\nCapital \n- Shareholders' equity increased by $53.4 million in 2019 to $661.9 million due to earnings generation, common equity issued for HomeStar, and higher accumulated other comprehensive income."}
