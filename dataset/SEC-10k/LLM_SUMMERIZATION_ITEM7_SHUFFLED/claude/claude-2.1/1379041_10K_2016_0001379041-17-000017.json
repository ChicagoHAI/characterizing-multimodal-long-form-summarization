Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes thereto, and the financial statement schedules included in Item 8 and Item 15 of this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors described in Item 1A of this report. Our actual results in future periods may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including the risks described in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a Nevada holding company. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to select, small businesses in low to medium hazard industries. Workers' compensation insurance is provided under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees' medical, disability, vocational rehabilitation, and/or death benefit costs for work-related injuries or illnesses. We provide workers' compensation insurance in 36 states and the District of Columbia, with a concentration in California, where over one-half of our business is generated. Our revenues are primarily comprised of net premiums earned, net investment income, and net realized gains on investments.\nWe target small businesses, as we believe that this market is traditionally characterized by fewer competitors, more attractive pricing, and stronger persistency when compared to the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry in general. We believe we are able to price our policies at levels that are competitive and profitable over the long-term given our expertise in underwriting this market segment. Our underwriting approach is to consistently underwrite small business accounts at appropriate and competitive prices without sacrificing long-term profitability and stability for short-term top-line revenue growth.\nOur underwriting results have improved over the past several years, which reflects the increased pricing flexibility afforded to us through the use of multiple writing companies within a state and territorial pricing in California. In addition, our ongoing underwriting initiatives, which are described below, have allowed us to expand our operations while also focusing on under-performing classes of business, as needed.\nResults of Operations\nA primary measure of our performance is our ability to increase Adjusted stockholders' equity over the long-term. We believe that this measure is important to our investors, analysts, and other interested parties who benefit from having an objective and consistent basis for comparison with other companies within our industry. The following table shows a reconciliation of our stockholders' equity on a GAAP basis to our Adjusted stockholders' equity.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred reinsurance gain-LPT Agreement\n</td> <td>174.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Accumulated other comprehensive income, net\n</td> <td>74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted stockholders' equity(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>941.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Adjusted stockholders' equity is a non-GAAP measure consisting of total GAAP stockholders' equity plus the Deferred Gain, less Accumulated other comprehensive income, net.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our net income was $106.7 million, $94.4 million, and $100.7 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and our underwriting income was $57.3 million, $40.4 million, and $20.6 million for the same periods, respectively.

Collectively, these items increased our net income before taxes by $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following noteworthy items were included in our 2015 results of operations: (1) favorable prior year accident year loss development of $7.2 million, including $9.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary business, partially offset by $1.8 million of unfavorable development on our assigned risk business, which decreased our losses and LAE by the same amount; (2) favorable development in the estimated reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement that resulted in a $6.4 million LPT Reserve Adjustment; (3) an increase in the contingent commission receivable under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $2.6 million LPT Contingent Commission Adjustment; and (4) a reallocation of $56.3 million of losses and LAE reserves from non-taxable periods prior to January 1, 2000, which reduced our effective tax rate by 15.4 percentage points. Collectively, these items increased our net income before taxes by $16.2 million and decreased our income tax expense by $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following noteworthy items were included in our 2014 results of operations: (1) favorable development in the estimated reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $31.1 million LPT Reserve Adjustment; (2) an increase in the contingent commission receivable under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $10.8 million LPT Contingent Commission Adjustment; and (3) a reallocation of $13.1 million of losses and LAE reserves from non-taxable periods prior to January 1, 2000, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.4 percentage points. Collectively, these items increased our net income before taxes by $41.9 million and decreased our income tax expense by $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe comparative components of net income are set forth in the following table:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>701.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>697.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>697.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>694.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>689.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>687.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>694.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>690.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>684.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>73.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains (losses) on investments\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>779.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>752.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>773.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>417.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>429.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>453.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expense\n</td> <td>83.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting and other operating expenses\n</td> <td>136.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>34.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>673.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>657.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>672.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amortization of the Deferred Gain related to losses\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amortization of the Deferred Gain related to contingent commission\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less impact of LPT Reserve Adjustments(1)\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less impact of LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments(2)\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before impact of the LPT Agreement(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>LPT Reserve Adjustments result in a cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, which is recognized in losses and LAE incurred on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, such that the Deferred Gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the LPT Agreement.

The Deferred Gain reflects the unamortized gain from the LPT Agreement. Under GAAP, this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method in which amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries over the life of the LPT Agreement, except for the contingent profit commission, which is amortized through June 30, 2024. The amortization is reflected in losses and LAE. We periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the LPT Agreement and the expected losses and LAE subject to the contingent profit commission under the LPT Agreement. Our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments, if needed, to reserves, ceded reserves, contingent commission receivable, and the Deferred Gain, with the net effect being an increase or decrease to our net income. Net income before impact of the LPT Agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, but rather reflects the difference in accounting treatment between statutory and GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income before income taxes or net income, or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We present net income before impact of the LPT Agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of our ongoing operating performance to be used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating us. The LPT Agreement was a non-recurring transaction, under which the Deferred Gain does not affect our ongoing operations, and, consequently, we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance. In addition, we believe this non-GAAP measure, as we have defined it, is helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the excluded item has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations.\nGross Premiums Written\nGross premiums written were $701.4 million, $697.7 million, and $697.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in final audit premiums and growth in new business premium, partially offset by lower levels of renewal premiums, year-over-year. The declines in renewal premiums in 2016, compared to 2015, were due to declines in the LA Area of California, partially offset by increases in states outside California, as well as territories outside of the LA Area of California. While overall renewal premiums were down slightly year-over-year, primarily driven by lower net rates, our policy unit retention rate increased in 2016. Gross premiums written in 2015 were relatively flat compared to 2014; however, certain strategic initiatives, including diversifying our risk exposure across our markets and non-renewing under-performing business, resulted in a decline in premiums in California, while we increased premiums in other states.\nNet Premiums Written\nNet premiums written were $694.6 million, $689.3 million, and $687.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, which included $6.8 million, $8.4 million, and $10.1 million of reinsurance premiums ceded, respectively. The decreases in reinsurance premiums ceded from 2014 to 2016 reflect the increases in our retention on a per occurrence basis under our current excess of loss reinsurance program compared to earlier periods.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet premiums earned were $694.8 million, $690.4 million, and $684.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Net premiums earned are primarily a function of the amount and timing of net premiums previously written.\nThe following table shows the percentage change in our in-force premiums, policy count, average policy size, payroll exposure upon which our premiums are based, and net rate as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, overall, for California, where 56% of our premiums were generated, and for all other states, excluding California:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n2016 Over 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n2015 Over 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Overall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>All Other States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Overall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>All Other States\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force premiums\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force policy count\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average in-force policy size\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force payroll exposure\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net rate(1)\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Net rate, defined as total in-force premiums divided by total insured payroll exposure, is a function of a variety of factors, including rate changes, underwriting risk profiles and pricing, and changes in business mix related to economic and competitive pressures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments\nWe invest in fixed maturity securities, equity securities, short-term investments, and cash equivalents. Net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities, less bank service charges and custodial and portfolio management fees. We have established a high quality/short duration bias in our investment portfolio.\nNet investment income was $73.2 million, $72.2 million, and $72.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The average pre-tax book yield on our invested assets was 3.1%, 3.2%, and 3.2% at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The average tax-equivalent yield on our invested assets, which adjusts the book yield of our investments in tax-advantaged securities to an equivalent pre-tax book yield, was 3.6%, 3.8%, and 3.8% as of the same dates, respectively.\nRealized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Realized gains and losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original or adjusted cost (equity securities) or amortized cost (fixed maturity securities). Realized losses are also recognized when securities are written down as a result of an other-than-temporary impairment.\nNet realized gains (losses) on investments were $11.2 million, $(10.7) million, and $16.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Net realized gains on investments in 2016 were primarily the result of the sale of equity securities as part of a re-balancing of our equity investments portfolio to meet cash needs at the holding company, and to provide cash to support the internal restructuring of our insurance subsidiaries. Those gains were partially offset by $5.8 million in other-than-temporary impairments of certain equity securities due to our intent to sell securities, and the downturn in the energy sector during that year. Net realized losses on investments in 2015 were primarily the result of other-than-temporary impairments of certain equity securities during the fourth quarter due to the downturn in the energy sector during that year. The net realized gains on investments for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to a re-balancing of our equity investment portfolio. Additional information regarding our Investments is set forth under -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Investments\u201d and Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Income\nOther income consists of net gains on fixed assets, non-investment interest, and other miscellaneous income. Other income was $0.6 million, $0.2 million, and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nLosses and LAE, Commission Expenses, and Underwriting and Other Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents our calendar year combined ratios.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>60.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting and other operating expenses ratio\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expense ratio\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>91.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnlike many other insurance companies, we include all of the operating expenses of our holding company in the calculation of our combined ratio, which served to increase our combined ratios by two percentage points in each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nLoss and LAE Ratio.\nWe analyze our loss and LAE ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis.\nThe calendar year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and LAE incurred during the calendar year, regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred, by the net premiums earned during that calendar year. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and LAE established for insured events occurring in the current and prior years. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods.\nThe accident year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing losses and LAE, regardless of when such losses and LAE are incurred, for insured events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year. The accident year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year develop favorably or unfavorably. The accident year loss and LAE ratio is based on our statutory financial statements and is not derived from our GAAP financial information.\nWe analyze our calendar year loss and LAE ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and LAE from all periods, including development (whether\nfavorable or unfavorable) of reserves established in prior periods. In contrast, we analyze our accident year loss and LAE ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and LAE from insured events occurring during that year. The loss and LAE ratios provided in this report are calendar year basis, except where they are expressly identified as accident year loss and LAE ratios.\nLosses and LAE represents our largest expense item and includes claim payments made, amortization of the Deferred Gain, LPT Reserve Adjustments, LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments, estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods, and costs associated with investigating, defending, and adjusting claims. The quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and LAE, which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques.\nOur indemnity claims frequency (the number of claims expressed as a percentage of payroll) continued to decrease year-over-year in 2016 and 2015; however, our loss experience indicates a slight upward movement in medical and indemnity costs per claim that are reflected in our current accident year loss estimates. In California, we experienced increased costs per claim associated with an increase in the number of cumulative trauma claims filed during 2015, compared to 2014. Total claims costs have also been reduced by cost savings associated with increased claims settlement activity beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2016. We believe our current accident year loss estimate is adequate; however, ultimate losses will not be known with any certainty for many years. We assume that increasing medical and indemnity cost trends will continue to impact our long-term claims costs and current accident year loss estimate, which may be offset by rate increases. Additional information regarding our reserves for losses and LAE is set forth under -Critical Accounting Policies-Reserves for Losses and LAE.\u201d\nOverall, losses and LAE were $417.9 million, $429.4 million, and $453.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in our losses and LAE from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to $18.4 million of net favorable prior accident year loss development in 2016 (versus $7.2 million of net favorable development in 2015), which included $17.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary risk business and $1.4 million of favorable development related to our assigned risk business. The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily related to $7.2 million of net favorable prior accident year loss development (versus $4.6 million of net unfavorable development in 2014), which included $9.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary risk business in 2015, which was partially offset by $1.8 million of unfavorable loss development related to our assigned risk business, and a decrease in the current accident year loss estimate. The favorable prior accident year loss development in 2016 and 2015 was the result of our determination that adjustments were necessary to reflect observed favorable paid loss trends in each of these years. Paid loss trends have been impacted by cost savings associated with accelerated claims settlement activity that began in 2014 and continued through 2016. The unfavorable prior accident year loss development in 2014 was primarily related to our assigned risk business. Additionally, there were favorable LPT Reserve Adjustments of $3.1 million, $6.4 million, and $31.1 million that decreased losses and LAE by those amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nOur current accident year loss estimates were 65.2%, 66.2%, and 73.6% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decreasing trend in our current accident year loss estimates reflects the impact of key business initiatives, including: accelerating the settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, underwrite, and price profitable classes of business across all of our markets. In addition, we have increased rates in the LA Area in California limiting our growth in that territory, while we continue to grow in other territories within and outside of California. The current accident year loss estimate for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the impact of $6.5 million in large losses recognized in the second quarter of 2016, which increased the current accident year loss estimate for the year.\nExcluding the impact from the LPT Agreement, losses and LAE would have been $434.5 million, $449.8 million, and $508.4 million, or 62.5%, 65.2%, and 74.3% of net premiums earned, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nThe table below reflects losses and LAE reserve adjustments and the impact of the LPT on net income before taxes.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior accident year favorable (unfavorable) development, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of the Deferred Gain related to losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of the Deferred Gain related to contingent commission\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of LPT Reserve Adjustments\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total impact of the LPT\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total losses and LAE reserve adjustments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnderwriting and Other Operating Expenses Ratio.\nUnderwriting and other operating expenses are those costs that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue, excluding commission. These expenses include premium taxes and certain other general expenses that vary with, and are primarily related to, producing new or renewal business. Other underwriting expenses include policyholder dividends, changes in estimates of future write-offs of premiums receivable, general administrative expenses such as salaries and benefits, rent, office supplies, depreciation, and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately. Policy acquisition costs are variable based on premiums earned. Other operating expenses are more fixed in nature and become a smaller percentage of net premiums earned as premiums increase.\nOur underwriting and other operating expenses ratio was 19.7%, 19.5%, and 18.9%, and our underwriting and other operating expenses were $136.1 million, $135.2 million, and $129.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our compensation-related expenses increased $2.3 million and premium taxes and assessments increased $1.5 million, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in our bad debt expense, each as compared to 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our bad debt expense increased $2.8 million, compensation-related expenses increased $1.5 million, professional fees increased $1.2 million, and IT expense increased $0.9 million, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in our premium taxes and assessments, each as compared to 2014.\nCommission Expense Ratio.\nCommission expenses include direct commissions to our agents and brokers for the premiums that they produce for us, as well as incentive payments, other marketing costs, and fees. Some of our agency contracts contain incentive clauses, and the terms of those agency incentives are specific to individual contracts and vary as a result of agency performance.\nOur commission expense ratio was 12.0%, 12.4%, and 11.9%, and our commission expenses were $83.5 million, $85.4 million, and $81.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in our commission expense ratio in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to lower agency incentives. The increase in the commission expense ratio in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to higher agency incentives.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOn January 1, 2000, EICN assumed the assets, liabilities, and operations of the Fund pursuant to legislation passed in the 1999 Nevada Legislature (the Privatization). Prior to the Privatization, the Fund was part of the State of Nevada and therefore was not subject to federal income tax. Accordingly, our pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments and Deferred Gain amortization impact our net income but do not change our taxable income.\nIncome tax expense was $34.0 million, $5.0 million, and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 24.2%, 5.0%, and 5.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. For 2016, tax-advantaged investment income, LPT Reserve Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory 35% rate by $15.3 million. For 2015, tax-advantaged investment income, pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory 35% rate by $29.8 million. For 2014, tax-advantaged investment income, pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory 35% rate by $31.4 million.\nFor additional information regarding our income tax expense see Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHolding Company Liquidity\nWe are a holding company and our ability to fund our operations is contingent upon existing capital and the ability of our insurance subsidiaries' to pay dividends up to the holding company. Payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws and regulations, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. We require cash to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, make interest and principal payments on any outstanding debt obligations, provide additional surplus to our insurance subsidiaries, and fund our operating expenses.\nOur insurance subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to their parent is based on reported capital, surplus, and dividends paid within the last 12 months. For 2017, EICN and EPIC cannot pay any dividends without prior regulatory approval; ECIC can pay $4.6 million of dividends through June 21, 2017 and $38.1 million thereafter without prior regulatory approval, provided that no dividends are paid prior to June 21, 2017; and EAC can pay $18.0 million of dividends beginning July 6, 2017 without prior regulatory approval.\nTotal cash and investments at the holding company were $57.3 million at December 31, 2016, consisting of $41.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $16.0 million of fixed maturity securities. We do not currently have a revolving credit facility because\nwe believe that the holding company's cash needs for the foreseeable future will be met with its cash and investments on hand, as well as dividends available from its insurance subsidiaries.\nOperating Subsidiaries' Liquidity\nThe primary sources of cash for our insurance operating subsidiaries are premium collections, investment income, sales and maturities of investments and reinsurance recoveries. The primary uses of cash for our insurance subsidiaries are payments of losses and LAE, commission expenses, underwriting and other operating expenses, ceded reinsurance, investment purchases and dividends paid to their parent.\nTotal cash and investments held by our operating subsidiaries was $2,560.5 million at December 31, 2016, consisting of $23.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $16.0 million of short-term investments, $2,328.4 million of fixed maturity securities and $192.2 million of equity securities. Sources of immediate and unencumbered liquidity at our operating subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 consisted of $20.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, $142.0 million of publicly-traded equity securities whose proceeds are available within four business days, and $1.3 billion of highly liquid fixed maturity securities whose proceeds are available within four business days. We believe that our subsidiaries' liquidity needs over the next 24 months will be met with cash from operations, investment income, and maturing investments.\nEach of our insurance subsidiaries became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) in January 2016. Membership allows our subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support and enhance liquidity management. The amount of advances that may be taken is dependent on statutory admitted assets on a per company basis. Currently, none of our subsidiaries has advances outstanding under the FHLB facility.\nWe purchase reinsurance to protect us against the costs of severe claims and catastrophic events. On July 1, 2016, we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through June 30, 2017. The reinsurance program consists of one treaty covering excess of loss and catastrophic loss events in four layers of coverage. Our reinsurance coverage is $190.0 million in excess of our $10.0 million retention on a per occurrence basis, subject to certain exclusions. We believe that our excess of loss reinsurance program currently meets our needs.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis. Surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets. The amount of capital in our insurance subsidiaries is maintained relative to standardized capital adequacy measures such as risk-based capital (RBC), as established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The RBC standard was designed to provide a measure by which regulators can assess the adequacy of an insurance company's capital and surplus relative to its operations. An insurance company must maintain capital and surplus of at least 200% of RBC. Each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the minimum RBC requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action at December 31, 2016.\nVarious state laws and regulations require us to hold investment securities or letters of credit on deposit with certain states in which we do business. Securities having a fair value of $1,009.7 million and $881.2 million were on deposit at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These laws and regulations govern both the amount and types of investment securities that are eligible for deposit. Additionally, certain reinsurance contracts require company funds to be held in trust for the benefit of the ceding reinsurer to secure the outstanding liabilities we assumed. The fair value of fixed maturity securities held in trust for the benefit of our ceding reinsurers was $27.2 million and $32.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe monitor the cash flows of each of our subsidiaries individually, as well as collectively as a consolidated group. We use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs, making adjustments to our forecasts as appropriate.\nThe table below shows our net cash flows. For additional information regarding our cash flows, see Item 8, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(88.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(23.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2016 included net premiums received of $694.9 million, and investment income received of $87.8 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $433.7 million, underwriting and other operating expenses paid of $125.8 million, and commissions paid of $84.2 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2015 included net premiums received of $678.9 million, and investment income received of $84.9 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $427.7 million, underwriting and other operating expenses paid of $121.3 million, and commissions paid of $82.9 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2014 included net premiums received of $673.7 million, and investment income received of $82.7 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $386.6 million, underwriting and other operating expenses paid of $122.6 million, and commissions paid of $78.9 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2016, 2015, and 2014 was primarily related to the investment of premiums received and the reinvestment of funds from maturities, redemptions, and interest income. These investing cash outflows were partially offset by investment sales whose proceeds were used to fund claims payments, underwriting and other operating expenses, common stock dividend payments, and common stock repurchases.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2016 included purchases of our common stock and payments of dividends to common stockholders. These financing cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from stock-based compensation, mainly proceeds from exercises of stock options.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2015 and 2014 included payments of dividends to common stockholders and repayment of notes payable and capital leases. These financing cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from stock-based compensation, mainly proceeds and income tax benefits from exercises of stock options.\nDividends. Dividends paid to stockholders were $11.5 million, $7.7 million, and $7.6 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends to common stockholders will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial position, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, legal and regulatory requirements, and any other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. On February 22, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a $0.15 dividend per share, payable March 22, 2017, to stockholders of record on March 8, 2017.\nShare Repurchases. On February 16, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $50.0 million of our common stock from February 22, 2016 through February 22, 2018 (the 2016 Program). We expect that shares of common stock may be purchased at prevailing market prices through a variety of methods, including open market or private transactions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and as determined by management. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and economic conditions. Repurchases under the 2016 Program may be commenced, modified, or suspended from time-to-time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2016, we had a remaining common stock repurchase authorization of $28.9 million under the 2016 Program. See Item 5, Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nCapital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, the capital resources available to us consisted of: (i) $32.0 million of notes payable consisting of surplus notes maturing in 2034; (ii) $840.6 million of stockholders' equity; and (iii) the $174.9 million Deferred Gain.\nThe following outlines each component of our total capital resources:\nNotes Payable. The surplus notes bear interest at a fixed rate of between 405 and 425 basis points in excess of the 90-day LIBOR per annum, payable quarterly. We may redeem the surplus notes at any time at their face value of $32.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The surplus notes mature in 2034.\nBoth the payment of interest and repayment of the surplus notes are subject to the prior approval of the Florida Department of Financial Services.\nStockholders' Equity.

We also utilize Conning's investment advisory services. These services include investment accounting and portfolio modeling using DFA. The DFA tool is utilized in developing a tailored set of portfolio targets and objectives, which in turn, are considered when constructing an optimal portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our investment portfolio, which is classified as available-for-sale, consisted of 91.9% fixed maturity securities. We strive to limit the interest rate risk associated with fixed maturity investments by managing the duration of these securities. Our fixed maturity securities (excluding cash and cash equivalents) had a duration of 4.3 years at December 31, 2016. To minimize interest rate risk, our portfolio is weighted toward short-term and intermediate-term bonds; however, our investment strategy balances consideration of duration, yield, and credit risk. Our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio be AA-,\u201d using ratings assigned by S&P. Our fixed maturity securities portfolio had a weighted average quality of AA-\u201d as of December 31, 2016, with 57.2% of the portfolio rated AA\u201d or better, based on market value.\nWe also have a modest portfolio of equity securities, which we record at fair value. We strive to limit the exposure to equity price risk associated with equity securities by investing primarily in mid-to-large capitalization issuers and by diversifying our holdings across several industry sectors. Equity securities represented 7.5% of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2016.\nWe believe that our current asset allocation meets our strategy to preserve capital for claims and policy liabilities and to provide sufficient capital resources to support and grow our ongoing insurance operations.\nThe following table shows the estimated fair value, the percentage of the fair value to total invested assets, the average book yield, and the average tax equivalent yield (each based on the fair value of each category of invested assets) as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Book Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tax Equivalent Yield\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasuries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>States and municipalities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>956.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgaged-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial mortgaged-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,552.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the percentage of total estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2016 by credit rating category, using the lower of ratings assigned by Moody's Investors Service and/or S&P.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\nEstimated Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> AAA\u201d\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> AA\u201d\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> A\u201d\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> BBB\u201d\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Below Investment Grade\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestments that we currently own could be subject to default by the issuer or could suffer declines in fair value that become other-than-temporary. We regularly assess individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management, including the identification of other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Our other-than-temporary impairment assessment includes reviewing the extent and duration of declines in fair value of investments below amortized cost, historical and projected financial performance and near-term prospects of the issuer, the outlook for industry sectors, credit rating, and macro-economic changes. We also make a\ndetermination as to whether it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its fair value recovers above cost, or maturity.\nWe believe that we have appropriately identified the declines in the fair values of our unrealized losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. We determined that the unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily the result of prevailing interest rates and not the credit quality of the issuers. The fixed maturity securities whose fair value was less than amortized cost were not determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired given the lack of severity and duration of the impairment, the credit quality of the issuers, the Company's intent to not sell the securities, and a determination that it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities until fair value recovers to above cost, or principal value upon maturity.\nWe recognized impairments of $5.8 million (consisting of 37 equity securities), $17.2 million (consisting of 27 equity securities), and $0.5 million (consisting of seven equity securities) during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The other-than temporary impairments recognized during these years related to equity securities were the result of the Company's intent to sell and/or the severity and duration of the change in fair values of these securities, primarily due to the downturn in the energy sector that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Certain unrealized losses on equity securities were not considered to be other-than-temporary due to the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers, and our intent to hold the securities until fair value recovers to above cost.\nFor additional information regarding our investments, including the cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and estimated fair value of our investments, the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities by contractual maturity, and net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) on fixed maturity and equity securities, see Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. Our accounting policies are described in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, but we believe that the following matters are particularly important to understand our financial statements because changes in these estimates or changes in the assumptions used to make them could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nReserves for Losses and LAE\nAccounting for workers' compensation insurance requires us to estimate the liability for the expected ultimate cost of unpaid losses and LAE (loss reserves) as of a balance sheet date. Loss reserve estimates are inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount we pay for many of the claims we have incurred as of the balance sheet date will not be known for many years. Our estimate of loss reserves is intended to equal the difference between the expected ultimate losses and LAE of all claims that have occurred as of a balance sheet date and amounts already paid. We establish loss reserves based on our own analysis of emerging claims experience and environmental conditions in our markets and review of the results of various actuarial projections. Our aggregate carried loss reserves is the sum of our reserves for each accident year and represents our best estimate of outstanding loss reserves.\nThe amount by which estimated losses in the aggregate differ from those previously estimated for a specific time period is known as reserve development.\u201d Reserve development is unfavorable when losses ultimately settle for more than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims, causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be ''deficient.'' Reserve development is favorable when estimates of ultimate losses indicate a decrease in established reserves, causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be ''redundant.'' Development is reflected in our operating results through an adjustment to incurred losses and LAE during the period in which it is recognized.\nAlthough claims for which reserves are established may not be paid for several years or more, we do not discount loss reserves in our financial statements for the time value of money, in accordance with GAAP.\nThe three main components of our loss reserves are case reserves, incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss reserves, and LAE reserves.\nWhen claims are reported to us, we establish individual estimates of the ultimate cost of each claim (case reserves). These case reserves are continually monitored and revised in response to new information and for amounts paid.\nIBNR is an actuarial estimate of future payments on claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us. In addition to this provision for late reported claims, we also estimate and make a provision for the extent to which the case reserves on known claims may develop and for additional payments on closed claims, known as reopening.\u201d IBNR reserves apply to the entire body\nof claims arising from a specific time period, rather than a specific claim. Most of our IBNR reserves relate to estimated future claim payments on recorded open claims.\nLAE reserves are our estimate of the future expenses of investigating, administering, and settling claims that will be paid to manage claims that have occurred, including legal expenses. LAE reserves are established in the aggregate, rather than on a claim-by-claim basis. LAE reserves are categorized between defense and cost containment, and adjusting and other.\nA portion of our obligations for losses and LAE are ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers. The amount of reinsurance that will be recoverable on our losses and LAE includes both the reinsurance recoverable from our excess of loss reinsurance contracts, as well as reinsurance recoverable under the terms of the LPT Agreement.\nOur loss reserves (gross and net of reinsurance), including the main components of such reserves, were as follows:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Case reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,046.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,046.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IBNR\n</td> <td>937.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>991.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LAE reserves\n</td> <td>316.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross unpaid losses and LAE reserves\n</td> <td>2,301.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,347.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and LAE\n</td> <td>580.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>628.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unpaid losses and LAE reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,721.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,719.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use actuarial methods to analyze and estimate the aggregate amount of loss reserves. Management considers the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions, among other factors, in establishing loss reserves.\nJudgment is required in the actuarial estimation of loss reserves, including the selection of various actuarial methodologies to project the ultimate cost of claims. Specifically, judgment is required in the following areas: the selection of projection parameters based on historical company data; the use of industry data and other benchmarks; the identification and quantification of potential changes in parameters from historical levels to current and future levels due to changes in future claims development expectations; and the weighting of differing reserve indications resulting from alternative methods and assumptions. The adequacy of our ultimate loss reserves is inherently uncertain and represents a significant risk to our business. We attempt to mitigate this risk through our claims management processes and by monitoring and reacting to statistics relating to the cost and duration of claims.\nWe retain an independent actuarial consulting firm (Consulting Actuary) to perform comprehensive studies of our loss reserves on a semi-annual basis. The role of the Consulting Actuary is to conduct sufficient analyses to produce a range of reasonable estimates, as well as a point estimate, of our loss reserves, and to present those results to our Internal Actuary and to management as supplemental data in selecting management's best estimate of ultimate losses.\nOur Internal Actuary has been named as the \"Appointed Actuary\" for financial statement periods ending on or after December 31, 2015 and therefore all reserve figures shown as of and after December 31, 2015 are based on our internal actuarial analysis.\nWe compile and aggregate our claims data by grouping the claims according to the year in which the claim occurred ( accident year\u201d) when analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time. Additionally, claims data is aggregated and compiled separately for different types of claims, claimant benefits, or methods of claim closure and for different states, territories within states, or groups of states in which we do business.\nOur Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary prepare reserve estimates for all accident years using our own historical claims data, industry data and many of the generally accepted actuarial methodologies for estimating loss reserves, such as paid loss development methods, incurred loss development methods, and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. These methods vary in their responsiveness to different information, characteristics, and dynamics in the data, and the results assist the actuary in considering these characteristics and dynamics in the historical data. The methods employed for each segment of claims data, and the relative weight accorded to each method, vary depending on the nature of the claims segment and on the age of the claims.\nEach actuarial methodology requires the selection and application of various parameters and assumptions. The key parameters and assumptions include: the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time; the magnitude and changes in claim settlement activity, claims cost inflation rates; the effects of legislative benefit changes and/or judicial changes; and trends in the frequency of claims, both overall and by severity of claim. We believe the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or emerge over time, claim settlement activity, claims cost inflation rates, and claim frequencies are the most important parameters and assumptions.\nFor Nevada losses occurring in 2007 or prior, one method involves adjusting historical data for inflation. The inflation rates used in the analysis are judgmentally selected based on historical year-to-year movements in the cost of claims observed in our insurance\nsubsidiaries' data and industry-wide data, as well as on broader inflation indices. The results of this method would differ if different inflation rates were selected.\nIn projections using December 31, 2016 data, the method that uses explicit medical cost inflation assumptions included medical cost inflation factors ranging from 1.5% to 4.5%. The selection of medical cost inflation assumptions used has been based on observed recent and longer-term historical medical cost inflation in our claims data and in the U.S. economy more generally. The rate of medical cost inflation, as reflected in our historical medical payments per claim, has averaged approximately 3.0% over the past 15 years. The rate of medical cost inflation in the general U.S. economy, as measured by the consumer price index-medical care, has averaged approximately 3.6% over the past 15 years.\nManagement, along with our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary, separately analyze LAE and estimate unpaid LAE. These analyses rely primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amounts that have been spent on LAE historically, compared with the volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical calendar periods. The portion of unpaid LAE that will be recoverable from reinsurers is estimated based on the contractual reinsurance terms.\nThe ranges of estimates of loss reserves produced by our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary are intended to represent the range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses will fall. These ranges are narrower than the range of indications produced by the individual methods applied because it is not likely that the high or low result will emerge for every claim segment and accident year. Each actuary's point estimate of loss reserves is based on a judgmental selection for each claim segment from within the range of results indicated by the different actuarial methods.\nManagement formally establishes loss reserves for financial statement purposes on a quarterly basis. In doing so, we make reference to the most current analyses of our Internal Actuary and of the Consulting Actuary, including a review of the assumptions and the results of the various actuarial methods used. Comprehensive studies are conducted in the second and fourth quarters by both our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary. On the alternate quarters, the results of the preceding quarter's studies are updated for actual claim payment activity by our Internal Actuary.\nThe aggregate carried reserve calculated by management represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and LAE. In establishing management's best estimate of unpaid losses and LAE at December 31 for the last three years, management and our Internal Actuary reviewed and considered the following: (a) our Internal Actuary's and the Consulting Actuary's assumptions, point estimates, and ranges; (b) the inherent uncertainty of workers' compensation loss reserves; and (c) the potential for legislative and/or judicial reversal of California workers' compensation reforms. Management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each uncertainty, but rather established an overall provision that represented management's best estimate of loss reserves in light of the historical data, actuarial assumptions, point estimate and range, and current facts and circumstances.\nThe table below provides the actuarial range of loss reserves that management considered when selecting its best estimate and our carried reserves.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Low end of actuarial range\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,525.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,549.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carried reserves\n</td> <td>1,721.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,719.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>High end of actuarial range\n</td> <td>1,884.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,898.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, California and Nevada represented approximately 77% of our loss reserves on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn California, where our operations began in 2002, the actuaries' and management's initial expectations of ultimate losses and patterns of loss emergence and payment were based on benchmarks derived from analyses of historical insurance industry data in California. No historical data from our California insurance subsidiary existed prior to July 1, 2002; however, some historical data was available for the prior years for some of the market segments we entered in California, but was limited as to the number of loss reserve evaluation points available. The industry-based benchmarks were judgmentally adjusted for the anticipated impact of significant environmental changes, specifically the enactment of major changes to the statutory workers' compensation benefit structure and the manner in which claims are administered and adjudicated in California. The actual emergence and payment of claims by our California insurance subsidiary have been more favorable than those initial expectations through 2008, due in part to the impact of the enactment of major changes in the California workers' compensation environment. Our recent loss experience, from 2010 through 2016, indicates an upward trend in medical and indemnity costs that are reflected in our loss reserves; however, our indemnity claims frequency (the number of claims expressed as a percentage of payroll) decreased year-over-year for the past three years. Our reserve estimates assume that increasing medical cost trends will continue and will impact our long-term claims costs and loss reserves.\nIn Nevada, we have compiled a lengthy history of workers' compensation claims payment patterns based on the business of the Fund and EICN, but the emergence and payment of claims in recent years has been more favorable than in the long-term history in Nevada with the Fund. The expected patterns of claim payments and emergence used in the projection of our ultimate claim payments are based on both long and short-term historical data. In recent evaluations, claim patterns have continued to emerge in a manner consistent with short-term historical data. Consequently, our selection of claim projection patterns has relied more heavily on patterns observed in recent years.\nOur insurance subsidiaries have been operating in a period characterized by changing environmental conditions in our major markets, entry into new markets, and operational changes. During periods characterized by such changes, at each evaluation, the actuaries and management must make judgments as to the relative weight to accord to long-term historical and more recent company data, external data, evaluations of environmental and operational changes, and other factors in selecting the methods to use in projecting ultimate losses and LAE, the parameters to incorporate in those methods, and the relative weights to accord to the different projection indications. At each evaluation, management has given weight to new data, recent indications, and evaluations of environmental conditions and changes that implicitly reflect management's expectation as to the degree to which the future will resemble the most recent information and most recent changes, compared with long-term claim payment, claims emergence, and claim cost inflation patterns.\nWe have actively driven a significant increase in claims settlement activity beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2016, which has primarily affected accident years 2009 and forward, that is the result of an internal initiative that emphasizes the settlement of open claims. This settlement activity has been recognized in the actuarial analysis using a methodology developed to adjust the data and loss development patterns to account for the settlements arising from this initiative.\nMore than 60% of our claims payments during the three years ended December 31, 2016 related to medical care for injured workers. The utilization and cost of medical services in the future is a significant source of uncertainty in the establishment of loss reserves for workers' compensation. Our loss reserves are established based on reviewing the results of actuarial methods, some of which do not contain explicit medical claim cost inflation rates; however, because medical care may be provided to an injured worker over many years, and in some cases decades, the pace of medical claim cost inflation has a significant impact on our ultimate claim payments. For example, if the rate of medical claim cost inflation increases by 1% above the inflation rate that is implicitly included in the loss reserves at December 31, 2016, we estimate that future medical costs over the lifetime of current claims would increase by approximately $88 million on a net-of-reinsurance basis.\nThe range of estimates of loss reserves produced by our actuarial reviews of medical cost inflation data provide some indication of the potential variability of future losses and LAE payments; however, the full range of potential variation is difficult to estimate because our insurance subsidiaries do not have a lengthy operating history in many of the states in which we now operate. Our reserve estimates reflect expected increases in the costs of contested claims, but do not assume any losses resulting from significant new legal liability theories. Our reserve estimates also assume that there will not be significant future changes in the regulatory and legislative environment. In the event of significant new legal liability theories or new regulation or legislation, we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business.\nIf the actual loss reserves were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range, the impact on our financial results would have been as follows:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in reserves\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At low end of range\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(195.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(169.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At high end of range\n</td> <td>163.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in stockholders' equity and net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At low end of range\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At high end of range\n</td> <td>(106.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(116.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nActual losses are affected by a more complex combination of forces and dynamics than any one model or actuarial methodology can represent, and each methodology is an approximation of these complex forces and dynamics. None of the methods are designed or intended to produce an indication that is systematically higher or lower than the other methods. At any given evaluation date, some of the actuarial projection methods produce indications outside the actuary's selected range. Accordingly, we believe that the range of potential outcomes is considerably wider than the actuarially estimated range of the most likely outcomes. We have no basis for anticipating whether actual future payments of losses and LAE may be either greater than or less than the loss reserves currently on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAdditionally, any adjustment to the estimated ceded reserves under the LPT Agreement results in a cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, which is also included in losses and LAE incurred in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, so that the Deferred Gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the LPT Agreement. The table below provides the actuarial range of estimated liabilities for gross loss reserves under the LPT Agreement and our carried reserves.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Low end of actuarial range\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LPT carried reserves\n</td> <td>465.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>High end of actuarial range\n</td> <td>529.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf the actual gross loss reserves under the LPT Agreement were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range, the impact on our financial results, excluding the impact of the contingent profit commission, would have been as follows:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in reserves\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At low end of range\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(40.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At high end of range\n</td> <td>63.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in stockholders' equity and net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At low end of range\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At high end of range\n</td> <td>(41.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReinsurance Recoverables\nReinsurance recoverables represent: (a) amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and LAE; (b) amounts recoverable from reinsurers on estimates of reported losses; and (c) amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of IBNR for losses and LAE. These recoverables are based on our current estimates of the underlying loss reserves, and are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets separately as assets, as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders. We bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers, which can be significant considering that some of the loss reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time. Reinsurers may refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them, or they might delay payment. We are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement. We continually monitor the financial condition and financial strength ratings of our reinsurers. No material amounts due from reinsurers have been written-off as uncollectible since our inception in 2000, and we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment.\nUnder the LPT Agreement, the Fund initially ceded $1.5 billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and LAE related to claims incurred prior to July 1, 1995 for consideration of $775.0 million in cash. The estimated remaining liabilities subject to the LPT Agreement were $465.5 million as of December 31, 2016. Losses and LAE paid with respect to the LPT Agreement totaled $722.7 million at December 31, 2016. We account for the LPT Agreement as retroactive reinsurance. Entry into the LPT Agreement resulted in a deferred reinsurance gain that was recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as a liability. The Deferred Gain is being amortized using the recovery method, whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries through the life of the LPT Agreement, and the amortization is reflected in losses and LAE. Changes in estimates of the reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement may significantly impact the Deferred Gain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and losses and LAE in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nAdditionally, we are entitled to receive a contingent profit commission under the LPT Agreement. The contingent profit commission is an amount based on the favorable difference between actual paid losses and LAE and expected paid losses and LAE as established in the LPT Agreement. The calculation of actual amounts paid versus expected amounts is determined every five years beginning June 30, 2004 for the first twenty-five years of the agreement. We are paid 30% of the favorable difference between the actual and expected losses and LAE paid at each calculation point. Each quarter, management records its best estimate of the estimated ultimate contingent profit commission through June 30, 2024, which is impacted by estimates for ceded losses and LAE. The related Deferred Gain is amortized using the recovery method, whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries over the life of the contingent profit commission, or through June 30, 2024, and is recorded in losses and LAE incurred in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimates of the reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement may significantly impact the Contingent commission receivable-LPT Agreement and the Deferred Gain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and losses and LAE in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nRecognition of Premium Revenue\nPremium revenue is recognized as earned over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. At the end of the policy term, payroll-based premium audits are performed on substantially all policyholder accounts to determine net premiums earned for the policy year. Earned but unbilled premiums include estimated future audit premiums based on our historical experience. These estimates are subject to changes in policyholders' payrolls, economic conditions, and seasonality, and are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known. Any such adjustments are included in current operations; however, they are partially offset by the resulting changes in losses and LAE, commission expenses, and premium taxes. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, we believe that the net effect of any estimates currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process. Recognition (Step 1) occurs when we conclude that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step 2) is addressed only if Step 1 has been satisfied. Under Step 2, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce our provision for income taxes.\nValuation of Investments\nOur investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of deferred taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses resulting from sales of investments are recognized in operations on a specific-identification basis.\nWe use third party pricing services to assist us with our investment accounting function. The fair values of our available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, when available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level 1 or Level 2 inputs in accordance with GAAP guidance. The Company obtains a quoted price for each security from third party pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities. For securities not actively traded, the third party pricing services may use quoted market prices of similar instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, and prepayment speeds. The Company also performs quarterly analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value, including confirming the fair values of these securities through observable market prices using an alternative pricing source. If differences are noted in this review, the Company may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. (See Note 5 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nImpairment of Investment Securities. When, in the opinion of management, a decline in the fair value of an equity security below its cost is considered to be other-than-temporary,\u201d the equity security's cost is written down to its fair value at the time the other-than-temporary decline is identified. The determination of an other-than-temporary decline for debt securities includes, in addition to other relevant factors, a presumption that if the fair value is below cost by a significant amount for a period of time, a bifurcation of the write-down may be necessary. If management has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, the investment is written down to its fair value and the entire impairment is recorded as a realized loss due to credit in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. If management does not have the intent to sell or will not be required to sell the debt security but does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the debt security, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment is bifurcated between credit loss and other loss and recorded as a component of realized gains and losses and in other comprehensive income, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The amount of any write-down is determined by the difference between the cost or amortized cost of the debt security and its fair value at the time the other-than-temporary decline is identified.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe prepare an impairment analysis for goodwill and other intangible assets, whereby we identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events, such as cash flows and profitability. Differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) Number 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This update simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including income taxes and classification of awards on the balance sheet and on the statement of cash flows. We elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 with an effective date of January 1, 2016. Adoption of this standard had the following impacts on our consolidated financial statements:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income - This standard requires that the tax effects of stock-based compensation be recognized in the income tax expense. Net tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $1.4 million were recognized as a reduction to Income tax expense and an increase to Net income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2016. These changes increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This standard also requires that assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method be modified to exclude the excess tax benefits that would have been recognized in Additional paid-in capital. These changes were applied on a prospective basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows - This standard requires that the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation be reported as cash flows from operating activities rather than the previous requirement to present the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities. This update resulted in a change in presentation that was applied on a prospective basis and prior periods have not been adjusted.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> This standard allows us to make a policy election as to whether we will include an estimate of stock-based compensation awards expected to be forfeited or whether it will account for forfeitures as they occur. We elected to continue to estimate forfeitures in the computation of our stock-based compensation, consistent with previous guidance, and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFinally, this standard allows us to withhold an amount in excess of the supplemental rate from an employee's stock-based compensation for federal tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. It also clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee's behalf should be presented as cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This update related to tax withholding and presentation of cash flows had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards - Not Yet Adopted\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10). This update replaces the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (trading or available-for-sale) and requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net income. Additionally, this update eliminates the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost. It requires financial instruments to be measured at fair value using the exit price notion. Furthermore, this update clarifies that an evaluation of deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale securities is needed, in combination with an evaluation of other deferred tax assets, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This update will result in a reclassification adjustment, net of tax, to retained earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income, which will be determined based on the fair value of securities at the effective date of adoption.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update provides guidance on a new lessee model that includes the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet. Additionally, the update provides clarity on the definition of a lease and the distinction between finance and operating leases. Furthermore, the update requires certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures pertaining to the amounts recorded in the financial statements. This update becomes effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We have not yet estimated the full impact that the adoption will have on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This update replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments with a methodology that reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. This update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented net of an allowance for credit losses. Additionally, this update requires credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down, allowing an entity to also record reversals of credit losses in current period net income. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have not yet estimated the full impact that the adoption will have on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). This update provides guidance and clarification on eight specific cash flow issues due to diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The cash flow issues affected are debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interest in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have determined the adoption of this standard will have no material financial impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and statement of cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). This update provides guidance for the classification and presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. This update requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. It requires the disclosure of information about the nature of restrictions on its cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This update also requires the entity to disclose, on the face of the statement of cash flows or in the notes to the financial statements, any restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents disaggregated by the line item in which they appear within the statement of financial position. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have determined the adoption of this standard will have no material financial impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and statement of cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU Number 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This update clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops revenue standards to improve the common revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue as performance obligations are met, in order to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity is entitled to receive for those goods or services. The following steps are applied in the updated guidance: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within that annual reporting period. Insurance contracts are not within the scope of this updated guidance and we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.", "item_7_truncated": "Share Repurchases. On February 16, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $50.0 million of our common stock from February 22, 2016 through February 22, 2018 (the 2016 Program). We expect that shares of common stock may be purchased at prevailing market prices through a variety of methods, including open market or private transactions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and as determined by management. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and economic conditions. Repurchases under the 2016 Program may be commenced, modified, or suspended from time-to-time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2016, we had a remaining common stock repurchase authorization of $28.9 million under the 2016 Program. See Item 5, Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nLAE reserves are our estimate of the future expenses of investigating, administering, and settling claims that will be paid to manage claims that have occurred, including legal expenses. LAE reserves are established in the aggregate, rather than on a claim-by-claim basis. LAE reserves are categorized between defense and cost containment, and adjusting and other.\n\nWe also have a modest portfolio of equity securities, which we record at fair value. We strive to limit the exposure to equity price risk associated with equity securities by investing primarily in mid-to-large capitalization issuers and by diversifying our holdings across several industry sectors. Equity securities represented 7.5% of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2016.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Book Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tax Equivalent Yield\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasuries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>States and municipalities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>956.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgaged-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial mortgaged-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,552.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe analyze our calendar year loss and LAE ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and LAE from all periods, including development (whether\nWe target small businesses, as we believe that this market is traditionally characterized by fewer competitors, more attractive pricing, and stronger persistency when compared to the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry in general.

The increase in 2016 was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in final audit premiums and growth in new business premium, partially offset by lower levels of renewal premiums, year-over-year. The declines in renewal premiums in 2016, compared to 2015, were due to declines in the LA Area of California, partially offset by increases in states outside California, as well as territories outside of the LA Area of California. While overall renewal premiums were down slightly year-over-year, primarily driven by lower net rates, our policy unit retention rate increased in 2016. Gross premiums written in 2015 were relatively flat compared to 2014; however, certain strategic initiatives, including diversifying our risk exposure across our markets and non-renewing under-performing business, resulted in a decline in premiums in California, while we increased premiums in other states.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>686.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock options exercised\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vesting of restricted stock units, net of shares withheld to satisfy minimum tax withholding\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of common stock\n</td> <td>(21.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends to common stockholders\n</td> <td>(11.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income for the year\n</td> <td>106.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>686.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2014 included net premiums received of $673.7 million, and investment income received of $82.7 million.

During periods characterized by such changes, at each evaluation, the actuaries and management must make judgments as to the relative weight to accord to long-term historical and more recent company data, external data, evaluations of environmental and operational changes, and other factors in selecting the methods to use in projecting ultimate losses and LAE, the parameters to incorporate in those methods, and the relative weights to accord to the different projection indications. At each evaluation, management has given weight to new data, recent indications, and evaluations of environmental conditions and changes that implicitly reflect management's expectation as to the degree to which the future will resemble the most recent information and most recent changes, compared with long-term claim payment, claims emergence, and claim cost inflation patterns.\nUnderwriting and other operating expenses are those costs that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue, excluding commission. These expenses include premium taxes and certain other general expenses that vary with, and are primarily related to, producing new or renewal business. Other underwriting expenses include policyholder dividends, changes in estimates of future write-offs of premiums receivable, general administrative expenses such as salaries and benefits, rent, office supplies, depreciation, and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately. Policy acquisition costs are variable based on premiums earned. Other operating expenses are more fixed in nature and become a smaller percentage of net premiums earned as premiums increase.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1-Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased liabilities\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable(1)\n</td> <td>60.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unpaid losses and LAE reserves(2)(3)\n</td> <td>2,301.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>479.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,147.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,384.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>397.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>492.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,200.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we oversee all of our investment activities, we employ Conning as our independent investment manager.

The contingent profit commission is an amount based on the favorable difference between actual paid losses and LAE and expected paid losses and LAE as established in the LPT Agreement. The calculation of actual amounts paid versus expected amounts is determined every five years beginning June 30, 2004 for the first twenty-five years of the agreement. We are paid 30% of the favorable difference between the actual and expected losses and LAE paid at each calculation point. Each quarter, management records its best estimate of the estimated ultimate contingent profit commission through June 30, 2024, which is impacted by estimates for ceded losses and LAE. The related Deferred Gain is amortized using the recovery method, whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries over the life of the contingent profit commission, or through June 30, 2024, and is recorded in losses and LAE incurred in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimates of the reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement may significantly impact the Contingent commission receivable-LPT Agreement and the Deferred Gain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and losses and LAE in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nWe are a holding company and our ability to fund our operations is contingent upon existing capital and the ability of our insurance subsidiaries' to pay dividends up to the holding company. Payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws and regulations, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. We require cash to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, make interest and principal payments on any outstanding debt obligations, provide additional surplus to our insurance subsidiaries, and fund our operating expenses.\nValuation of Investments\nWe use third party pricing services to assist us with our investment accounting function. The fair values of our available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, when available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level 1 or Level 2 inputs in accordance with GAAP guidance. The Company obtains a quoted price for each security from third party pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities. For securities not actively traded, the third party pricing services may use quoted market prices of similar instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, and prepayment speeds. The Company also performs quarterly analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value, including confirming the fair values of these securities through observable market prices using an alternative pricing source. If differences are noted in this review, the Company may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOperating Subsidiaries' Liquidity\nReinsurance recoverables represent: (a) amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and LAE; (b) amounts recoverable from reinsurers on estimates of reported losses; and (c) amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of IBNR for losses and LAE. These recoverables are based on our current estimates of the underlying loss reserves, and are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets separately as assets, as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders. We bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers, which can be significant considering that some of the loss reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time. Reinsurers may refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them, or they might delay payment. We are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement. We continually monitor the financial condition and financial strength ratings of our reinsurers. No material amounts due from reinsurers have been written-off as uncollectible since our inception in 2000, and we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment.\nof claims arising from a specific time period, rather than a specific claim. Most of our IBNR reserves relate to estimated future claim payments on recorded open claims.\nAdditionally, any adjustment to the estimated ceded reserves under the LPT Agreement results in a cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, which is also included in losses and LAE incurred in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, so that the Deferred Gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the LPT Agreement. The table below provides the actuarial range of estimated liabilities for gross loss reserves under the LPT Agreement and our carried reserves.\nCommission expenses include direct commissions to our agents and brokers for the premiums that they produce for us, as well as incentive payments, other marketing costs, and fees. Some of our agency contracts contain incentive clauses, and the terms of those agency incentives are specific to individual contracts and vary as a result of agency performance.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10). This update replaces the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (trading or available-for-sale) and requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net income. Additionally, this update eliminates the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost. It requires financial instruments to be measured at fair value using the exit price notion. Furthermore, this update clarifies that an evaluation of deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale securities is needed, in combination with an evaluation of other deferred tax assets, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This update will result in a reclassification adjustment, net of tax, to retained earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income, which will be determined based on the fair value of securities at the effective date of adoption.\nOur current accident year loss estimates were 65.2%, 66.2%, and 73.6% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decreasing trend in our current accident year loss estimates reflects the impact of key business initiatives, including: accelerating the settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, underwrite, and price profitable classes of business across all of our markets. In addition, we have increased rates in the LA Area in California limiting our growth in that territory, while we continue to grow in other territories within and outside of California. The current accident year loss estimate for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the impact of $6.5 million in large losses recognized in the second quarter of 2016, which increased the current accident year loss estimate for the year.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2015 included net premiums received of $678.9 million, and investment income received of $84.9 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $427.7 million, underwriting and other operating expenses paid of $121.3 million, and commissions paid of $82.9 million.\nNet Premiums Written\nThe following noteworthy items were included in our 2016 results of operations: (1) favorable prior year accident year loss development of $18.4 million, including $17.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary business and $1.4 million of favorable development on our assigned risk business, which decreased our losses and LAE by the same amount; (2) favorable development in the estimated reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $3.1 million cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain and reduced our losses and LAE by the same amount (LPT Reserve Adjustment); and (3) an increase in the contingent commission receivable under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $1.8 million cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, and reduced our losses and LAE by the same amount (LPT Contingent Commission Adjustment). Collectively, these items increased our net income before taxes by $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nManagement, along with our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary, separately analyze LAE and estimate unpaid LAE. These analyses rely primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amounts that have been spent on LAE historically, compared with the volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical calendar periods. The portion of unpaid LAE that will be recoverable from reinsurers is estimated based on the contractual reinsurance terms.\nWe are a Nevada holding company. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to select, small businesses in low to medium hazard industries. Workers' compensation insurance is provided under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees' medical, disability, vocational rehabilitation, and/or death benefit costs for work-related injuries or illnesses. We provide workers' compensation insurance in 36 states and the District of Columbia, with a concentration in California, where over one-half of our business is generated. Our revenues are primarily comprised of net premiums earned, net investment income, and net realized gains on investments.\nNotes Payable. The surplus notes bear interest at a fixed rate of between 405 and 425 basis points in excess of the 90-day LIBOR per annum, payable quarterly. We may redeem the surplus notes at any time at their face value of $32.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The surplus notes mature in 2034.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This update replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments with a methodology that reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. This update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented net of an allowance for credit losses. Additionally, this update requires credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down, allowing an entity to also record reversals of credit losses in current period net income. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have not yet estimated the full impact that the adoption will have on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of deferred taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses resulting from sales of investments are recognized in operations on a specific-identification basis.\nThe following table shows the percentage change in our in-force premiums, policy count, average policy size, payroll exposure upon which our premiums are based, and net rate as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, overall, for California, where 56% of our premiums were generated, and for all other states, excluding California:\nImpairment of Investment Securities. When, in the opinion of management, a decline in the fair value of an equity security below its cost is considered to be other-than-temporary,\u201d the equity security's cost is written down to its fair value at the time the other-than-temporary decline is identified. The determination of an other-than-temporary decline for debt securities includes, in addition to other relevant factors, a presumption that if the fair value is below cost by a significant amount for a period of time, a bifurcation of the write-down may be necessary. If management has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, the investment is written down to its fair value and the entire impairment is recorded as a realized loss due to credit in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. If management does not have the intent to sell or will not be required to sell the debt security but does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the debt security, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment is bifurcated between credit loss and other loss and recorded as a component of realized gains and losses and in other comprehensive income, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The amount of any write-down is determined by the difference between the cost or amortized cost of the debt security and its fair value at the time the other-than-temporary decline is identified.\n (1) LPT Reserve Adjustments result in a cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, which is recognized in losses and LAE incurred on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, such that the Deferred Gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the LPT Agreement. (See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.) \nThe range of estimates of loss reserves produced by our actuarial reviews of medical cost inflation data provide some indication of the potential variability of future losses and LAE payments; however, the full range of potential variation is difficult to estimate because our insurance subsidiaries do not have a lengthy operating history in many of the states in which we now operate. Our reserve estimates reflect expected increases in the costs of contested claims, but do not assume any losses resulting from significant new legal liability theories. Our reserve estimates also assume that there will not be significant future changes in the regulatory and legislative environment. In the event of significant new legal liability theories or new regulation or legislation, we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business.\nIn Nevada, we have compiled a lengthy history of workers' compensation claims payment patterns based on the business of the Fund and EICN, but the emergence and payment of claims in recent years has been more favorable than in the long-term history in Nevada with the Fund. The expected patterns of claim payments and emergence used in the projection of our ultimate claim payments are based on both long and short-term historical data. In recent evaluations, claim patterns have continued to emerge in a manner consistent with short-term historical data. Consequently, our selection of claim projection patterns has relied more heavily on patterns observed in recent years.\nInvestments\n \u2022 Losses and LAE decreased 3% in 2016 and 5% in 2015, each compared to the previous year; \nA portion of our obligations for losses and LAE are ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers. The amount of reinsurance that will be recoverable on our losses and LAE includes both the reinsurance recoverable from our excess of loss reinsurance contracts, as well as reinsurance recoverable under the terms of the LPT Agreement.\nEach actuarial methodology requires the selection and application of various parameters and assumptions. The key parameters and assumptions include: the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time; the magnitude and changes in claim settlement activity, claims cost inflation rates; the effects of legislative benefit changes and/or judicial changes; and trends in the frequency of claims, both overall and by severity of claim. We believe the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or emerge over time, claim settlement activity, claims cost inflation rates, and claim frequencies are the most important parameters and assumptions.\nCapital Resources\nIncome tax expense was $34.0 million, $5.0 million, and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 24.2%, 5.0%, and 5.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. For 2016, tax-advantaged investment income, LPT Reserve Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory 35% rate by $15.3 million. For 2015, tax-advantaged investment income, pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory 35% rate by $29.8 million. For 2014, tax-advantaged investment income, pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory 35% rate by $31.4 million.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\n\n (1) Net rate, defined as total in-force premiums divided by total insured payroll exposure, is a function of a variety of factors, including rate changes, underwriting risk profiles and pricing, and changes in business mix related to economic and competitive pressures. \nFor Nevada losses occurring in 2007 or prior, one method involves adjusting historical data for inflation. The inflation rates used in the analysis are judgmentally selected based on historical year-to-year movements in the cost of claims observed in our insurance\n\nThe following noteworthy items were included in our 2014 results of operations: (1) favorable development in the estimated reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $31.1 million LPT Reserve Adjustment; (2) an increase in the contingent commission receivable under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $10.8 million LPT Contingent Commission Adjustment; and (3) a reallocation of $13.1 million of losses and LAE reserves from non-taxable periods prior to January 1, 2000, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.4 percentage points. Collectively, these items increased our net income before taxes by $41.9 million and decreased our income tax expense by $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn California, where our operations began in 2002, the actuaries' and management's initial expectations of ultimate losses and patterns of loss emergence and payment were based on benchmarks derived from analyses of historical insurance industry data in California. No historical data from our California insurance subsidiary existed prior to July 1, 2002; however, some historical data was available for the prior years for some of the market segments we entered in California, but was limited as to the number of loss reserve evaluation points available. The industry-based benchmarks were judgmentally adjusted for the anticipated impact of significant environmental changes, specifically the enactment of major changes to the statutory workers' compensation benefit structure and the manner in which claims are administered and adjudicated in California. The actual emergence and payment of claims by our California insurance subsidiary have been more favorable than those initial expectations through 2008, due in part to the impact of the enactment of major changes in the California workers' compensation environment. Our recent loss experience, from 2010 through 2016, indicates an upward trend in medical and indemnity costs that are reflected in our loss reserves; however, our indemnity claims frequency (the number of claims expressed as a percentage of payroll) decreased year-over-year for the past three years. Our reserve estimates assume that increasing medical cost trends will continue and will impact our long-term claims costs and loss reserves.\nWe prepare an impairment analysis for goodwill and other intangible assets, whereby we identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events, such as cash flows and profitability. Differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results.\nOn January 1, 2000, EICN assumed the assets, liabilities, and operations of the Fund pursuant to legislation passed in the 1999 Nevada Legislature (the Privatization). Prior to the Privatization, the Fund was part of the State of Nevada and therefore was not subject to federal income tax. Accordingly, our pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments and Deferred Gain amortization impact our net income but do not change our taxable income.\n (1) Notes payable includes payments of the principal and estimated interest expense on our surplus notes outstanding based on LIBOR plus a margin. The interest rates used ranged from 4.9% to 5.1%. \n\nThe calendar year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and LAE incurred during the calendar year, regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred, by the net premiums earned during that calendar year. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and LAE established for insured events occurring in the current and prior years. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods.\nThe table below provides the actuarial range of loss reserves that management considered when selecting its best estimate and our carried reserves.\nIn projections using December 31, 2016 data, the method that uses explicit medical cost inflation assumptions included medical cost inflation factors ranging from 1.5% to 4.5%. The selection of medical cost inflation assumptions used has been based on observed recent and longer-term historical medical cost inflation in our claims data and in the U.S. economy more generally. The rate of medical cost inflation, as reflected in our historical medical payments per claim, has averaged approximately 3.0% over the past 15 years. The rate of medical cost inflation in the general U.S. economy, as measured by the consumer price index-medical care, has averaged approximately 3.6% over the past 15 years.\nFinancing Activities\nWhen claims are reported to us, we establish individual estimates of the ultimate cost of each claim (case reserves). These case reserves are continually monitored and revised in response to new information and for amounts paid.\nOur indemnity claims frequency (the number of claims expressed as a percentage of payroll) continued to decrease year-over-year in 2016 and 2015; however, our loss experience indicates a slight upward movement in medical and indemnity costs per claim that are reflected in our current accident year loss estimates. In California, we experienced increased costs per claim associated with an increase in the number of cumulative trauma claims filed during 2015, compared to 2014. Total claims costs have also been reduced by cost savings associated with increased claims settlement activity beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2016. We believe our current accident year loss estimate is adequate; however, ultimate losses will not be known with any certainty for many years. We assume that increasing medical and indemnity cost trends will continue to impact our long-term claims costs and current accident year loss estimate, which may be offset by rate increases. Additional information regarding our reserves for losses and LAE is set forth under -Critical Accounting Policies-Reserves for Losses and LAE.\u201d\nCommission Expense Ratio.\n (2) LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments result in a cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, which is recognized in losses and LAE incurred on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, such that the Deferred Gain reflects the balance that would have \nNet cash used in investing activities in 2016, 2015, and 2014 was primarily related to the investment of premiums received and the reinvestment of funds from maturities, redemptions, and interest income. These investing cash outflows were partially offset by investment sales whose proceeds were used to fund claims payments, underwriting and other operating expenses, common stock dividend payments, and common stock repurchases.\nResults of Operations\nTotal cash and investments held by our operating subsidiaries was $2,560.5 million at December 31, 2016, consisting of $23.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $16.0 million of short-term investments, $2,328.4 million of fixed maturity securities and $192.2 million of equity securities. Sources of immediate and unencumbered liquidity at our operating subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 consisted of $20.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, $142.0 million of publicly-traded equity securities whose proceeds are available within four business days, and $1.3 billion of highly liquid fixed maturity securities whose proceeds are available within four business days. We believe that our subsidiaries' liquidity needs over the next 24 months will be met with cash from operations, investment income, and maturing investments.\nThe ranges of estimates of loss reserves produced by our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary are intended to represent the range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses will fall. These ranges are narrower than the range of indications produced by the individual methods applied because it is not likely that the high or low result will emerge for every claim segment and accident year. Each actuary's point estimate of loss reserves is based on a judgmental selection for each claim segment from within the range of results indicated by the different actuarial methods.\nFor additional information regarding our investments, including the cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and estimated fair value of our investments, the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities by contractual maturity, and net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) on fixed maturity and equity securities, see Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nVarious state laws and regulations require us to hold investment securities or letters of credit on deposit with certain states in which we do business. Securities having a fair value of $1,009.7 million and $881.2 million were on deposit at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These laws and regulations govern both the amount and types of investment securities that are eligible for deposit. Additionally, certain reinsurance contracts require company funds to be held in trust for the benefit of the ceding reinsurer to secure the outstanding liabilities we assumed. The fair value of fixed maturity securities held in trust for the benefit of our ceding reinsurers was $27.2 million and $32.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe following outlines each component of our total capital resources:\nNet investment income was $73.2 million, $72.2 million, and $72.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The average pre-tax book yield on our invested assets was 3.1%, 3.2%, and 3.2% at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The average tax-equivalent yield on our invested assets, which adjusts the book yield of our investments in tax-advantaged securities to an equivalent pre-tax book yield, was 3.6%, 3.8%, and 3.8% as of the same dates, respectively.\nNet premiums earned were $694.8 million, $690.4 million, and $684.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Net premiums earned are primarily a function of the amount and timing of net premiums previously written.\nThe amount by which estimated losses in the aggregate differ from those previously estimated for a specific time period is known as reserve development.\u201d Reserve development is unfavorable when losses ultimately settle for more than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims, causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be ''deficient.'' Reserve development is favorable when estimates of ultimate losses indicate a decrease in established reserves, causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be ''redundant.'' Development is reflected in our operating results through an adjustment to incurred losses and LAE during the period in which it is recognized.\nThe following noteworthy items were included in our 2015 results of operations: (1) favorable prior year accident year loss development of $7.2 million, including $9.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary business, partially offset by $1.8 million of unfavorable development on our assigned risk business, which decreased our losses and LAE by the same amount; (2) favorable development in the estimated reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement that resulted in a $6.4 million LPT Reserve Adjustment; (3) an increase in the contingent commission receivable under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $2.6 million LPT Contingent Commission Adjustment; and (4) a reallocation of $56.3 million of losses and LAE reserves from non-taxable periods prior to January 1, 2000, which reduced our effective tax rate by 15.4 percentage points. Collectively, these items increased our net income before taxes by $16.2 million and decreased our income tax expense by $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nManagement formally establishes loss reserves for financial statement purposes on a quarterly basis. In doing so, we make reference to the most current analyses of our Internal Actuary and of the Consulting Actuary, including a review of the assumptions and the results of the various actuarial methods used. Comprehensive studies are conducted in the second and fourth quarters by both our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary. On the alternate quarters, the results of the preceding quarter's studies are updated for actual claim payment activity by our Internal Actuary.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update provides guidance on a new lessee model that includes the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet. Additionally, the update provides clarity on the definition of a lease and the distinction between finance and operating leases. Furthermore, the update requires certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures pertaining to the amounts recorded in the financial statements. This update becomes effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We have not yet estimated the full impact that the adoption will have on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting for workers' compensation insurance requires us to estimate the liability for the expected ultimate cost of unpaid losses and LAE (loss reserves) as of a balance sheet date. Loss reserve estimates are inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount we pay for many of the claims we have incurred as of the balance sheet date will not be known for many years. Our estimate of loss reserves is intended to equal the difference between the expected ultimate losses and LAE of all claims that have occurred as of a balance sheet date and amounts already paid. We establish loss reserves based on our own analysis of emerging claims experience and environmental conditions in our markets and review of the results of various actuarial projections. Our aggregate carried loss reserves is the sum of our reserves for each accident year and represents our best estimate of outstanding loss reserves.\nThe aggregate carried reserve calculated by management represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and LAE. In establishing management's best estimate of unpaid losses and LAE at December 31 for the last three years, management and our Internal Actuary reviewed and considered the following: (a) our Internal Actuary's and the Consulting Actuary's assumptions, point estimates, and ranges; (b) the inherent uncertainty of workers' compensation loss reserves; and (c) the potential for legislative and/or judicial reversal of California workers' compensation reforms. Management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each uncertainty, but rather established an overall provision that represented management's best estimate of loss reserves in light of the historical data, actuarial assumptions, point estimate and range, and current facts and circumstances.\nWe invest in fixed maturity securities, equity securities, short-term investments, and cash equivalents. Net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities, less bank service charges and custodial and portfolio management fees. We have established a high quality/short duration bias in our investment portfolio.\nThe comparative components of net income are set forth in the following table:\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes thereto, and the financial statement schedules included in Item 8 and Item 15 of this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors described in Item 1A of this report. Our actual results in future periods may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including the risks described in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d elsewhere in this report.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our investment portfolio, which is classified as available-for-sale, consisted of 91.9% fixed maturity securities. We strive to limit the interest rate risk associated with fixed maturity investments by managing the duration of these securities. Our fixed maturity securities (excluding cash and cash equivalents) had a duration of 4.3 years at December 31, 2016. To minimize interest rate risk, our portfolio is weighted toward short-term and intermediate-term bonds; however, our investment strategy balances consideration of duration, yield, and credit risk. Our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio be AA-,\u201d using ratings assigned by S&P. Our fixed maturity securities portfolio had a weighted average quality of AA-\u201d as of December 31, 2016, with 57.2% of the portfolio rated AA\u201d or better, based on market value.\n \u2022 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income - This standard requires that the tax effects of stock-based compensation be recognized in the income tax expense. Net tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $1.4 million were recognized as a reduction to Income tax expense and an increase to Net income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2016. These changes increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This standard also requires that assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method be modified to exclude the excess tax benefits that would have been recognized in Additional paid-in capital. These changes were applied on a prospective basis. \nInvestments that we currently own could be subject to default by the issuer or could suffer declines in fair value that become other-than-temporary. We regularly assess individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management, including the identification of other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Our other-than-temporary impairment assessment includes reviewing the extent and duration of declines in fair value of investments below amortized cost, historical and projected financial performance and near-term prospects of the issuer, the outlook for industry sectors, credit rating, and macro-economic changes. We also make a\nOur commission expense ratio was 12.0%, 12.4%, and 11.9%, and our commission expenses were $83.5 million, $85.4 million, and $81.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in our commission expense ratio in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to lower agency incentives. The increase in the commission expense ratio in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to higher agency incentives.\nIf the actual loss reserves were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range, the impact on our financial results would have been as follows:\nThe primary sources of cash for our insurance operating subsidiaries are premium collections, investment income, sales and maturities of investments and reinsurance recoveries. The primary uses of cash for our insurance subsidiaries are payments of losses and LAE, commission expenses, underwriting and other operating expenses, ceded reinsurance, investment purchases and dividends paid to their parent.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2016 included net premiums received of $694.9 million, and investment income received of $87.8 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $433.7 million, underwriting and other operating expenses paid of $125.8 million, and commissions paid of $84.2 million.\nWe retain an independent actuarial consulting firm (Consulting Actuary) to perform comprehensive studies of our loss reserves on a semi-annual basis. The role of the Consulting Actuary is to conduct sufficient analyses to produce a range of reasonable estimates, as well as a point estimate, of our loss reserves, and to present those results to our Internal Actuary and to management as supplemental data in selecting management's best estimate of ultimate losses.\nJudgment is required in the actuarial estimation of loss reserves, including the selection of various actuarial methodologies to project the ultimate cost of claims. Specifically, judgment is required in the following areas: the selection of projection parameters based on historical company data; the use of industry data and other benchmarks; the identification and quantification of potential changes in parameters from historical levels to current and future levels due to changes in future claims development expectations; and the weighting of differing reserve indications resulting from alternative methods and assumptions. The adequacy of our ultimate loss reserves is inherently uncertain and represents a significant risk to our business. We attempt to mitigate this risk through our claims management processes and by monitoring and reacting to statistics relating to the cost and duration of claims.\nBoth the payment of interest and repayment of the surplus notes are subject to the prior approval of the Florida Department of Financial Services.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU Number 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This update clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops revenue standards to improve the common revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue as performance obligations are met, in order to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity is entitled to receive for those goods or services. The following steps are applied in the updated guidance: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within that annual reporting period. Insurance contracts are not within the scope of this updated guidance and we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary prepare reserve estimates for all accident years using our own historical claims data, industry data and many of the generally accepted actuarial methodologies for estimating loss reserves, such as paid loss development methods, incurred loss development methods, and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. These methods vary in their responsiveness to different information, characteristics, and dynamics in the data, and the results assist the actuary in considering these characteristics and dynamics in the historical data. The methods employed for each segment of claims data, and the relative weight accorded to each method, vary depending on the nature of the claims segment and on the age of the claims.\nIncome Taxes\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards - Not Yet Adopted\nOther Income\nTotal cash and investments at the holding company were $57.3 million at December 31, 2016, consisting of $41.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $16.0 million of fixed maturity securities. We do not currently have a revolving credit facility because\n\n\nA primary measure of our performance is our ability to increase Adjusted stockholders' equity over the long-term. We believe that this measure is important to our investors, analysts, and other interested parties who benefit from having an objective and consistent basis for comparison with other companies within our industry. The following table shows a reconciliation of our stockholders' equity on a GAAP basis to our Adjusted stockholders' equity.\n (3) We define net income before impact of the LPT Agreement as net income before the impact of: (a) amortization of the Deferred Gain; (b) adjustments to the LPT Agreement ceded reserves; and (c) adjustments to the Contingent commission receivable -LPT Agreement. The Deferred Gain reflects the unamortized gain from the LPT Agreement. Under GAAP, this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method in which amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries over the life of the LPT Agreement, except for the contingent profit commission, which is amortized through June 30, 2024. The amortization is reflected in losses and LAE. We periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the LPT Agreement and the expected losses and LAE subject to the contingent profit commission under the LPT Agreement. Our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments, if needed, to reserves, ceded reserves, contingent commission receivable, and the Deferred Gain, with the net effect being an increase or decrease to our net income. Net income before impact of the LPT Agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, but rather reflects the difference in accounting treatment between statutory and GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income before income taxes or net income, or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP.  We present net income before impact of the LPT Agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of our ongoing operating performance to be used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating us. The LPT Agreement was a non-recurring transaction, under which the Deferred Gain does not affect our ongoing operations, and, consequently, we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance. In addition, we believe this non-GAAP measure, as we have defined it, is helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the excluded item has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations.\nFor additional information regarding our income tax expense see Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Tax Expense\nExcluding the impact from the LPT Agreement, losses and LAE would have been $434.5 million, $449.8 million, and $508.4 million, or 62.5%, 65.2%, and 74.3% of net premiums earned, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\n\nWe believe that we have appropriately identified the declines in the fair values of our unrealized losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. We determined that the unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily the result of prevailing interest rates and not the credit quality of the issuers. The fixed maturity securities whose fair value was less than amortized cost were not determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired given the lack of severity and duration of the impairment, the credit quality of the issuers, the Company's intent to not sell the securities, and a determination that it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities until fair value recovers to above cost, or principal value upon maturity.\nStockholders' Equity. The following table summarizes our beginning and ending stockholders' equity balance and the changes thereto for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\nOur underwriting results have improved over the past several years, which reflects the increased pricing flexibility afforded to us through the use of multiple writing companies within a state and territorial pricing in California. In addition, our ongoing underwriting initiatives, which are described below, have allowed us to expand our operations while also focusing on under-performing classes of business, as needed.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. Our accounting policies are described in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, but we believe that the following matters are particularly important to understand our financial statements because changes in these estimates or changes in the assumptions used to make them could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur loss reserves (gross and net of reinsurance), including the main components of such reserves, were as follows:\nThe following table shows the percentage of total estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2016 by credit rating category, using the lower of ratings assigned by Moody's Investors Service and/or S&P.\n \u2022 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows - This standard requires that the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation be reported as cash flows from operating activities rather than the previous requirement to present the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities. This update resulted in a change in presentation that was applied on a prospective basis and prior periods have not been adjusted.  This standard allows us to make a policy election as to whether we will include an estimate of stock-based compensation awards expected to be forfeited or whether it will account for forfeitures as they occur. We elected to continue to estimate forfeitures in the computation of our stock-based compensation, consistent with previous guidance, and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nLosses and LAE, Commission Expenses, and Underwriting and Other Operating Expenses\nOther income consists of net gains on fixed assets, non-investment interest, and other miscellaneous income. Other income was $0.6 million, $0.2 million, and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nFinally, this standard allows us to withhold an amount in excess of the supplemental rate from an employee's stock-based compensation for federal tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. It also clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee's behalf should be presented as cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This update related to tax withholding and presentation of cash flows had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the capital resources available to us consisted of: (i) $32.0 million of notes payable consisting of surplus notes maturing in 2034; (ii) $840.6 million of stockholders' equity; and (iii) the $174.9 million Deferred Gain.\n\n (3) The unpaid losses and LAE reserves are presented gross of reinsurance recoverables for unpaid losses, which were as follows for each of the periods presented above: \nOverall, losses and LAE were $417.9 million, $429.4 million, and $453.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in our losses and LAE from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to $18.4 million of net favorable prior accident year loss development in 2016 (versus $7.2 million of net favorable development in 2015), which included $17.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary risk business and $1.4 million of favorable development related to our assigned risk business. The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily related to $7.2 million of net favorable prior accident year loss development (versus $4.6 million of net unfavorable development in 2014), which included $9.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary risk business in 2015, which was partially offset by $1.8 million of unfavorable loss development related to our assigned risk business, and a decrease in the current accident year loss estimate. The favorable prior accident year loss development in 2016 and 2015 was the result of our determination that adjustments were necessary to reflect observed favorable paid loss trends in each of these years. Paid loss trends have been impacted by cost savings associated with accelerated claims settlement activity that began in 2014 and continued through 2016. The unfavorable prior accident year loss development in 2014 was primarily related to our assigned risk business. Additionally, there were favorable LPT Reserve Adjustments of $3.1 million, $6.4 million, and $31.1 million that decreased losses and LAE by those amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nThe three main components of our loss reserves are case reserves, incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss reserves, and LAE reserves.\nActual losses are affected by a more complex combination of forces and dynamics than any one model or actuarial methodology can represent, and each methodology is an approximation of these complex forces and dynamics. None of the methods are designed or intended to produce an indication that is systematically higher or lower than the other methods. At any given evaluation date, some of the actuarial projection methods produce indications outside the actuary's selected range. Accordingly, we believe that the range of potential outcomes is considerably wider than the actuarially estimated range of the most likely outcomes. We have no basis for anticipating whether actual future payments of losses and LAE may be either greater than or less than the loss reserves currently on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe recognized impairments of $5.8 million (consisting of 37 equity securities), $17.2 million (consisting of 27 equity securities), and $0.5 million (consisting of seven equity securities) during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The other-than temporary impairments recognized during these years related to equity securities were the result of the Company's intent to sell and/or the severity and duration of the change in fair values of these securities, primarily due to the downturn in the energy sector that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Certain unrealized losses on equity securities were not considered to be other-than-temporary due to the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers, and our intent to hold the securities until fair value recovers to above cost.\n\nReserves for Losses and LAE\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nPremium revenue is recognized as earned over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. At the end of the policy term, payroll-based premium audits are performed on substantially all policyholder accounts to determine net premiums earned for the policy year. Earned but unbilled premiums include estimated future audit premiums based on our historical experience. These estimates are subject to changes in policyholders' payrolls, economic conditions, and seasonality, and are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known. Any such adjustments are included in current operations; however, they are partially offset by the resulting changes in losses and LAE, commission expenses, and premium taxes. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, we believe that the net effect of any estimates currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment.\nfavorable or unfavorable) of reserves established in prior periods. In contrast, we analyze our accident year loss and LAE ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and LAE from insured events occurring during that year. The loss and LAE ratios provided in this report are calendar year basis, except where they are expressly identified as accident year loss and LAE ratios.\nsubsidiaries' data and industry-wide data, as well as on broader inflation indices. The results of this method would differ if different inflation rates were selected.\nRealized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Realized gains and losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original or adjusted cost (equity securities) or amortized cost (fixed maturity securities). Realized losses are also recognized when securities are written down as a result of an other-than-temporary impairment.\nstrategies.\nWe purchase reinsurance to protect us against the costs of severe claims and catastrophic events. On July 1, 2016, we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through June 30, 2017. The reinsurance program consists of one treaty covering excess of loss and catastrophic loss events in four layers of coverage. Our reinsurance coverage is $190.0 million in excess of our $10.0 million retention on a per occurrence basis, subject to certain exclusions. We believe that our excess of loss reinsurance program currently meets our needs.\nNew Accounting Standards\nThe following table shows the estimated fair value, the percentage of the fair value to total invested assets, the average book yield, and the average tax equivalent yield (each based on the fair value of each category of invested assets) as of December 31, 2016.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce our provision for income taxes.\nDividends. Dividends paid to stockholders were $11.5 million, $7.7 million, and $7.6 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends to common stockholders will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial position, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, legal and regulatory requirements, and any other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. On February 22, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a $0.15 dividend per share, payable March 22, 2017, to stockholders of record on March 8, 2017.\nNet realized gains (losses) on investments were $11.2 million, $(10.7) million, and $16.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Net realized gains on investments in 2016 were primarily the result of the sale of equity securities as part of a re-balancing of our equity investments portfolio to meet cash needs at the holding company, and to provide cash to support the internal restructuring of our insurance subsidiaries. Those gains were partially offset by $5.8 million in other-than-temporary impairments of certain equity securities due to our intent to sell securities, and the downturn in the energy sector during that year. Net realized losses on investments in 2015 were primarily the result of other-than-temporary impairments of certain equity securities during the fourth quarter due to the downturn in the energy sector during that year. The net realized gains on investments for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to a re-balancing of our equity investment portfolio. Additional information regarding our Investments is set forth under -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Investments\u201d and Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur investment portfolio is structured to support our need for: (i) optimizing our risk-adjusted total return; (ii) providing adequate liquidity; (iii) facilitating financial strength and stability; and (iv) ensuring regulatory and legal compliance.\nInvesting Activities\nHolding Company Liquidity\nThe table below reflects losses and LAE reserve adjustments and the impact of the LPT on net income before taxes.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis. Surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets. The amount of capital in our insurance subsidiaries is maintained relative to standardized capital adequacy measures such as risk-based capital (RBC), as established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The RBC standard was designed to provide a measure by which regulators can assess the adequacy of an insurance company's capital and surplus relative to its operations. An insurance company must maintain capital and surplus of at least 200% of RBC. Each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the minimum RBC requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action at December 31, 2016.\nReinsurance Recoverables\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). This update provides guidance for the classification and presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. This update requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. It requires the disclosure of information about the nature of restrictions on its cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This update also requires the entity to disclose, on the face of the statement of cash flows or in the notes to the financial statements, any restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents disaggregated by the line item in which they appear within the statement of financial position. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have determined the adoption of this standard will have no material financial impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and statement of cash flows.\n \u2022 Underwriting and other operating expenses increased 1% in 2016 and 5% in 2015, each compared to the previous year; \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the total amortized cost of our investment portfolio was $2.4 billion and its fair value was $2.6 billion. These investments provide a source of income, which may fluctuate with changes in interest rates and our current investment\nOur insurance subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to their parent is based on reported capital, surplus, and dividends paid within the last 12 months. For 2017, EICN and EPIC cannot pay any dividends without prior regulatory approval; ECIC can pay $4.6 million of dividends through June 21, 2017 and $38.1 million thereafter without prior regulatory approval, provided that no dividends are paid prior to June 21, 2017; and EAC can pay $18.0 million of dividends beginning July 6, 2017 without prior regulatory approval.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIf the actual gross loss reserves under the LPT Agreement were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range, the impact on our financial results, excluding the impact of the contingent profit commission, would have been as follows:\nMore than 60% of our claims payments during the three years ended December 31, 2016 related to medical care for injured workers. The utilization and cost of medical services in the future is a significant source of uncertainty in the establishment of loss reserves for workers' compensation. Our loss reserves are established based on reviewing the results of actuarial methods, some of which do not contain explicit medical claim cost inflation rates; however, because medical care may be provided to an injured worker over many years, and in some cases decades, the pace of medical claim cost inflation has a significant impact on our ultimate claim payments. For example, if the rate of medical claim cost inflation increases by 1% above the inflation rate that is implicitly included in the loss reserves at December 31, 2016, we estimate that future medical costs over the lifetime of current claims would increase by approximately $88 million on a net-of-reinsurance basis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIBNR is an actuarial estimate of future payments on claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us. In addition to this provision for late reported claims, we also estimate and make a provision for the extent to which the case reserves on known claims may develop and for additional payments on closed claims, known as reopening.\u201d IBNR reserves apply to the entire body\nOur Internal Actuary has been named as the \"Appointed Actuary\" for financial statement periods ending on or after December 31, 2015 and therefore all reserve figures shown as of and after December 31, 2015 are based on our internal actuarial analysis.\nThe following table presents our calendar year combined ratios.\n\n \u2022 Income tax expense was $34.0 million, $5.0 million, and $5.9 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  We continue to execute a number of ongoing business initiatives, including: focusing on internal and customer-facing business process excellence; accelerating the settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; utilizing a multi-company pricing platform; utilizing territory-specific pricing; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, price, and underwrite profitable classes of business across all of our markets.\nNet premiums written were $694.6 million, $689.3 million, and $687.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, which included $6.8 million, $8.4 million, and $10.1 million of reinsurance premiums ceded, respectively. The decreases in reinsurance premiums ceded from 2014 to 2016 reflect the increases in our retention on a per occurrence basis under our current excess of loss reinsurance program compared to earlier periods.\nWe compile and aggregate our claims data by grouping the claims according to the year in which the claim occurred ( accident year\u201d) when analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time. Additionally, claims data is aggregated and compiled separately for different types of claims, claimant benefits, or methods of claim closure and for different states, territories within states, or groups of states in which we do business.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). This update provides guidance and clarification on eight specific cash flow issues due to diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The cash flow issues affected are debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interest in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have determined the adoption of this standard will have no material financial impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and statement of cash flows.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2015 and 2014 included payments of dividends to common stockholders and repayment of notes payable and capital leases. These financing cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from stock-based compensation, mainly proceeds and income tax benefits from exercises of stock options.\nGross Premiums Written\nWe believe that our current asset allocation meets our strategy to preserve capital for claims and policy liabilities and to provide sufficient capital resources to support and grow our ongoing insurance operations.\nWe use actuarial methods to analyze and estimate the aggregate amount of loss reserves. Management considers the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions, among other factors, in establishing loss reserves.\nexisted had the revised contingent profit commission been recognized at the inception of the LPT Agreement. (See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nRecognition of Premium Revenue\nThe table below shows our net cash flows. For additional information regarding our cash flows, see Item 8, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nEach of our insurance subsidiaries became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) in January 2016. Membership allows our subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support and enhance liquidity management. The amount of advances that may be taken is dependent on statutory admitted assets on a per company basis. Currently, none of our subsidiaries has advances outstanding under the FHLB facility.\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments\nLosses and LAE represents our largest expense item and includes claim payments made, amortization of the Deferred Gain, LPT Reserve Adjustments, LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments, estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods, and costs associated with investigating, defending, and adjusting claims. The quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and LAE, which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques.\nOverview\n\n", "item_7_text": "Share Repurchases. On February 16, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $50.0 million of our common stock from February 22, 2016 through February 22, 2018 (the 2016 Program). We expect that shares of common stock may be purchased at prevailing market prices through a variety of methods, including open market or private transactions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and as determined by management. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and economic conditions. Repurchases under the 2016 Program may be commenced, modified, or suspended from time-to-time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2016, we had a remaining common stock repurchase authorization of $28.9 million under the 2016 Program. See Item 5, Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nLAE reserves are our estimate of the future expenses of investigating, administering, and settling claims that will be paid to manage claims that have occurred, including legal expenses. LAE reserves are established in the aggregate, rather than on a claim-by-claim basis. LAE reserves are categorized between defense and cost containment, and adjusting and other.\n\nWe also have a modest portfolio of equity securities, which we record at fair value. We strive to limit the exposure to equity price risk associated with equity securities by investing primarily in mid-to-large capitalization issuers and by diversifying our holdings across several industry sectors. Equity securities represented 7.5% of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2016.\nWe analyze our calendar year loss and LAE ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and LAE from all periods, including development (whether\nWe target small businesses, as we believe that this market is traditionally characterized by fewer competitors, more attractive pricing, and stronger persistency when compared to the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry in general. We believe we are able to price our policies at levels that are competitive and profitable over the long-term given our expertise in underwriting this market segment. Our underwriting approach is to consistently underwrite small business accounts at appropriate and competitive prices without sacrificing long-term profitability and stability for short-term top-line revenue growth.\ndetermination as to whether it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its fair value recovers above cost, or maturity.\nUnlike many other insurance companies, we include all of the operating expenses of our holding company in the calculation of our combined ratio, which served to increase our combined ratios by two percentage points in each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nUnder the LPT Agreement, the Fund initially ceded $1.5 billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and LAE related to claims incurred prior to July 1, 1995 for consideration of $775.0 million in cash. The estimated remaining liabilities subject to the LPT Agreement were $465.5 million as of December 31, 2016. Losses and LAE paid with respect to the LPT Agreement totaled $722.7 million at December 31, 2016. We account for the LPT Agreement as retroactive reinsurance. Entry into the LPT Agreement resulted in a deferred reinsurance gain that was recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as a liability. The Deferred Gain is being amortized using the recovery method, whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries through the life of the LPT Agreement, and the amortization is reflected in losses and LAE. Changes in estimates of the reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement may significantly impact the Deferred Gain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and losses and LAE in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nGross premiums written were $701.4 million, $697.7 million, and $697.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in final audit premiums and growth in new business premium, partially offset by lower levels of renewal premiums, year-over-year. The declines in renewal premiums in 2016, compared to 2015, were due to declines in the LA Area of California, partially offset by increases in states outside California, as well as territories outside of the LA Area of California. While overall renewal premiums were down slightly year-over-year, primarily driven by lower net rates, our policy unit retention rate increased in 2016. Gross premiums written in 2015 were relatively flat compared to 2014; however, certain strategic initiatives, including diversifying our risk exposure across our markets and non-renewing under-performing business, resulted in a decline in premiums in California, while we increased premiums in other states.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2014 included net premiums received of $673.7 million, and investment income received of $82.7 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $386.6 million, underwriting and other operating expenses paid of $122.6 million, and commissions paid of $78.9 million.\nAlthough claims for which reserves are established may not be paid for several years or more, we do not discount loss reserves in our financial statements for the time value of money, in accordance with GAAP.\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) Number 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This update simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including income taxes and classification of awards on the balance sheet and on the statement of cash flows. We elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 with an effective date of January 1, 2016. Adoption of this standard had the following impacts on our consolidated financial statements:\nOur insurance subsidiaries have been operating in a period characterized by changing environmental conditions in our major markets, entry into new markets, and operational changes. During periods characterized by such changes, at each evaluation, the actuaries and management must make judgments as to the relative weight to accord to long-term historical and more recent company data, external data, evaluations of environmental and operational changes, and other factors in selecting the methods to use in projecting ultimate losses and LAE, the parameters to incorporate in those methods, and the relative weights to accord to the different projection indications. At each evaluation, management has given weight to new data, recent indications, and evaluations of environmental conditions and changes that implicitly reflect management's expectation as to the degree to which the future will resemble the most recent information and most recent changes, compared with long-term claim payment, claims emergence, and claim cost inflation patterns.\nUnderwriting and other operating expenses are those costs that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue, excluding commission. These expenses include premium taxes and certain other general expenses that vary with, and are primarily related to, producing new or renewal business. Other underwriting expenses include policyholder dividends, changes in estimates of future write-offs of premiums receivable, general administrative expenses such as salaries and benefits, rent, office supplies, depreciation, and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately. Policy acquisition costs are variable based on premiums earned. Other operating expenses are more fixed in nature and become a smaller percentage of net premiums earned as premiums increase.\nWhile we oversee all of our investment activities, we employ Conning as our independent investment manager. Conning follows our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by our Board of Directors and our asset allocation is reevaluated by management and reviewed by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We also utilize Conning's investment advisory services. These services include investment accounting and portfolio modeling using DFA. The DFA tool is utilized in developing a tailored set of portfolio targets and objectives, which in turn, are considered when constructing an optimal portfolio.\n\nOur underwriting and other operating expenses ratio was 19.7%, 19.5%, and 18.9%, and our underwriting and other operating expenses were $136.1 million, $135.2 million, and $129.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our compensation-related expenses increased $2.3 million and premium taxes and assessments increased $1.5 million, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in our bad debt expense, each as compared to 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our bad debt expense increased $2.8 million, compensation-related expenses increased $1.5 million, professional fees increased $1.2 million, and IT expense increased $0.9 million, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in our premium taxes and assessments, each as compared to 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 Net realized gains (losses) on investments of $11.2 million, $(10.7) million, and $16.3 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively; and \nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process. Recognition (Step 1) occurs when we conclude that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step 2) is addressed only if Step 1 has been satisfied. Under Step 2, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\n (2) Estimated losses and LAE reserve payment patterns have been computed based on historical information. Our calculation of loss and LAE reserve payments by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of reserves and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims (including claims that have not yet been reported to us) will be paid. For a discussion of our reserving process, see ''-Critical Accounting Policies-Reserves for Losses and LAE.'' Actual payments of losses and LAE by period will vary, perhaps materially, from the above table to the extent that current estimates of losses and LAE reserves vary from actual ultimate claims amounts due to variations between expected and actual payout patterns. \nSources of Liquidity\nWe have actively driven a significant increase in claims settlement activity beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2016, which has primarily affected accident years 2009 and forward, that is the result of an internal initiative that emphasizes the settlement of open claims. This settlement activity has been recognized in the actuarial analysis using a methodology developed to adjust the data and loss development patterns to account for the settlements arising from this initiative.\nAdditionally, we are entitled to receive a contingent profit commission under the LPT Agreement. The contingent profit commission is an amount based on the favorable difference between actual paid losses and LAE and expected paid losses and LAE as established in the LPT Agreement. The calculation of actual amounts paid versus expected amounts is determined every five years beginning June 30, 2004 for the first twenty-five years of the agreement. We are paid 30% of the favorable difference between the actual and expected losses and LAE paid at each calculation point. Each quarter, management records its best estimate of the estimated ultimate contingent profit commission through June 30, 2024, which is impacted by estimates for ceded losses and LAE. The related Deferred Gain is amortized using the recovery method, whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries over the life of the contingent profit commission, or through June 30, 2024, and is recorded in losses and LAE incurred in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimates of the reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement may significantly impact the Contingent commission receivable-LPT Agreement and the Deferred Gain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and losses and LAE in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nWe are a holding company and our ability to fund our operations is contingent upon existing capital and the ability of our insurance subsidiaries' to pay dividends up to the holding company. Payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws and regulations, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. We require cash to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, make interest and principal payments on any outstanding debt obligations, provide additional surplus to our insurance subsidiaries, and fund our operating expenses.\nValuation of Investments\nWe use third party pricing services to assist us with our investment accounting function. The fair values of our available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, when available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level 1 or Level 2 inputs in accordance with GAAP guidance. The Company obtains a quoted price for each security from third party pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities. For securities not actively traded, the third party pricing services may use quoted market prices of similar instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, and prepayment speeds. The Company also performs quarterly analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value, including confirming the fair values of these securities through observable market prices using an alternative pricing source. If differences are noted in this review, the Company may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. (See Note 5 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nContractual Obligations and Commitments. The following table identifies our long-term debt and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016.\nwe believe that the holding company's cash needs for the foreseeable future will be met with its cash and investments on hand, as well as dividends available from its insurance subsidiaries.\nLoss and LAE Ratio.\nAs of December 31, 2016, California and Nevada represented approximately 77% of our loss reserves on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe analyze our loss and LAE ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis.\n (1) Adjusted stockholders' equity is a non-GAAP measure consisting of total GAAP stockholders' equity plus the Deferred Gain, less Accumulated other comprehensive income, net.  Our net income was $106.7 million, $94.4 million, and $100.7 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and our underwriting income was $57.3 million, $40.4 million, and $20.6 million for the same periods, respectively. The key factors that affected our financial performance during the previous two years included:\nUnderwriting and Other Operating Expenses Ratio.\nDeferred Gain. The Deferred Gain, which totaled $174.9 million and $189.5 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflects the unamortized gain from the LPT Agreement. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe monitor the cash flows of each of our subsidiaries individually, as well as collectively as a consolidated group. We use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs, making adjustments to our forecasts as appropriate.\nThe accident year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing losses and LAE, regardless of when such losses and LAE are incurred, for insured events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year. The accident year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year develop favorably or unfavorably. The accident year loss and LAE ratio is based on our statutory financial statements and is not derived from our GAAP financial information.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2016 included purchases of our common stock and payments of dividends to common stockholders. These financing cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from stock-based compensation, mainly proceeds from exercises of stock options.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOperating Subsidiaries' Liquidity\nReinsurance recoverables represent: (a) amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and LAE; (b) amounts recoverable from reinsurers on estimates of reported losses; and (c) amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of IBNR for losses and LAE. These recoverables are based on our current estimates of the underlying loss reserves, and are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets separately as assets, as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders. We bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers, which can be significant considering that some of the loss reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time. Reinsurers may refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them, or they might delay payment. We are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement. We continually monitor the financial condition and financial strength ratings of our reinsurers. No material amounts due from reinsurers have been written-off as uncollectible since our inception in 2000, and we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment.\nof claims arising from a specific time period, rather than a specific claim. Most of our IBNR reserves relate to estimated future claim payments on recorded open claims.\nAdditionally, any adjustment to the estimated ceded reserves under the LPT Agreement results in a cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, which is also included in losses and LAE incurred in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, so that the Deferred Gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the LPT Agreement. The table below provides the actuarial range of estimated liabilities for gross loss reserves under the LPT Agreement and our carried reserves.\nCommission expenses include direct commissions to our agents and brokers for the premiums that they produce for us, as well as incentive payments, other marketing costs, and fees. Some of our agency contracts contain incentive clauses, and the terms of those agency incentives are specific to individual contracts and vary as a result of agency performance.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10). This update replaces the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (trading or available-for-sale) and requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net income. Additionally, this update eliminates the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost. It requires financial instruments to be measured at fair value using the exit price notion. Furthermore, this update clarifies that an evaluation of deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale securities is needed, in combination with an evaluation of other deferred tax assets, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This update will result in a reclassification adjustment, net of tax, to retained earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income, which will be determined based on the fair value of securities at the effective date of adoption.\nOur current accident year loss estimates were 65.2%, 66.2%, and 73.6% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decreasing trend in our current accident year loss estimates reflects the impact of key business initiatives, including: accelerating the settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, underwrite, and price profitable classes of business across all of our markets. In addition, we have increased rates in the LA Area in California limiting our growth in that territory, while we continue to grow in other territories within and outside of California. The current accident year loss estimate for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the impact of $6.5 million in large losses recognized in the second quarter of 2016, which increased the current accident year loss estimate for the year.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2015 included net premiums received of $678.9 million, and investment income received of $84.9 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $427.7 million, underwriting and other operating expenses paid of $121.3 million, and commissions paid of $82.9 million.\nNet Premiums Written\nThe following noteworthy items were included in our 2016 results of operations: (1) favorable prior year accident year loss development of $18.4 million, including $17.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary business and $1.4 million of favorable development on our assigned risk business, which decreased our losses and LAE by the same amount; (2) favorable development in the estimated reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $3.1 million cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain and reduced our losses and LAE by the same amount (LPT Reserve Adjustment); and (3) an increase in the contingent commission receivable under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $1.8 million cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, and reduced our losses and LAE by the same amount (LPT Contingent Commission Adjustment). Collectively, these items increased our net income before taxes by $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nManagement, along with our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary, separately analyze LAE and estimate unpaid LAE. These analyses rely primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amounts that have been spent on LAE historically, compared with the volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical calendar periods. The portion of unpaid LAE that will be recoverable from reinsurers is estimated based on the contractual reinsurance terms.\nWe are a Nevada holding company. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to select, small businesses in low to medium hazard industries. Workers' compensation insurance is provided under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees' medical, disability, vocational rehabilitation, and/or death benefit costs for work-related injuries or illnesses. We provide workers' compensation insurance in 36 states and the District of Columbia, with a concentration in California, where over one-half of our business is generated. Our revenues are primarily comprised of net premiums earned, net investment income, and net realized gains on investments.\nNotes Payable. The surplus notes bear interest at a fixed rate of between 405 and 425 basis points in excess of the 90-day LIBOR per annum, payable quarterly. We may redeem the surplus notes at any time at their face value of $32.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The surplus notes mature in 2034.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This update replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments with a methodology that reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. This update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented net of an allowance for credit losses. Additionally, this update requires credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down, allowing an entity to also record reversals of credit losses in current period net income. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have not yet estimated the full impact that the adoption will have on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of deferred taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses resulting from sales of investments are recognized in operations on a specific-identification basis.\nThe following table shows the percentage change in our in-force premiums, policy count, average policy size, payroll exposure upon which our premiums are based, and net rate as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, overall, for California, where 56% of our premiums were generated, and for all other states, excluding California:\nImpairment of Investment Securities. When, in the opinion of management, a decline in the fair value of an equity security below its cost is considered to be other-than-temporary,\u201d the equity security's cost is written down to its fair value at the time the other-than-temporary decline is identified. The determination of an other-than-temporary decline for debt securities includes, in addition to other relevant factors, a presumption that if the fair value is below cost by a significant amount for a period of time, a bifurcation of the write-down may be necessary. If management has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, the investment is written down to its fair value and the entire impairment is recorded as a realized loss due to credit in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. If management does not have the intent to sell or will not be required to sell the debt security but does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the debt security, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment is bifurcated between credit loss and other loss and recorded as a component of realized gains and losses and in other comprehensive income, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The amount of any write-down is determined by the difference between the cost or amortized cost of the debt security and its fair value at the time the other-than-temporary decline is identified.\n (1) LPT Reserve Adjustments result in a cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, which is recognized in losses and LAE incurred on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, such that the Deferred Gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the LPT Agreement. (See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.) \nThe range of estimates of loss reserves produced by our actuarial reviews of medical cost inflation data provide some indication of the potential variability of future losses and LAE payments; however, the full range of potential variation is difficult to estimate because our insurance subsidiaries do not have a lengthy operating history in many of the states in which we now operate. Our reserve estimates reflect expected increases in the costs of contested claims, but do not assume any losses resulting from significant new legal liability theories. Our reserve estimates also assume that there will not be significant future changes in the regulatory and legislative environment. In the event of significant new legal liability theories or new regulation or legislation, we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business.\nIn Nevada, we have compiled a lengthy history of workers' compensation claims payment patterns based on the business of the Fund and EICN, but the emergence and payment of claims in recent years has been more favorable than in the long-term history in Nevada with the Fund. The expected patterns of claim payments and emergence used in the projection of our ultimate claim payments are based on both long and short-term historical data. In recent evaluations, claim patterns have continued to emerge in a manner consistent with short-term historical data. Consequently, our selection of claim projection patterns has relied more heavily on patterns observed in recent years.\nInvestments\n \u2022 Losses and LAE decreased 3% in 2016 and 5% in 2015, each compared to the previous year; \nA portion of our obligations for losses and LAE are ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers. The amount of reinsurance that will be recoverable on our losses and LAE includes both the reinsurance recoverable from our excess of loss reinsurance contracts, as well as reinsurance recoverable under the terms of the LPT Agreement.\nEach actuarial methodology requires the selection and application of various parameters and assumptions. The key parameters and assumptions include: the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time; the magnitude and changes in claim settlement activity, claims cost inflation rates; the effects of legislative benefit changes and/or judicial changes; and trends in the frequency of claims, both overall and by severity of claim. We believe the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or emerge over time, claim settlement activity, claims cost inflation rates, and claim frequencies are the most important parameters and assumptions.\nCapital Resources\nIncome tax expense was $34.0 million, $5.0 million, and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 24.2%, 5.0%, and 5.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. For 2016, tax-advantaged investment income, LPT Reserve Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory 35% rate by $15.3 million. For 2015, tax-advantaged investment income, pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory 35% rate by $29.8 million. For 2014, tax-advantaged investment income, pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory 35% rate by $31.4 million.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\n\n (1) Net rate, defined as total in-force premiums divided by total insured payroll exposure, is a function of a variety of factors, including rate changes, underwriting risk profiles and pricing, and changes in business mix related to economic and competitive pressures. \nFor Nevada losses occurring in 2007 or prior, one method involves adjusting historical data for inflation. The inflation rates used in the analysis are judgmentally selected based on historical year-to-year movements in the cost of claims observed in our insurance\n\nThe following noteworthy items were included in our 2014 results of operations: (1) favorable development in the estimated reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $31.1 million LPT Reserve Adjustment; (2) an increase in the contingent commission receivable under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $10.8 million LPT Contingent Commission Adjustment; and (3) a reallocation of $13.1 million of losses and LAE reserves from non-taxable periods prior to January 1, 2000, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.4 percentage points. Collectively, these items increased our net income before taxes by $41.9 million and decreased our income tax expense by $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn California, where our operations began in 2002, the actuaries' and management's initial expectations of ultimate losses and patterns of loss emergence and payment were based on benchmarks derived from analyses of historical insurance industry data in California. No historical data from our California insurance subsidiary existed prior to July 1, 2002; however, some historical data was available for the prior years for some of the market segments we entered in California, but was limited as to the number of loss reserve evaluation points available. The industry-based benchmarks were judgmentally adjusted for the anticipated impact of significant environmental changes, specifically the enactment of major changes to the statutory workers' compensation benefit structure and the manner in which claims are administered and adjudicated in California. The actual emergence and payment of claims by our California insurance subsidiary have been more favorable than those initial expectations through 2008, due in part to the impact of the enactment of major changes in the California workers' compensation environment. Our recent loss experience, from 2010 through 2016, indicates an upward trend in medical and indemnity costs that are reflected in our loss reserves; however, our indemnity claims frequency (the number of claims expressed as a percentage of payroll) decreased year-over-year for the past three years. Our reserve estimates assume that increasing medical cost trends will continue and will impact our long-term claims costs and loss reserves.\nWe prepare an impairment analysis for goodwill and other intangible assets, whereby we identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events, such as cash flows and profitability. Differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results.\nOn January 1, 2000, EICN assumed the assets, liabilities, and operations of the Fund pursuant to legislation passed in the 1999 Nevada Legislature (the Privatization). Prior to the Privatization, the Fund was part of the State of Nevada and therefore was not subject to federal income tax. Accordingly, our pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments and Deferred Gain amortization impact our net income but do not change our taxable income.\n (1) Notes payable includes payments of the principal and estimated interest expense on our surplus notes outstanding based on LIBOR plus a margin. The interest rates used ranged from 4.9% to 5.1%. \n\nThe calendar year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and LAE incurred during the calendar year, regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred, by the net premiums earned during that calendar year. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and LAE established for insured events occurring in the current and prior years. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods.\nThe table below provides the actuarial range of loss reserves that management considered when selecting its best estimate and our carried reserves.\nIn projections using December 31, 2016 data, the method that uses explicit medical cost inflation assumptions included medical cost inflation factors ranging from 1.5% to 4.5%. The selection of medical cost inflation assumptions used has been based on observed recent and longer-term historical medical cost inflation in our claims data and in the U.S. economy more generally. The rate of medical cost inflation, as reflected in our historical medical payments per claim, has averaged approximately 3.0% over the past 15 years. The rate of medical cost inflation in the general U.S. economy, as measured by the consumer price index-medical care, has averaged approximately 3.6% over the past 15 years.\nFinancing Activities\nWhen claims are reported to us, we establish individual estimates of the ultimate cost of each claim (case reserves). These case reserves are continually monitored and revised in response to new information and for amounts paid.\nOur indemnity claims frequency (the number of claims expressed as a percentage of payroll) continued to decrease year-over-year in 2016 and 2015; however, our loss experience indicates a slight upward movement in medical and indemnity costs per claim that are reflected in our current accident year loss estimates. In California, we experienced increased costs per claim associated with an increase in the number of cumulative trauma claims filed during 2015, compared to 2014. Total claims costs have also been reduced by cost savings associated with increased claims settlement activity beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2016. We believe our current accident year loss estimate is adequate; however, ultimate losses will not be known with any certainty for many years. We assume that increasing medical and indemnity cost trends will continue to impact our long-term claims costs and current accident year loss estimate, which may be offset by rate increases. Additional information regarding our reserves for losses and LAE is set forth under -Critical Accounting Policies-Reserves for Losses and LAE.\u201d\nCommission Expense Ratio.\n (2) LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments result in a cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, which is recognized in losses and LAE incurred on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, such that the Deferred Gain reflects the balance that would have \nNet cash used in investing activities in 2016, 2015, and 2014 was primarily related to the investment of premiums received and the reinvestment of funds from maturities, redemptions, and interest income. These investing cash outflows were partially offset by investment sales whose proceeds were used to fund claims payments, underwriting and other operating expenses, common stock dividend payments, and common stock repurchases.\nResults of Operations\nTotal cash and investments held by our operating subsidiaries was $2,560.5 million at December 31, 2016, consisting of $23.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $16.0 million of short-term investments, $2,328.4 million of fixed maturity securities and $192.2 million of equity securities. Sources of immediate and unencumbered liquidity at our operating subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 consisted of $20.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, $142.0 million of publicly-traded equity securities whose proceeds are available within four business days, and $1.3 billion of highly liquid fixed maturity securities whose proceeds are available within four business days. We believe that our subsidiaries' liquidity needs over the next 24 months will be met with cash from operations, investment income, and maturing investments.\nThe ranges of estimates of loss reserves produced by our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary are intended to represent the range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses will fall. These ranges are narrower than the range of indications produced by the individual methods applied because it is not likely that the high or low result will emerge for every claim segment and accident year. Each actuary's point estimate of loss reserves is based on a judgmental selection for each claim segment from within the range of results indicated by the different actuarial methods.\nFor additional information regarding our investments, including the cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and estimated fair value of our investments, the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities by contractual maturity, and net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) on fixed maturity and equity securities, see Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nVarious state laws and regulations require us to hold investment securities or letters of credit on deposit with certain states in which we do business. Securities having a fair value of $1,009.7 million and $881.2 million were on deposit at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These laws and regulations govern both the amount and types of investment securities that are eligible for deposit. Additionally, certain reinsurance contracts require company funds to be held in trust for the benefit of the ceding reinsurer to secure the outstanding liabilities we assumed. The fair value of fixed maturity securities held in trust for the benefit of our ceding reinsurers was $27.2 million and $32.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe following outlines each component of our total capital resources:\nNet investment income was $73.2 million, $72.2 million, and $72.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The average pre-tax book yield on our invested assets was 3.1%, 3.2%, and 3.2% at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The average tax-equivalent yield on our invested assets, which adjusts the book yield of our investments in tax-advantaged securities to an equivalent pre-tax book yield, was 3.6%, 3.8%, and 3.8% as of the same dates, respectively.\nNet premiums earned were $694.8 million, $690.4 million, and $684.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Net premiums earned are primarily a function of the amount and timing of net premiums previously written.\nThe amount by which estimated losses in the aggregate differ from those previously estimated for a specific time period is known as reserve development.\u201d Reserve development is unfavorable when losses ultimately settle for more than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims, causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be ''deficient.'' Reserve development is favorable when estimates of ultimate losses indicate a decrease in established reserves, causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be ''redundant.'' Development is reflected in our operating results through an adjustment to incurred losses and LAE during the period in which it is recognized.\nThe following noteworthy items were included in our 2015 results of operations: (1) favorable prior year accident year loss development of $7.2 million, including $9.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary business, partially offset by $1.8 million of unfavorable development on our assigned risk business, which decreased our losses and LAE by the same amount; (2) favorable development in the estimated reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement that resulted in a $6.4 million LPT Reserve Adjustment; (3) an increase in the contingent commission receivable under the LPT Agreement, which resulted in a $2.6 million LPT Contingent Commission Adjustment; and (4) a reallocation of $56.3 million of losses and LAE reserves from non-taxable periods prior to January 1, 2000, which reduced our effective tax rate by 15.4 percentage points. Collectively, these items increased our net income before taxes by $16.2 million and decreased our income tax expense by $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nManagement formally establishes loss reserves for financial statement purposes on a quarterly basis. In doing so, we make reference to the most current analyses of our Internal Actuary and of the Consulting Actuary, including a review of the assumptions and the results of the various actuarial methods used. Comprehensive studies are conducted in the second and fourth quarters by both our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary. On the alternate quarters, the results of the preceding quarter's studies are updated for actual claim payment activity by our Internal Actuary.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update provides guidance on a new lessee model that includes the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet. Additionally, the update provides clarity on the definition of a lease and the distinction between finance and operating leases. Furthermore, the update requires certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures pertaining to the amounts recorded in the financial statements. This update becomes effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We have not yet estimated the full impact that the adoption will have on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting for workers' compensation insurance requires us to estimate the liability for the expected ultimate cost of unpaid losses and LAE (loss reserves) as of a balance sheet date. Loss reserve estimates are inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount we pay for many of the claims we have incurred as of the balance sheet date will not be known for many years. Our estimate of loss reserves is intended to equal the difference between the expected ultimate losses and LAE of all claims that have occurred as of a balance sheet date and amounts already paid. We establish loss reserves based on our own analysis of emerging claims experience and environmental conditions in our markets and review of the results of various actuarial projections. Our aggregate carried loss reserves is the sum of our reserves for each accident year and represents our best estimate of outstanding loss reserves.\nThe aggregate carried reserve calculated by management represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and LAE. In establishing management's best estimate of unpaid losses and LAE at December 31 for the last three years, management and our Internal Actuary reviewed and considered the following: (a) our Internal Actuary's and the Consulting Actuary's assumptions, point estimates, and ranges; (b) the inherent uncertainty of workers' compensation loss reserves; and (c) the potential for legislative and/or judicial reversal of California workers' compensation reforms. Management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each uncertainty, but rather established an overall provision that represented management's best estimate of loss reserves in light of the historical data, actuarial assumptions, point estimate and range, and current facts and circumstances.\nWe invest in fixed maturity securities, equity securities, short-term investments, and cash equivalents. Net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities, less bank service charges and custodial and portfolio management fees. We have established a high quality/short duration bias in our investment portfolio.\nThe comparative components of net income are set forth in the following table:\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes thereto, and the financial statement schedules included in Item 8 and Item 15 of this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors described in Item 1A of this report. Our actual results in future periods may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including the risks described in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d elsewhere in this report.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our investment portfolio, which is classified as available-for-sale, consisted of 91.9% fixed maturity securities. We strive to limit the interest rate risk associated with fixed maturity investments by managing the duration of these securities. Our fixed maturity securities (excluding cash and cash equivalents) had a duration of 4.3 years at December 31, 2016. To minimize interest rate risk, our portfolio is weighted toward short-term and intermediate-term bonds; however, our investment strategy balances consideration of duration, yield, and credit risk. Our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio be AA-,\u201d using ratings assigned by S&P. Our fixed maturity securities portfolio had a weighted average quality of AA-\u201d as of December 31, 2016, with 57.2% of the portfolio rated AA\u201d or better, based on market value.\n \u2022 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income - This standard requires that the tax effects of stock-based compensation be recognized in the income tax expense. Net tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $1.4 million were recognized as a reduction to Income tax expense and an increase to Net income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2016. These changes increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This standard also requires that assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method be modified to exclude the excess tax benefits that would have been recognized in Additional paid-in capital. These changes were applied on a prospective basis. \nInvestments that we currently own could be subject to default by the issuer or could suffer declines in fair value that become other-than-temporary. We regularly assess individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management, including the identification of other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Our other-than-temporary impairment assessment includes reviewing the extent and duration of declines in fair value of investments below amortized cost, historical and projected financial performance and near-term prospects of the issuer, the outlook for industry sectors, credit rating, and macro-economic changes. We also make a\nOur commission expense ratio was 12.0%, 12.4%, and 11.9%, and our commission expenses were $83.5 million, $85.4 million, and $81.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in our commission expense ratio in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to lower agency incentives. The increase in the commission expense ratio in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to higher agency incentives.\nIf the actual loss reserves were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range, the impact on our financial results would have been as follows:\nThe primary sources of cash for our insurance operating subsidiaries are premium collections, investment income, sales and maturities of investments and reinsurance recoveries. The primary uses of cash for our insurance subsidiaries are payments of losses and LAE, commission expenses, underwriting and other operating expenses, ceded reinsurance, investment purchases and dividends paid to their parent.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2016 included net premiums received of $694.9 million, and investment income received of $87.8 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $433.7 million, underwriting and other operating expenses paid of $125.8 million, and commissions paid of $84.2 million.\nWe retain an independent actuarial consulting firm (Consulting Actuary) to perform comprehensive studies of our loss reserves on a semi-annual basis. The role of the Consulting Actuary is to conduct sufficient analyses to produce a range of reasonable estimates, as well as a point estimate, of our loss reserves, and to present those results to our Internal Actuary and to management as supplemental data in selecting management's best estimate of ultimate losses.\nJudgment is required in the actuarial estimation of loss reserves, including the selection of various actuarial methodologies to project the ultimate cost of claims. Specifically, judgment is required in the following areas: the selection of projection parameters based on historical company data; the use of industry data and other benchmarks; the identification and quantification of potential changes in parameters from historical levels to current and future levels due to changes in future claims development expectations; and the weighting of differing reserve indications resulting from alternative methods and assumptions. The adequacy of our ultimate loss reserves is inherently uncertain and represents a significant risk to our business. We attempt to mitigate this risk through our claims management processes and by monitoring and reacting to statistics relating to the cost and duration of claims.\nBoth the payment of interest and repayment of the surplus notes are subject to the prior approval of the Florida Department of Financial Services.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU Number 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This update clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops revenue standards to improve the common revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue as performance obligations are met, in order to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity is entitled to receive for those goods or services. The following steps are applied in the updated guidance: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within that annual reporting period. Insurance contracts are not within the scope of this updated guidance and we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary prepare reserve estimates for all accident years using our own historical claims data, industry data and many of the generally accepted actuarial methodologies for estimating loss reserves, such as paid loss development methods, incurred loss development methods, and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. These methods vary in their responsiveness to different information, characteristics, and dynamics in the data, and the results assist the actuary in considering these characteristics and dynamics in the historical data. The methods employed for each segment of claims data, and the relative weight accorded to each method, vary depending on the nature of the claims segment and on the age of the claims.\nIncome Taxes\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards - Not Yet Adopted\nOther Income\nTotal cash and investments at the holding company were $57.3 million at December 31, 2016, consisting of $41.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $16.0 million of fixed maturity securities. We do not currently have a revolving credit facility because\n\n\nA primary measure of our performance is our ability to increase Adjusted stockholders' equity over the long-term. We believe that this measure is important to our investors, analysts, and other interested parties who benefit from having an objective and consistent basis for comparison with other companies within our industry. The following table shows a reconciliation of our stockholders' equity on a GAAP basis to our Adjusted stockholders' equity.\n (3) We define net income before impact of the LPT Agreement as net income before the impact of: (a) amortization of the Deferred Gain; (b) adjustments to the LPT Agreement ceded reserves; and (c) adjustments to the Contingent commission receivable -LPT Agreement. The Deferred Gain reflects the unamortized gain from the LPT Agreement. Under GAAP, this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method in which amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries over the life of the LPT Agreement, except for the contingent profit commission, which is amortized through June 30, 2024. The amortization is reflected in losses and LAE. We periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the LPT Agreement and the expected losses and LAE subject to the contingent profit commission under the LPT Agreement. Our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments, if needed, to reserves, ceded reserves, contingent commission receivable, and the Deferred Gain, with the net effect being an increase or decrease to our net income. Net income before impact of the LPT Agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, but rather reflects the difference in accounting treatment between statutory and GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income before income taxes or net income, or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP.  We present net income before impact of the LPT Agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of our ongoing operating performance to be used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating us. The LPT Agreement was a non-recurring transaction, under which the Deferred Gain does not affect our ongoing operations, and, consequently, we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance. In addition, we believe this non-GAAP measure, as we have defined it, is helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the excluded item has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations.\nFor additional information regarding our income tax expense see Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Tax Expense\nExcluding the impact from the LPT Agreement, losses and LAE would have been $434.5 million, $449.8 million, and $508.4 million, or 62.5%, 65.2%, and 74.3% of net premiums earned, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\n\nWe believe that we have appropriately identified the declines in the fair values of our unrealized losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. We determined that the unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily the result of prevailing interest rates and not the credit quality of the issuers. The fixed maturity securities whose fair value was less than amortized cost were not determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired given the lack of severity and duration of the impairment, the credit quality of the issuers, the Company's intent to not sell the securities, and a determination that it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities until fair value recovers to above cost, or principal value upon maturity.\nStockholders' Equity. The following table summarizes our beginning and ending stockholders' equity balance and the changes thereto for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\nOur underwriting results have improved over the past several years, which reflects the increased pricing flexibility afforded to us through the use of multiple writing companies within a state and territorial pricing in California. In addition, our ongoing underwriting initiatives, which are described below, have allowed us to expand our operations while also focusing on under-performing classes of business, as needed.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. Our accounting policies are described in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, but we believe that the following matters are particularly important to understand our financial statements because changes in these estimates or changes in the assumptions used to make them could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur loss reserves (gross and net of reinsurance), including the main components of such reserves, were as follows:\nThe following table shows the percentage of total estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2016 by credit rating category, using the lower of ratings assigned by Moody's Investors Service and/or S&P.\n \u2022 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows - This standard requires that the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation be reported as cash flows from operating activities rather than the previous requirement to present the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities. This update resulted in a change in presentation that was applied on a prospective basis and prior periods have not been adjusted.  This standard allows us to make a policy election as to whether we will include an estimate of stock-based compensation awards expected to be forfeited or whether it will account for forfeitures as they occur. We elected to continue to estimate forfeitures in the computation of our stock-based compensation, consistent with previous guidance, and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nLosses and LAE, Commission Expenses, and Underwriting and Other Operating Expenses\nOther income consists of net gains on fixed assets, non-investment interest, and other miscellaneous income. Other income was $0.6 million, $0.2 million, and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nFinally, this standard allows us to withhold an amount in excess of the supplemental rate from an employee's stock-based compensation for federal tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. It also clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee's behalf should be presented as cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This update related to tax withholding and presentation of cash flows had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the capital resources available to us consisted of: (i) $32.0 million of notes payable consisting of surplus notes maturing in 2034; (ii) $840.6 million of stockholders' equity; and (iii) the $174.9 million Deferred Gain.\n\n (3) The unpaid losses and LAE reserves are presented gross of reinsurance recoverables for unpaid losses, which were as follows for each of the periods presented above: \nOverall, losses and LAE were $417.9 million, $429.4 million, and $453.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in our losses and LAE from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to $18.4 million of net favorable prior accident year loss development in 2016 (versus $7.2 million of net favorable development in 2015), which included $17.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary risk business and $1.4 million of favorable development related to our assigned risk business. The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily related to $7.2 million of net favorable prior accident year loss development (versus $4.6 million of net unfavorable development in 2014), which included $9.0 million of favorable development on our voluntary risk business in 2015, which was partially offset by $1.8 million of unfavorable loss development related to our assigned risk business, and a decrease in the current accident year loss estimate. The favorable prior accident year loss development in 2016 and 2015 was the result of our determination that adjustments were necessary to reflect observed favorable paid loss trends in each of these years. Paid loss trends have been impacted by cost savings associated with accelerated claims settlement activity that began in 2014 and continued through 2016. The unfavorable prior accident year loss development in 2014 was primarily related to our assigned risk business. Additionally, there were favorable LPT Reserve Adjustments of $3.1 million, $6.4 million, and $31.1 million that decreased losses and LAE by those amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nThe three main components of our loss reserves are case reserves, incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss reserves, and LAE reserves.\nActual losses are affected by a more complex combination of forces and dynamics than any one model or actuarial methodology can represent, and each methodology is an approximation of these complex forces and dynamics. None of the methods are designed or intended to produce an indication that is systematically higher or lower than the other methods. At any given evaluation date, some of the actuarial projection methods produce indications outside the actuary's selected range. Accordingly, we believe that the range of potential outcomes is considerably wider than the actuarially estimated range of the most likely outcomes. We have no basis for anticipating whether actual future payments of losses and LAE may be either greater than or less than the loss reserves currently on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe recognized impairments of $5.8 million (consisting of 37 equity securities), $17.2 million (consisting of 27 equity securities), and $0.5 million (consisting of seven equity securities) during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The other-than temporary impairments recognized during these years related to equity securities were the result of the Company's intent to sell and/or the severity and duration of the change in fair values of these securities, primarily due to the downturn in the energy sector that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Certain unrealized losses on equity securities were not considered to be other-than-temporary due to the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers, and our intent to hold the securities until fair value recovers to above cost.\n\nReserves for Losses and LAE\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nPremium revenue is recognized as earned over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. At the end of the policy term, payroll-based premium audits are performed on substantially all policyholder accounts to determine net premiums earned for the policy year. Earned but unbilled premiums include estimated future audit premiums based on our historical experience. These estimates are subject to changes in policyholders' payrolls, economic conditions, and seasonality, and are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known. Any such adjustments are included in current operations; however, they are partially offset by the resulting changes in losses and LAE, commission expenses, and premium taxes. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, we believe that the net effect of any estimates currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment.\nfavorable or unfavorable) of reserves established in prior periods. In contrast, we analyze our accident year loss and LAE ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and LAE from insured events occurring during that year. The loss and LAE ratios provided in this report are calendar year basis, except where they are expressly identified as accident year loss and LAE ratios.\nsubsidiaries' data and industry-wide data, as well as on broader inflation indices. The results of this method would differ if different inflation rates were selected.\nRealized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Realized gains and losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original or adjusted cost (equity securities) or amortized cost (fixed maturity securities). Realized losses are also recognized when securities are written down as a result of an other-than-temporary impairment.\nstrategies.\nWe purchase reinsurance to protect us against the costs of severe claims and catastrophic events. On July 1, 2016, we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through June 30, 2017. The reinsurance program consists of one treaty covering excess of loss and catastrophic loss events in four layers of coverage. Our reinsurance coverage is $190.0 million in excess of our $10.0 million retention on a per occurrence basis, subject to certain exclusions. We believe that our excess of loss reinsurance program currently meets our needs.\nNew Accounting Standards\nThe following table shows the estimated fair value, the percentage of the fair value to total invested assets, the average book yield, and the average tax equivalent yield (each based on the fair value of each category of invested assets) as of December 31, 2016.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce our provision for income taxes.\nDividends. Dividends paid to stockholders were $11.5 million, $7.7 million, and $7.6 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends to common stockholders will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial position, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, legal and regulatory requirements, and any other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. On February 22, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a $0.15 dividend per share, payable March 22, 2017, to stockholders of record on March 8, 2017.\nNet realized gains (losses) on investments were $11.2 million, $(10.7) million, and $16.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Net realized gains on investments in 2016 were primarily the result of the sale of equity securities as part of a re-balancing of our equity investments portfolio to meet cash needs at the holding company, and to provide cash to support the internal restructuring of our insurance subsidiaries. Those gains were partially offset by $5.8 million in other-than-temporary impairments of certain equity securities due to our intent to sell securities, and the downturn in the energy sector during that year. Net realized losses on investments in 2015 were primarily the result of other-than-temporary impairments of certain equity securities during the fourth quarter due to the downturn in the energy sector during that year. The net realized gains on investments for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to a re-balancing of our equity investment portfolio. Additional information regarding our Investments is set forth under -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Investments\u201d and Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur investment portfolio is structured to support our need for: (i) optimizing our risk-adjusted total return; (ii) providing adequate liquidity; (iii) facilitating financial strength and stability; and (iv) ensuring regulatory and legal compliance.\nInvesting Activities\nHolding Company Liquidity\nThe table below reflects losses and LAE reserve adjustments and the impact of the LPT on net income before taxes.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis. Surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets. The amount of capital in our insurance subsidiaries is maintained relative to standardized capital adequacy measures such as risk-based capital (RBC), as established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The RBC standard was designed to provide a measure by which regulators can assess the adequacy of an insurance company's capital and surplus relative to its operations. An insurance company must maintain capital and surplus of at least 200% of RBC. Each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the minimum RBC requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action at December 31, 2016.\nReinsurance Recoverables\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). This update provides guidance for the classification and presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. This update requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. It requires the disclosure of information about the nature of restrictions on its cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This update also requires the entity to disclose, on the face of the statement of cash flows or in the notes to the financial statements, any restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents disaggregated by the line item in which they appear within the statement of financial position. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have determined the adoption of this standard will have no material financial impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and statement of cash flows.\n \u2022 Underwriting and other operating expenses increased 1% in 2016 and 5% in 2015, each compared to the previous year; \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the total amortized cost of our investment portfolio was $2.4 billion and its fair value was $2.6 billion. These investments provide a source of income, which may fluctuate with changes in interest rates and our current investment\nOur insurance subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to their parent is based on reported capital, surplus, and dividends paid within the last 12 months. For 2017, EICN and EPIC cannot pay any dividends without prior regulatory approval; ECIC can pay $4.6 million of dividends through June 21, 2017 and $38.1 million thereafter without prior regulatory approval, provided that no dividends are paid prior to June 21, 2017; and EAC can pay $18.0 million of dividends beginning July 6, 2017 without prior regulatory approval.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIf the actual gross loss reserves under the LPT Agreement were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range, the impact on our financial results, excluding the impact of the contingent profit commission, would have been as follows:\nMore than 60% of our claims payments during the three years ended December 31, 2016 related to medical care for injured workers. The utilization and cost of medical services in the future is a significant source of uncertainty in the establishment of loss reserves for workers' compensation. Our loss reserves are established based on reviewing the results of actuarial methods, some of which do not contain explicit medical claim cost inflation rates; however, because medical care may be provided to an injured worker over many years, and in some cases decades, the pace of medical claim cost inflation has a significant impact on our ultimate claim payments. For example, if the rate of medical claim cost inflation increases by 1% above the inflation rate that is implicitly included in the loss reserves at December 31, 2016, we estimate that future medical costs over the lifetime of current claims would increase by approximately $88 million on a net-of-reinsurance basis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIBNR is an actuarial estimate of future payments on claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us. In addition to this provision for late reported claims, we also estimate and make a provision for the extent to which the case reserves on known claims may develop and for additional payments on closed claims, known as reopening.\u201d IBNR reserves apply to the entire body\nOur Internal Actuary has been named as the \"Appointed Actuary\" for financial statement periods ending on or after December 31, 2015 and therefore all reserve figures shown as of and after December 31, 2015 are based on our internal actuarial analysis.\nThe following table presents our calendar year combined ratios.\n\n \u2022 Income tax expense was $34.0 million, $5.0 million, and $5.9 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  We continue to execute a number of ongoing business initiatives, including: focusing on internal and customer-facing business process excellence; accelerating the settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; utilizing a multi-company pricing platform; utilizing territory-specific pricing; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, price, and underwrite profitable classes of business across all of our markets.\nNet premiums written were $694.6 million, $689.3 million, and $687.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, which included $6.8 million, $8.4 million, and $10.1 million of reinsurance premiums ceded, respectively. The decreases in reinsurance premiums ceded from 2014 to 2016 reflect the increases in our retention on a per occurrence basis under our current excess of loss reinsurance program compared to earlier periods.\nWe compile and aggregate our claims data by grouping the claims according to the year in which the claim occurred ( accident year\u201d) when analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time. Additionally, claims data is aggregated and compiled separately for different types of claims, claimant benefits, or methods of claim closure and for different states, territories within states, or groups of states in which we do business.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU Number 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). This update provides guidance and clarification on eight specific cash flow issues due to diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The cash flow issues affected are debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interest in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have determined the adoption of this standard will have no material financial impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and statement of cash flows.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2015 and 2014 included payments of dividends to common stockholders and repayment of notes payable and capital leases. These financing cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from stock-based compensation, mainly proceeds and income tax benefits from exercises of stock options.\nGross Premiums Written\nWe believe that our current asset allocation meets our strategy to preserve capital for claims and policy liabilities and to provide sufficient capital resources to support and grow our ongoing insurance operations.\nWe use actuarial methods to analyze and estimate the aggregate amount of loss reserves. Management considers the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions, among other factors, in establishing loss reserves.\nexisted had the revised contingent profit commission been recognized at the inception of the LPT Agreement. (See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nRecognition of Premium Revenue\nThe table below shows our net cash flows. For additional information regarding our cash flows, see Item 8, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nEach of our insurance subsidiaries became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) in January 2016. Membership allows our subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support and enhance liquidity management. The amount of advances that may be taken is dependent on statutory admitted assets on a per company basis. Currently, none of our subsidiaries has advances outstanding under the FHLB facility.\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments\nLosses and LAE represents our largest expense item and includes claim payments made, amortization of the Deferred Gain, LPT Reserve Adjustments, LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments, estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods, and costs associated with investigating, defending, and adjusting claims. The quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and LAE, which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques.\nOverview\n\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nBusiness Overview\n- Workers' compensation insurance company focused on small businesses in low to medium hazard industries. Main market is California. \n- Revenues primarily from net premiums earned, net investment income, and net realized investment gains.\n\n2016 Financial Highlights\n- Net income was $106.7 million. \n- Losses and LAE decreased 3% compared to 2015 due to favorable prior accident year loss development.\n- Underwriting income was $57.3 million.\n- Combined ratio was 91.8%.\n\nKey Factors Impacting Results\n- Favorable prior accident year loss development reduced losses in 2016 and 2015.\n- Favorable adjustments to reserves and contingent commission receivable under the LPT Agreement reduced losses in all three years.\n- Income tax expense was reduced by tax-advantaged investments and LPT Agreement adjustments.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Holdings consist of cash, short-term investments, fixed maturity securities, and equity securities. Asset allocation balances liquidity, return, and risk management.\n- Operating subsdiaries have sufficient liquidity from premiums, investments, and maturities to fund near term operations.\n- Holding company cash needs met through operating subsidiary dividends and holding company assets.\n- Maintains strong RBC ratios.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Reserves for unpaid losses and LAE requires significant judgment and is inherently uncertain.\n- Goodwill and intangibles requires estimates and assumptions about future cash flows and performance.\n- Investments reported at fair value, which requires judgment, especially for infrequently traded securities.\n\nThat covers the major points from the report. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."}
