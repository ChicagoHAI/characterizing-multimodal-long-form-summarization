Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this Report, the risk factors appearing in Item 1A of this Report, and the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements appearing at the beginning of Item 1 of this Report. We have elected to omit discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by the consolidated financial statements presented. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2020, for the discussion of the year ended December 31, 2018, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented.\nOverview\nOn December 20, 2020, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Lockheed Martin and the Merger Sub, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin.\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $56.00 per share, without interest, less, to the extent paid or payable as outlined below, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (defined below).\nOn December 19, 2020, our Board of Directors declared the one-time Pre-Closing Dividend in cash of $5.00 per share (including shares underlying the 2\u00bc% Notes participating on an as-converted basis). The Pre-Closing Dividend is payable on March 24, 2021, to the holders of our shares and 2\u00bc% Notes as of the close of business on March 10, 2021. The $56.00 per share price under the Merger Agreement is expected to be reduced to $51.00 after the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend to our stockholders and holders of our 2\u00bc% Notes participating on an as-converted basis (or, in the unlikely event that closing occurs after March 10, 2021, but before March 24, 2021, to the extent the Pre-Closing Dividend is payable after the closing).\nClosing of the Merger is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2021, subject to various customary conditions, including our stockholder approval and regulatory approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.\nA summary of the significant financial highlights for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition, is presented below.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions, except percentage and per share amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,072.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,981.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>137.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income as a percentage of net sales </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP measure*) </td> <td>138.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP measure*) as a percentage of net sales </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\") - Diluted </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP measure*) </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) </td> <td>270.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) as a percentage of net sales </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>363.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>261.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure*) </td> <td>309.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> _________\n* We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under the heading \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nOur business outlook is affected by both increasing complexity in the global security environment and continuing worldwide economic pressures, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on protecting our employees' health and safety, delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.\nSome of the significant challenges we face are as follows: uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments, companies, and individuals in response, including the distribution of a vaccine, dependence upon U.S. government programs and contracts, future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending in our markets, environmental matters, capital structure, underfunded pension plan, and cyber security.\nCOVID-19\nDuring 2020, there was minimal adverse impact to our financial results and operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The safety and welfare of our employees remains our top priority, and throughout the year, we have continued to operate with our established safety protocols, which include selected and site-specific work and travel restrictions, in addition to other measures intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We have also continued to evaluate new opportunities to protect our employees. Although we have not experienced significant absenteeism or supply chain disruption, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our future financial results depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and the actions being taken to contain and treat it, including the distribution of a vaccine, and other indirect effects that may come as a result of actions taken by governments, companies, and individuals in response to the pandemic and its economic impact.\nAs a defense industrial-base U.S. government contractor, we are considered an essential business by the U.S. and state governments and we continue to operate as such during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are taking a variety of measures to maintain the availability and functionality of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees and to support the communities in which we operate. In making decisions regarding our operations, we take into account public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the adoption of mask-wearing protocols, enhanced cleaning protocols and health monitoring, as well as the imposition of travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing, and the adoption of work-from-home requirements for employees where practicable. All of these policies and initiatives could impact our operations. Due to the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, corresponding U.S. government policies and the uncertainty relating to the rollout and timing of vaccines, we are not able at this time to estimate its full impact on our financial results and operations.\nMajor Customers\nThe principal end user customers of our products and technology are primarily agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending. However, individual U.S. government agencies, which include the military services, NASA, MDA, and the prime contractors that serve these agencies, exercise independent purchasing power within \"budget top-line\" limits. Therefore, sales to the U.S. government are not regarded as sales to one customer, but rather each contracting agency is viewed as a separate customer.\nThe following table summarizes end user net sales to the U.S. government and its agencies, including net sales to significant customers disclosed below: Table 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of Net\nSales </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes net sales by principal end user in 2020:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASA </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MDA </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Army </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Air Force </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Navy </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other U.S. government </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. government customers </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other customers </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the percentages of net sales for significant programs, all of which are included in the U.S. government sales and are comprised of multiple contracts:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RS-25 program </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard Missile program </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>THAAD program </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PAC-3 program </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes customers that represented more than 10% of net sales, each of which involves sales of several product lines and programs: Table 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lockheed Martin </td> <td>34 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASA </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Raytheon </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ULA </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________\n* Less than 10%\nIndustry Update\nInformation concerning our industry appears in Part I, Item 1. Business under the caption \"Industry Overview.\"\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. See Notes 8(b) and 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report and \"Environmental Matters\" below for summary of our environmental reserve activity.\nCapital Structure\nWe have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of December 31, 2020, we had $624.3 million of debt outstanding.\nPension Plan\nAs of the last measurement date at December 31, 2020, the pension assets, projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation were $957.0 million, $1,381.5 million, and $424.5 million, respectively. We estimate that 82% of our unfunded pension obligation as of December 31, 2020, is related to our U.S. government contracting business, Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $94 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021. We generally are able to recover contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there are differences between when we contribute to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and when it is recoverable under CAS. Accordingly, in 2021, we expect to recover approximately $43 million of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan contributions as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have continued to cause significant economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets which could adversely impact the funded status of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. The funded status of our pension plan is impacted by the investment experience of the plan assets, by any changes in U.S. law, and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by the tax-qualified pension plan in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plan assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the Internal Revenue Service regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plan could be higher than we expect.\nCyber Security\nWe routinely defend against various cyber and other security threats against our defenses to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology infrastructure, supply chain, business or customer information and other threats. We are also subject to similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage as a contractual requirement.\nThe threats we face range from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, insider threats and other threat vectors targeting us and other defense and aerospace companies; because we protect national security information. In addition, cyber threats are evolving, growing in their frequency and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, destructive malware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, disruption or denial of service attacks, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential, personal or otherwise protected information (ours or that of our employees, customers or partners), and corruption of data, networks or systems. We also could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners' or customers' systems that are used in connection with our business.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where practicable, we have required employees to work remotely, and expanded our information technology and communication support to enhance their connectivity. We continue to assess our information technology systems and are engaged in cooperative efforts with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions.\nResults of Operations:\nNet Sales:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,072.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,981.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the RS-25, MRBM, and GMLRS programs partially offset by a decline on the Commercial Crew Development program and the cancellation in 2019 of the Redesigned Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (\"RKV\") program.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of items shown separately below):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,701.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,613.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales </td> <td>82.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>81.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by the following: (i) cost growth on a portion of the Standard Missile program in 2020; (ii) cost growth and performance issues in 2020 on the Commercial Crew Development program; and (iii) the reserve release upon the final AJ-60 solid rocket motor delivery in 2019. These factors were partially offset by improved performance and risk retirements on the RS-68, MRBM, and THAAD programs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense (\"SG&A\"): Table 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of SG&A: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A excluding stock-based compensation </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td>31.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales excluding stock-based compensation </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrimary reason for change.

Our effective tax rate differed from the 21% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, uncertain tax positions, and certain expenditures which are permanently not deductible for tax purposes, offset by R&D credits and excess tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the IRS released final regulations regarding the timing of income and inclusion under an accrual method of accounting. In accordance with the Applicable Financial Statement cost offset method described within the regulations, we recorded a $41.1 million reduction to our uncertain tax positions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $14.6 million. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.\nIn 2019, our effective tax rate was 26.5%. Our effective tax rate is higher than the 21% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and uncertain tax positions, offset by R&D credits and excess tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation.\nRetirement Benefits Expense: Table 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of retirement benefits expense: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on benefit obligation </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumed return on assets </td> <td>(60.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(64.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior service credits </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of net losses </td> <td>53.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefits expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in retirement benefits expense was primarily due to higher actuarial losses in the current period for the most part as a result of a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31, 2019, partially offset by lower interest costs on the benefit obligation.\nWe estimate that our retirement benefits expense will be approximately $34 million in 2021. Additionally, we estimate the CAS recoverable amounts related to the Company's retirement benefits plans to be approximately $45 million in 2021. See \"Critical Accounting Policies - Retirement Benefit Plans\" for more information about our accounting practices with respect to retirement benefits.\nOperating Segment Information:\nWe evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment performance. Segment performance represents net sales less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are: corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding our operational performance.\nAerospace and Defense Segment\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions, except percentage amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,069.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,974.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment performance </td> <td>275.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment margin </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the RS-25, MRBM, and GMLRS programs partially offset by a decline on the Commercial Crew Development program and the cancellation in 2019 of the RKV program.\nThe decrease in segment margin was primarily driven by the following: (i) cost growth on a portion of the Standard Missile program in 2020; (ii) cost growth and performance issues in 2020 on the Commercial Crew Development program; (iii) the reserve release upon the final AJ-60 solid rocket motor delivery in 2019; and (iv) higher retirement benefit expense. These factors were partially offset by (i) improved performance and risk retirements on the RS-68, MRBM, and THAAD programs and (ii) lower depreciation expense.\nDuring 2020, we had $45.1 million of net favorable changes in contract estimates on operating results before income taxes compared with net favorable changes of $38.4 million during 2019.\nReal Estate Segment\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment performance </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrimary reason for change.

The increase in backlog was due to a $1.8 billion contract modification for the production of an additional 18 RS-25 engines to support future deep space exploration missions. We expect to recognize approximately 32%, or $2.2 billion, of the remaining performance obligations as sales over the next twelve months, an additional\n24% the following twelve months, and 44% thereafter.

We use these metrics to measure our operating and total Company performance. We believe that for management and investors to effectively compare core performance from period to period, the metrics should exclude items that are not indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations such as retirement benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of our business. Accordingly, we define Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP net income adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts, and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS exclude retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income or diluted EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td>

measure of Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to cash flows from operations presented in accordance with GAAP. We use Free Cash Flow, both in presenting our results to stakeholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. Management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it provides supplemental information to assist them in viewing the business using the same tools that management uses to evaluate progress in achieving our goals. The following table summarizes Free Cash Flow: Table 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>363.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td>(54.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow </td> <td>$ </td> <td>309.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause our method for calculating these Non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies' methods, the Non-GAAP measures presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. These measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, and we do not intend for this information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures.\nEnvironmental Matters:\nOur policy is to conduct our businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We devote a significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental matters and actively manage our ongoing processes to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We are involved in the remediation of environmental conditions that resulted from generally accepted manufacturing and disposal practices at certain plants in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, we have been designated a PRP with other companies at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.\nEstimating environmental remediation costs is difficult due to the significant uncertainties inherent in these activities, including the extent of remediation required, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, evolving technologies and the long period of time over which most remediation efforts take place. We:\n\u2022accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and when our proportionate share of the costs can be reasonably estimated; and\n\u2022record related estimated recoveries when such recoveries are deemed probable.\nIn addition to the costs associated with environmental remediation discussed above, we incur expenditures for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances or pollutants in ongoing operations which totaled $6.0 million and $5.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes our recoverable amounts, environmental reserves, and range of liability, as of December 31, 2020: Table 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Recoverable\nAmount (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Reserve </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Range\nof Liability </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerojet Rocketdyne - Sacramento </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>208.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$208.4 - $331.4 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerojet Rocketdyne - Baldwin Park Operable Unit (\"BPOU\") </td> <td>67.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.2 - 91.9 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Aerojet Rocketdyne sites </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 - 21.1 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other sites </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 - 6.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>300.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$300.6 - $451.1 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____\n(1)Excludes the receivable from Northrop of $46.5 million as of December 31, 2020, related to environmental costs already paid (and therefore not reserved) by us in prior years and reimbursable under our agreement with Northrop.\nEnvironmental Reserves\nWe review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs and have an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. Environmental liabilities at the BPOU site are currently estimated through the term of the project agreement, which expires in May 2027. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs lengthens, the reliability of such estimates decreases. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate and revise these estimates as new\ninformation becomes available. We cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors, such as the regulatory approval process and the time required designing, constructing, and implementing the remedy.\nThe following table summarizes our environmental reserve activity: Table 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>309.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>327.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions </td> <td>32.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditures </td> <td>(41.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>300.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>309.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $32.4 million of environmental reserve additions in 2020 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $13.7 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (ii) $10.2 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (iii) $3.2 million of sampling analysis costs; and (iv) $5.3 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe $16.7 million of environmental reserve additions in 2019 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $10.0 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.1 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iii) $1.9 million of sampling analysis costs; and (iv) $0.7 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nThe effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. We continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from our insurance carriers and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.\nEstimated Recoveries\nEnvironmental remediation costs are primarily incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are recoverable from our contracts with the U.S. government. We currently estimate approximately 12% of our future Aerospace and Defense segment environmental remediation costs will not likely be reimbursable and are expensed.\nAllowable environmental remediation costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojet Rocketdyne's sustained business volume from U.S. government contracts and programs.\nWhile we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Global Settlement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the current and non-current recoverable amounts from the U.S. government and Northrop: Table 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>322.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions </td> <td>28.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reimbursements </td> <td>(36.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments </td> <td>(6.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>308.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>322.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe activity for recoveries is commensurate with the activity associated with the environmental reserve activity.\nEnvironmental reserves and recoveries impact on the consolidated statements of operations\nThe expenses associated with adjustments to the environmental reserves are recorded as a component of other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

The increase in capital expenditures in 2020 was primarily due to capacity expansion to support the RS-25 program.\nDuring 2020, we made a net investment of $6.7 million in marketable securities.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nDuring 2020 and 2019, we had debt cash payments of $21.7 million and $20.8 million, respectively. See a summary of the 2020 debt principal activity below. During 2020, we repurchased 1.3 million of our common shares at a cost of $51.7 million Additionally, we had net cash usage of $12.5 million in 2020 associated with our equity plans compared with net cash usage of $3.3 million in 2019.\nDebt Activity\nThe following table summarizes our debt principal activity: Table 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash\nPayments </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan </td> <td>$ </td> <td>328.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>308.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 1/4% Notes\n</td> <td>300.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases </td> <td>47.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt Activity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>675.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>654.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutlook\nShort-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, including but not limited to costs related to our capital and environmental expenditures, company-funded R&D expenditures, debt service requirements, and retirement benefit plans. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under the Senior Credit Facility coupled with cash generated from our future operations will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating plan for the next twelve months. The operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses, including interest and debt payments. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,149.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as well as $622.4 million of available borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Based on our existing debt agreements, we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2020. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived by the lenders, could result in the acceleration of the Senior Credit Facility and 2\u00bc% Notes. In addition, our failure to pay principal and interest when due is a default under the Senior Credit Facility, and in certain cases, would cause a cross default on the 2\u00bc% Notes.\nWe are committed to a cash management strategy that maintains liquidity to adequately support the operation of the business, our growth strategy, as well as to withstand unanticipated business volatility, including any impact arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our cash management strategy includes maintaining the flexibility to pay down debt and/or repurchase shares depending on economic and other conditions. In connection with the implementation of our cash management strategy, our management may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise if we believe that it is in our best interests.\nSuch repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are not permitted to pay cash dividends during the Pre-Closing Period (as defined therein), other than the pre-closing dividend approved by the Board of Directors on December 19, 2020.\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative impacts that it is having on the global economy and U.S. companies. The CARES Act includes various financial measures to assist companies, including temporary changes to income and non-income-based tax laws. Through these provisions, as of December 31, 2020, we have delayed $21.4 million of payroll tax payments. Additionally, in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act, we accelerated depreciation on qualified improvement property placed in service after December 31, 2017 for income tax purposes.\nIn light of the pending Merger, we do not expect to pursue strategic acquisitions at this time. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, we would expect to consider exploring possible strategic acquisitions. Potential future business acquisitions depend, in part, on the availability of financial resources at an acceptable cost of capital. We expect to utilize cash on hand and cash generated by operations, as well as cash available under our Senior Credit Facility, which may involve renegotiation of credit limits to finance any future acquisitions. Other sources of capital could include the issuance of common and/or preferred stock, the placement of debt, or combination of both. We periodically evaluate capital markets and may access such markets when circumstances appear favorable. We believe that sufficient capital resources will be available from one or several of these sources to finance any future acquisitions. However, no assurances can be made that acceptable financing will be available, or that acceptable acquisition candidates will be identified, or that any such acquisitions will be accretive to earnings.\nOn March 13, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized and approved a new share repurchase program allowing us to repurchase our outstanding common stock with an aggregate market value of up to $100 million over a period of up to 18 months; however, management has discretion as to whether any repurchases will be executed. The timing of any share repurchases will be based on available liquidity, cash flows and general market conditions. The repurchase program may be executed through various methods, including open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. During 2020, we repurchased 1.3 million of our common shares at a cost of $51.7 million which leaves $48.3 million of market value remaining for repurchase under the program at management's discretion.\nAs disclosed in Notes 8(a) and 8(b) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, we have exposure for certain legal and environmental matters. We believe that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of certain of these matters will have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nMajor factors that could adversely impact our forecasted operating cash flows and our financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition, our liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates.\nContractual Obligations:\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of debt obligations, operating leases, certain other liabilities, and other commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020: Table 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td>After\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Long-term debt: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Senior debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>308.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>282.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Convertible senior notes (1) </td> <td>300.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Finance lease obligations </td> <td>45.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest on long-term debt (2) </td> <td>63.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Postretirement medical and life insurance benefits (3) </td> <td>21.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating leases </td> <td>56.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>1,352.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>863.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>485.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Conditional asset retirement obligations (5) </td> <td>51.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,198.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,225.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>844.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________\n(1) Holders may convert their 2\u00bc% Notes at their option from January 1, 2021, through March 31, 2021, because our closing stock price exceeded $33.80 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period prior to December 31, 2020. We have a stated intention to cash settle the principal amount of the 2\u00bc% Notes with the conversion premium to be settled in common shares. Accordingly, the 2\u00bc% Notes are classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2020. See Notes 6 and 15 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\n(2) Includes interest on variable debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2020.\n(3) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for postretirement medical and life insurance benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. The obligation related to postretirement medical and life insurance benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. A substantial portion of these amounts are recoverable through our contracts with the U.S. government.\n(4) Purchase obligations represent open purchase orders and other commitments to suppliers, subcontractors, and other outsourcing partners for equipment, materials, and supplies in the normal course of business. These amounts are based on volumes consistent with anticipated requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from customers. A substantial portion of these amounts are recoverable through our contracts with the U.S. government.\n(5) The conditional asset retirement obligations presented are related to our Aerospace and Defense segment and are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government.\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $94 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021. We generally are able to recover contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there can be differences between when we contribute to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recover it under CAS.\nArrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk:\nSee Note 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for information relating to our off-balance sheet risk.\nCritical Accounting Policies:\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that offer acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain items affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, and recognizing revenues.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Although we believe that the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively and, if significant, disclosed in notes of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe areas most affected by our accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition, other contract considerations, goodwill, retirement benefit plans, litigation, environmental remediation costs and recoveries, and income taxes. Except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our operating segments, these areas affect the financial results of our business segments.\nFor a discussion of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn our Aerospace and Defense segment, the majority of our revenue is earned from long-term contracts to design, develop, and manufacture aerospace and defense products, and provide related services, for our customers, including the U.S. government, major aerospace and defense prime contractors, and the commercial sector. Each customer contract defines our distinct performance obligations and the associated transaction price for each obligation. A contract may contain one or multiple performance obligations. In certain circumstances, multiple contracts with a customer are required to be combined in determining the distinct performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contracted transaction price to each performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling price, which represents the price at which we would sell the promised good or service separately to the customer. We determine the standalone selling price based upon the facts and circumstances of each obligated good or service. The majority of our contracts have no observable standalone selling price since the associated products and services are customized to customer specifications. As such, the standalone selling price generally reflects our forecast of the total cost to satisfy the performance obligation plus an appropriate profit margin.\nContract modifications are routine in the performance of our long-term contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct, and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.\nWe recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our aerospace and defense performance obligations are satisfied over time either as the service is provided, or as control transfers to the customer. Transfer of control is evidenced by our contractual right to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit on contracts with highly customized products that we have no alternative use for. We measure progress on substantially all our performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method, which we believe best depicts the transfer of control of goods and services to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, we record revenues based upon costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated cost at completion. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead, and general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.\nRecognition of revenue and profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to the total contract value, the total cost at completion, and the measurement of progress towards completion for each performance\nobligation. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated total contract value and total cost at completion for each performance obligation requires the use of significant judgment.\nThe contract value of long-term contracts may include variable consideration, such as incentives, awards, or penalties. The value of variable consideration is generally determined by contracted performance metrics, which may include targets for cost, performance, quality, and schedule. We include variable consideration in the transaction price for the respective performance obligation at either estimated value, or most likely amount to be earned, based upon our assessment of expected performance. We record these amounts only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\nWe evaluate the contract value and cost estimates for performance obligations at least quarterly and more frequently when circumstances significantly change. Factors considered in estimating the work to be completed include, but are not limited to: labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of the work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, warranty costs, volume assumptions, anticipated labor agreements, inflationary trends, schedule and performance delays, availability of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of costs incurred outside the original contract included in any estimates to complete. When our estimate of total costs to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation exceeds the expected revenue, we recognize the loss immediately. When we determine that a change in estimates has an impact on the associated profit of a performance obligation, we record the cumulative positive or negative adjustment to the statement of operations. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to the status of certain long-term contracts may have a material effect on our operating results. The following table summarizes the impact of the changes in significant contract accounting estimates on our Aerospace and Defense segment operating results:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions, except per share amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on income before income taxes </td> <td>45.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on net income </td> <td>34.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on basic EPS </td> <td>0.44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Favorable effect of the changes in contract estimates on diluted EPS </td> <td>0.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nOther Contract Considerations\nThe majority of Aerospace and Defense segment sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products and perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR and CAS. The FAR and CAS provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable and allocable in establishing prices for goods and services from U.S. government contracts. For example, costs such as charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters.\nWe closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. We review the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the DCAA. Accordingly, we record an allowance on our unbilled receivables for amounts of potential contract overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and collected.\nRetirement Benefit Plans\nWe discontinued future benefit accruals for our defined benefit pension plans in 2009. We provide medical and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans, including interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. We also sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.\nRetirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimates. We generally are able to recover cash contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there is a lag between when we contribute cash to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recover it under our U.S. government contracts. Our pension and medical and life insurance benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts in accordance with GAAP. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine the retirement benefit obligations and expense (income) for the year.\nThe following table presents the assumptions to determine the benefit obligations: Table 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Pension\nBenefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Medical and\nLife Insurance Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td>2.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents the assumptions to determine the retirement benefits expense (income):\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Pension Benefits </td> <td> </td> <td>Medical and\nLife Insurance Benefits </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td>3.28 % </td> <td> </td> <td>4.27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.19 % </td> <td> </td> <td>4.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return on assets </td> <td>7.00 % </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____\n* Not applicable as our medical and life insurance benefits are unfunded.\nThe discount rate represents the current market interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations. Based on market conditions, discount rates can experience significant variability. Changes in discount rates can significantly change the liability and, accordingly, the funded status of the pension plan. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched to the expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life insurance benefit plans.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. We evaluated the historical investment performance, current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from our external advisors, developed best estimates of future investment performance.\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This \"smoothing\" results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be amortized to pension costs in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual pension costs, future pension costs are impacted by changes in the market value of assets and changes in interest rates.\nThe following table summarizes the effects of a one-percentage-point change in key assumptions on the projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020, and on retirement benefits expense for 2020:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Pension Benefits and\nMedical and Life Insurance Benefits Discount Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Long-term\nRate of Return\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Assumed Healthcare\nCost Trend Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Periodic\nBenefit Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Projected\nBenefit\nObligation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Periodic Pension\nBenefit Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Periodic\nMedical and Life\nInsurance Benefit Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Accumulated\nBenefit\nObligation </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease </td> <td>$18.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$150.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$8.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>$(0.1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$(0.3) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase </td> <td>(15.7) </td> <td> </td> <td>(126.0) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.7) </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEnvironmental Reserves and Estimated Recoveries\nFor a discussion of our accounting for environmental remediation obligations and costs and related legal matters, see \"Environmental Matters\" above and Notes 8(b) and 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nWe accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred, and when our costs can be reasonably estimated. In most cases, only a range of reasonably probable costs can be estimated. In establishing the reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Environmental reserves include the costs of completing remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions, regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates\nare based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible parties will be able to fulfill their commitments at sites where we may be jointly or severally liable.\nAt the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some of our environmental costs are eligible for future recovery in the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government and under existing third party agreements. We consider the recovery probable based on the Global Settlement, U.S. government contracting regulations, and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for the Company and our 100% owned consolidated subsidiaries. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including our past and future performance, the market environment in which we operate, the utilization of tax attributes in the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.\nWe believe that certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or a partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. Our tax reserves reflect the difference between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The accounting standards provide guidance for the recognition and measurement in financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. As the examination process progresses with tax authorities, adjustments to tax reserves may be necessary to reflect taxes payable upon settlement. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes.

Our effective tax rate differed from the 21% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, uncertain tax positions, and certain expenditures which are permanently not deductible for tax purposes, offset by R&D credits and excess tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation.\nShort-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, including but not limited to costs related to our capital and environmental expenditures, company-funded R&D expenditures, debt service requirements, and retirement benefit plans. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under the Senior Credit Facility coupled with cash generated from our future operations will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating plan for the next twelve months. The operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses, including interest and debt payments. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,149.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as well as $622.4 million of available borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Based on our existing debt agreements, we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2020. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived by the lenders, could result in the acceleration of the Senior Credit Facility and 2\u00bc% Notes. In addition, our failure to pay principal and interest when due is a default under the Senior Credit Facility, and in certain cases, would cause a cross default on the 2\u00bc% Notes.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>363.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td>(54.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow </td> <td>$ </td> <td>309.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and Amortization:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASA </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MDA </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Army </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Air Force </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Navy </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other U.S. government </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. government customers </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other customers </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2020, we made a net investment of $6.7 million in marketable securities.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In billions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded backlog </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded backlog </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total backlog </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs disclosed in Notes 8(a) and 8(b) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, we have exposure for certain legal and environmental matters.

The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched to the expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life insurance benefit plans.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions, except percentage and per share amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,072.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,981.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>137.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income as a percentage of net sales </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP measure*) </td> <td>138.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP measure*) as a percentage of net sales </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\") - Diluted </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP measure*) </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) </td> <td>270.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) as a percentage of net sales </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>363.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>261.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure*) </td> <td>309.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to cash flows from operations presented in accordance with GAAP. We use Free Cash Flow, both in presenting our results to stakeholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. Management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it provides supplemental information to assist them in viewing the business using the same tools that management uses to evaluate progress in achieving our goals.

Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This \"smoothing\" results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be amortized to pension costs in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual pension costs, future pension costs are impacted by changes in the market value of assets and changes in interest rates.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income: </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe provide the Non-GAAP financial measures of our performance called Adjusted EBITDAP, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS. We use these metrics to measure our operating and total Company performance. We believe that for management and investors to effectively compare core performance from period to period, the metrics should exclude items that are not indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations such as retirement benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of our business. Accordingly, we define Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP net income adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts, and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS exclude retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income or diluted EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>309.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>327.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions </td> <td>32.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditures </td> <td>(41.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>300.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>309.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash\nPayments </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan </td> <td>$ </td> <td>328.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>308.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 1/4% Notes\n</td> <td>300.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases </td> <td>47.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt Activity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>675.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>654.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for information relating to our off-balance sheet risk.\n\nOther Expense, Net: \nThe $102.6 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to the following: (i) improved cash flow from contracts due to the timing of customer advances; and (ii) a decrease in income (net of refunds) and payroll tax payments.\nIn light of the pending Merger, we do not expect to pursue strategic acquisitions at this time. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, we would expect to consider exploring possible strategic acquisitions. Potential future business acquisitions depend, in part, on the availability of financial resources at an acceptable cost of capital. We expect to utilize cash on hand and cash generated by operations, as well as cash available under our Senior Credit Facility, which may involve renegotiation of credit limits to finance any future acquisitions. Other sources of capital could include the issuance of common and/or preferred stock, the placement of debt, or combination of both. We periodically evaluate capital markets and may access such markets when circumstances appear favorable. We believe that sufficient capital resources will be available from one or several of these sources to finance any future acquisitions. However, no assurances can be made that acceptable financing will be available, or that acceptable acquisition candidates will be identified, or that any such acquisitions will be accretive to earnings.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lockheed Martin </td> <td>34 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASA </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Raytheon </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ULA </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense to consolidated statement of operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the current and non-current recoverable amounts from the U.S. government and Northrop: \nArrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Pension Benefits </td> <td> </td> <td>Medical and\nLife Insurance Benefits </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td>3.28 % </td> <td> </td> <td>4.27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.19 % </td> <td> </td> <td>4.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return on assets </td> <td>7.00 % </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled $6.7 billion, compared with $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2019.

Directors authorized and approved a new share repurchase program allowing us to repurchase our outstanding common stock with an aggregate market value of up to $100 million over a period of up to 18 months; however, management has discretion as to whether any repurchases will be executed. The timing of any share repurchases will be based on available liquidity, cash flows and general market conditions. The repurchase program may be executed through various methods, including open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. During 2020, we repurchased 1.3 million of our common shares at a cost of $51.7 million which leaves $48.3 million of market value remaining for repurchase under the program at management's discretion.\nobligation. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated total contract value and total cost at completion for each performance obligation requires the use of significant judgment.\n* Not applicable as our medical and life insurance benefits are unfunded.\n____\n\nClosing of the Merger is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2021, subject to various customary conditions, including our stockholder approval and regulatory approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.\nRetirement Benefits Expense: \n(3) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for postretirement medical and life insurance benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. The obligation related to postretirement medical and life insurance benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. A substantial portion of these amounts are recoverable through our contracts with the U.S. government.\n\nOur policy is to conduct our businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We devote a significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental matters and actively manage our ongoing processes to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We are involved in the remediation of environmental conditions that resulted from generally accepted manufacturing and disposal practices at certain plants in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, we have been designated a PRP with other companies at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.\nIndustry Update\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in retirement benefits expense was primarily due to higher actuarial losses in the current period for the most part as a result of a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31, 2019, partially offset by lower interest costs on the benefit obligation.\nThe majority of Aerospace and Defense segment sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products and perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR and CAS. The FAR and CAS provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable and allocable in establishing prices for goods and services from U.S. government contracts. For example, costs such as charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters.\n24% the following twelve months, and 44% thereafter. The following table summarizes backlog: \nAs a defense industrial-base U.S. government contractor, we are considered an essential business by the U.S. and state governments and we continue to operate as such during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are taking a variety of measures to maintain the availability and functionality of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees and to support the communities in which we operate. In making decisions regarding our operations, we take into account public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the adoption of mask-wearing protocols, enhanced cleaning protocols and health monitoring, as well as the imposition of travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing, and the adoption of work-from-home requirements for employees where practicable. All of these policies and initiatives could impact our operations. Due to the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, corresponding U.S. government policies and the uncertainty relating to the rollout and timing of vaccines, we are not able at this time to estimate its full impact on our financial results and operations.\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the RS-25, MRBM, and GMLRS programs partially offset by a decline on the Commercial Crew Development program and the cancellation in 2019 of the RKV program.\nThe following table summarizes end user net sales to the U.S. government and its agencies, including net sales to significant customers disclosed below: \nPrimary reason for change. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by the following: (i) cost growth on a portion of the Standard Missile program in 2020; (ii) cost growth and performance issues in 2020 on the Commercial Crew Development program; and (iii) the reserve release upon the final AJ-60 solid rocket motor delivery in 2019. These factors were partially offset by improved performance and risk retirements on the RS-68, MRBM, and THAAD programs.\n(1)Excludes the receivable from Northrop of $46.5 million as of December 31, 2020, related to environmental costs already paid (and therefore not reserved) by us in prior years and reimbursable under our agreement with Northrop.\nOn December 19, 2020, our Board of Directors declared the one-time Pre-Closing Dividend in cash of $5.00 per share (including shares underlying the 2\u00bc% Notes participating on an as-converted basis). The Pre-Closing Dividend is payable on March 24, 2021, to the holders of our shares and 2\u00bc% Notes as of the close of business on March 10, 2021. The $56.00 per share price under the Merger Agreement is expected to be reduced to $51.00 after the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend to our stockholders and holders of our 2\u00bc% Notes participating on an as-converted basis (or, in the unlikely event that closing occurs after March 10, 2021, but before March 24, 2021, to the extent the Pre-Closing Dividend is payable after the closing).\nPrimary reason for change. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the completion of depreciation expense associated with the enterprise resource planning system which was placed into service in June 2013.\nWe review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs and have an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. Environmental liabilities at the BPOU site are currently estimated through the term of the project agreement, which expires in May 2027. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs lengthens, the reliability of such estimates decreases. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate and revise these estimates as new\nOutlook\nEstimating environmental remediation costs is difficult due to the significant uncertainties inherent in these activities, including the extent of remediation required, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, evolving technologies and the long period of time over which most remediation efforts take place. We:\n(2) Includes interest on variable debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2020.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring 2020 and 2019, we had debt cash payments of $21.7 million and $20.8 million, respectively. See a summary of the 2020 debt principal activity below. During 2020, we repurchased 1.3 million of our common shares at a cost of $51.7 million Additionally, we had net cash usage of $12.5 million in 2020 associated with our equity plans compared with net cash usage of $3.3 million in 2019.\nWe evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment performance. Segment performance represents net sales less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are: corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding our operational performance.\nDebt Activity\nCritical Accounting Policies:\nIncome Tax Provision: \nWe estimate that our retirement benefits expense will be approximately $34 million in 2021. Additionally, we estimate the CAS recoverable amounts related to the Company's retirement benefits plans to be approximately $45 million in 2021. See \"Critical Accounting Policies - Retirement Benefit Plans\" for more information about our accounting practices with respect to retirement benefits.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. We evaluated the historical investment performance, current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from our external advisors, developed best estimates of future investment performance.\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nWe discontinued future benefit accruals for our defined benefit pension plans in 2009. We provide medical and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans, including interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. We also sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.\nRecognition of revenue and profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to the total contract value, the total cost at completion, and the measurement of progress towards completion for each performance\ninformation becomes available. We cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors, such as the regulatory approval process and the time required designing, constructing, and implementing the remedy.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\n_____\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including our past and future performance, the market environment in which we operate, the utilization of tax attributes in the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.\nPrimary reason for change. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower variable interest rates and average obligations on our Senior Credit Facility.\nRetirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimates. We generally are able to recover cash contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there is a lag between when we contribute cash to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recover it under our U.S. government contracts. Our pension and medical and life insurance benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts in accordance with GAAP. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine the retirement benefit obligations and expense (income) for the year.\nEnvironmental Matters:\nA summary of the significant financial highlights for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition, is presented below.\nThe principal end user customers of our products and technology are primarily agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending. However, individual U.S. government agencies, which include the military services, NASA, MDA, and the prime contractors that serve these agencies, exercise independent purchasing power within \"budget top-line\" limits. Therefore, sales to the U.S. government are not regarded as sales to one customer, but rather each contracting agency is viewed as a separate customer.\n\nFor a discussion of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn addition to the costs associated with environmental remediation discussed above, we incur expenditures for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances or pollutants in ongoing operations which totaled $6.0 million and $5.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $94 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021. We generally are able to recover contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there are differences between when we contribute to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and when it is recoverable under CAS. Accordingly, in 2021, we expect to recover approximately $43 million of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan contributions as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts.\nIn 2019, our effective tax rate was 26.5%. Our effective tax rate is higher than the 21% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and uncertain tax positions, offset by R&D credits and excess tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDAP, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS\n(1) The income tax impact is calculated using the federal and state statutory rates in the corresponding year.\nMajor factors that could adversely impact our forecasted operating cash flows and our financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition, our liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the IRS released final regulations regarding the timing of income and inclusion under an accrual method of accounting. In accordance with the Applicable Financial Statement cost offset method described within the regulations, we recorded a $41.1 million reduction to our uncertain tax positions.\nPrimary reason for change. Net sales consist primarily of rental property operations. The decrease in net sales and segment performance were driven primarily by delays in new tenant starts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Contract Considerations\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in other expense, net was primarily due to an increase of $7.8 million in unusual items primarily related to Merger costs. For detailed information about unusual expenses refer to Note 13 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense (\"SG&A\"): \nPrimary reason for change. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower market rates partially offset by higher average cash balances.\nThe following table presents the assumptions to determine the benefit obligations: \nThe following table summarizes our debt principal activity: \nEnvironmental Matters\nPension Plan\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where practicable, we have required employees to work remotely, and expanded our information technology and communication support to enhance their connectivity. We continue to assess our information technology systems and are engaged in cooperative efforts with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions.\n\n\nWhile we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Global Settlement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nDuring 2020, there was minimal adverse impact to our financial results and operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The safety and welfare of our employees remains our top priority, and throughout the year, we have continued to operate with our established safety protocols, which include selected and site-specific work and travel restrictions, in addition to other measures intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We have also continued to evaluate new opportunities to protect our employees. Although we have not experienced significant absenteeism or supply chain disruption, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our future financial results depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and the actions being taken to contain and treat it, including the distribution of a vaccine, and other indirect effects that may come as a result of actions taken by governments, companies, and individuals in response to the pandemic and its economic impact.\nThe following table summarizes net sales by principal end user in 2020:\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:\nAerospace and Defense Segment\n\nInterest Income:\nIn our Aerospace and Defense segment, the majority of our revenue is earned from long-term contracts to design, develop, and manufacture aerospace and defense products, and provide related services, for our customers, including the U.S. government, major aerospace and defense prime contractors, and the commercial sector. Each customer contract defines our distinct performance obligations and the associated transaction price for each obligation. A contract may contain one or multiple performance obligations. In certain circumstances, multiple contracts with a customer are required to be combined in determining the distinct performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contracted transaction price to each performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling price, which represents the price at which we would sell the promised good or service separately to the customer. We determine the standalone selling price based upon the facts and circumstances of each obligated good or service. The majority of our contracts have no observable standalone selling price since the associated products and services are customized to customer specifications. As such, the standalone selling price generally reflects our forecast of the total cost to satisfy the performance obligation plus an appropriate profit margin.\nEnvironmental reserves and recoveries impact on the consolidated statements of operations\n________\nOverview\nAs of the last measurement date at December 31, 2020, the pension assets, projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation were $957.0 million, $1,381.5 million, and $424.5 million, respectively. We estimate that 82% of our unfunded pension obligation as of December 31, 2020, is related to our U.S. government contracting business, Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that offer acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain items affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, and recognizing revenues.\nThe following table presents the assumptions to determine the retirement benefits expense (income):\nThe following table summarizes our environmental reserve activity: \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe threats we face range from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, insider threats and other threat vectors targeting us and other defense and aerospace companies; because we protect national security information. In addition, cyber threats are evolving, growing in their frequency and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, destructive malware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, disruption or denial of service attacks, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential, personal or otherwise protected information (ours or that of our employees, customers or partners), and corruption of data, networks or systems. We also could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners' or customers' systems that are used in connection with our business.\nThe decrease in segment margin was primarily driven by the following: (i) cost growth on a portion of the Standard Missile program in 2020; (ii) cost growth and performance issues in 2020 on the Commercial Crew Development program; (iii) the reserve release upon the final AJ-60 solid rocket motor delivery in 2019; and (iv) higher retirement benefit expense. These factors were partially offset by (i) improved performance and risk retirements on the RS-68, MRBM, and THAAD programs and (ii) lower depreciation expense.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Although we believe that the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively and, if significant, disclosed in notes of the consolidated financial statements.\nWe closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. We review the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the DCAA. Accordingly, we record an allowance on our unbilled receivables for amounts of potential contract overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and collected.\nSuch repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are not permitted to pay cash dividends during the Pre-Closing Period (as defined therein), other than the pre-closing dividend approved by the Board of Directors on December 19, 2020.\nThe areas most affected by our accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition, other contract considerations, goodwill, retirement benefit plans, litigation, environmental remediation costs and recoveries, and income taxes. Except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our operating segments, these areas affect the financial results of our business segments.\n _________\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative impacts that it is having on the global economy and U.S. companies. The CARES Act includes various financial measures to assist companies, including temporary changes to income and non-income-based tax laws. Through these provisions, as of December 31, 2020, we have delayed $21.4 million of payroll tax payments. Additionally, in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act, we accelerated depreciation on qualified improvement property placed in service after December 31, 2017 for income tax purposes.\nThe following table summarizes the percentages of net sales for significant programs, all of which are included in the U.S. government sales and are comprised of multiple contracts:\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily driven by stock-based compensation that was partially offset by a decrease in business travel-related expenses due to our restrictions on travel in response to COVID-19. For detailed information about stock-based compensation refer to Note 9(e) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\n\u2022record related estimated recoveries when such recoveries are deemed probable.\n* We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under the heading \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n* Less than 10%\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have continued to cause significant economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets which could adversely impact the funded status of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. The funded status of our pension plan is impacted by the investment experience of the plan assets, by any changes in U.S. law, and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by the tax-qualified pension plan in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plan assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the Internal Revenue Service regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plan could be higher than we expect.\nEnvironmental Reserves\nWe accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred, and when our costs can be reasonably estimated. In most cases, only a range of reasonably probable costs can be estimated. In establishing the reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Environmental reserves include the costs of completing remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions, regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nThe effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. We continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from our insurance carriers and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.\n\nTotal backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated). Indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog. Backlog is subject to funding delays or program restructurings/cancellations which are beyond our control.\nThe following table summarizes the effects of a one-percentage-point change in key assumptions on the projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020, and on retirement benefits expense for 2020:\nMajor Customers\nDuring 2020, we had $45.1 million of net favorable changes in contract estimates on operating results before income taxes compared with net favorable changes of $38.4 million during 2019.\nReal Estate Segment\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for the Company and our 100% owned consolidated subsidiaries. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.\nNet Sales:\n_________\nCOVID-19\nFor a discussion of our accounting for environmental remediation obligations and costs and related legal matters, see \"Environmental Matters\" above and Notes 8(b) and 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe expenses associated with adjustments to the environmental reserves are recorded as a component of other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the impact of environmental reserves and recoveries to the consolidated statements of operations: \nOur business outlook is affected by both increasing complexity in the global security environment and continuing worldwide economic pressures, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on protecting our employees' health and safety, delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.\nWe evaluate the contract value and cost estimates for performance obligations at least quarterly and more frequently when circumstances significantly change. Factors considered in estimating the work to be completed include, but are not limited to: labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of the work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, warranty costs, volume assumptions, anticipated labor agreements, inflationary trends, schedule and performance delays, availability of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of costs incurred outside the original contract included in any estimates to complete. When our estimate of total costs to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation exceeds the expected revenue, we recognize the loss immediately. When we determine that a change in estimates has an impact on the associated profit of a performance obligation, we record the cumulative positive or negative adjustment to the statement of operations. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to the status of certain long-term contracts may have a material effect on our operating results. The following table summarizes the impact of the changes in significant contract accounting estimates on our Aerospace and Defense segment operating results:\nEnvironmental Reserves and Estimated Recoveries\nCapital Structure\n(5) The conditional asset retirement obligations presented are related to our Aerospace and Defense segment and are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government.\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of debt obligations, operating leases, certain other liabilities, and other commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020: \nResults of Operations:\n(4) Purchase obligations represent open purchase orders and other commitments to suppliers, subcontractors, and other outsourcing partners for equipment, materials, and supplies in the normal course of business. These amounts are based on volumes consistent with anticipated requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from customers. A substantial portion of these amounts are recoverable through our contracts with the U.S. government.\nThe $16.7 million of environmental reserve additions in 2019 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $10.0 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.1 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iii) $1.9 million of sampling analysis costs; and (iv) $0.7 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nSee Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for information relating to our discussion of the effects of recent accounting pronouncements.\nWe recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our aerospace and defense performance obligations are satisfied over time either as the service is provided, or as control transfers to the customer. Transfer of control is evidenced by our contractual right to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit on contracts with highly customized products that we have no alternative use for. We measure progress on substantially all our performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method, which we believe best depicts the transfer of control of goods and services to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, we record revenues based upon costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated cost at completion. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead, and general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.\n(1) Holders may convert their 2\u00bc% Notes at their option from January 1, 2021, through March 31, 2021, because our closing stock price exceeded $33.80 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period prior to December 31, 2020. We have a stated intention to cash settle the principal amount of the 2\u00bc% Notes with the conversion premium to be settled in common shares. Accordingly, the 2\u00bc% Notes are classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2020. See Notes 6 and 15 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nOperating Segment Information:\nOur current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. See Notes 8(b) and 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report and \"Environmental Matters\" below for summary of our environmental reserve activity.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, we had capital expenditures of $54.6 million and $42.9 million, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2020 was primarily due to capacity expansion to support the RS-25 program.\nThe $32.4 million of environmental reserve additions in 2020 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $13.7 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (ii) $10.2 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (iii) $3.2 million of sampling analysis costs; and (iv) $5.3 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nWe believe that certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or a partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. Our tax reserves reflect the difference between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The accounting standards provide guidance for the recognition and measurement in financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. As the examination process progresses with tax authorities, adjustments to tax reserves may be necessary to reflect taxes payable upon settlement. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nContractual Obligations:", "item_7_text": "The activity for recoveries is commensurate with the activity associated with the environmental reserve activity.\nThe following table summarizes customers that represented more than 10% of net sales, each of which involves sales of several product lines and programs: \nSee Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $94 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021. We generally are able to recover contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there can be differences between when we contribute to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recover it under CAS.\nBecause our method for calculating these Non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies' methods, the Non-GAAP measures presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. These measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, and we do not intend for this information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures.\nIn 2020, our effective tax rate was 23.6%. Our effective tax rate differed from the 21% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, uncertain tax positions, and certain expenditures which are permanently not deductible for tax purposes, offset by R&D credits and excess tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation.\nShort-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, including but not limited to costs related to our capital and environmental expenditures, company-funded R&D expenditures, debt service requirements, and retirement benefit plans. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under the Senior Credit Facility coupled with cash generated from our future operations will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating plan for the next twelve months. The operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses, including interest and debt payments. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,149.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as well as $622.4 million of available borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Based on our existing debt agreements, we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2020. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived by the lenders, could result in the acceleration of the Senior Credit Facility and 2\u00bc% Notes. In addition, our failure to pay principal and interest when due is a default under the Senior Credit Facility, and in certain cases, would cause a cross default on the 2\u00bc% Notes.\nDepreciation and Amortization:\nDuring 2020, we made a net investment of $6.7 million in marketable securities.\nAs disclosed in Notes 8(a) and 8(b) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, we have exposure for certain legal and environmental matters. We believe that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of certain of these matters will have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIncome Taxes\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the RS-25, MRBM, and GMLRS programs partially offset by a decline on the Commercial Crew Development program and the cancellation in 2019 of the Redesigned Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (\"RKV\") program.\nThe contract value of long-term contracts may include variable consideration, such as incentives, awards, or penalties. The value of variable consideration is generally determined by contracted performance metrics, which may include targets for cost, performance, quality, and schedule. We include variable consideration in the transaction price for the respective performance obligation at either estimated value, or most likely amount to be earned, based upon our assessment of expected performance. We record these amounts only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe routinely defend against various cyber and other security threats against our defenses to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology infrastructure, supply chain, business or customer information and other threats. We are also subject to similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage as a contractual requirement.\nWe are committed to a cash management strategy that maintains liquidity to adequately support the operation of the business, our growth strategy, as well as to withstand unanticipated business volatility, including any impact arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our cash management strategy includes maintaining the flexibility to pay down debt and/or repurchase shares depending on economic and other conditions. In connection with the implementation of our cash management strategy, our management may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise if we believe that it is in our best interests.\nThe discount rate represents the current market interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations. Based on market conditions, discount rates can experience significant variability. Changes in discount rates can significantly change the liability and, accordingly, the funded status of the pension plan. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched to the expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life insurance benefit plans.\nWe also provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to cash flows from operations presented in accordance with GAAP. We use Free Cash Flow, both in presenting our results to stakeholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. Management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it provides supplemental information to assist them in viewing the business using the same tools that management uses to evaluate progress in achieving our goals. The following table summarizes Free Cash Flow: \nThe following table summarizes the change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash:\nInformation concerning our industry appears in Part I, Item 1. Business under the caption \"Industry Overview.\"\nEstimated Recoveries\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This \"smoothing\" results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be amortized to pension costs in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual pension costs, future pension costs are impacted by changes in the market value of assets and changes in interest rates.\nWe provide the Non-GAAP financial measures of our performance called Adjusted EBITDAP, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS. We use these metrics to measure our operating and total Company performance. We believe that for management and investors to effectively compare core performance from period to period, the metrics should exclude items that are not indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations such as retirement benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of our business. Accordingly, we define Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP net income adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts, and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS exclude retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under our U.S. government contracts and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income or diluted EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.\n________\nSee Note 8(d) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for information relating to our off-balance sheet risk.\n\nOther Expense, Net: \nThe $102.6 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to the following: (i) improved cash flow from contracts due to the timing of customer advances; and (ii) a decrease in income (net of refunds) and payroll tax payments.\nIn light of the pending Merger, we do not expect to pursue strategic acquisitions at this time. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, we would expect to consider exploring possible strategic acquisitions. Potential future business acquisitions depend, in part, on the availability of financial resources at an acceptable cost of capital. We expect to utilize cash on hand and cash generated by operations, as well as cash available under our Senior Credit Facility, which may involve renegotiation of credit limits to finance any future acquisitions. Other sources of capital could include the issuance of common and/or preferred stock, the placement of debt, or combination of both. We periodically evaluate capital markets and may access such markets when circumstances appear favorable. We believe that sufficient capital resources will be available from one or several of these sources to finance any future acquisitions. However, no assurances can be made that acceptable financing will be available, or that acceptable acquisition candidates will be identified, or that any such acquisitions will be accretive to earnings.\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the current and non-current recoverable amounts from the U.S. government and Northrop: \nArrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk:\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled $6.7 billion, compared with $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in backlog was due to a $1.8 billion contract modification for the production of an additional 18 RS-25 engines to support future deep space exploration missions. We expect to recognize approximately 32%, or $2.2 billion, of the remaining performance obligations as sales over the next twelve months, an additional\nContract modifications are routine in the performance of our long-term contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct, and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of December 31, 2020, we had $624.3 million of debt outstanding.\nOn December 20, 2020, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Lockheed Martin and the Merger Sub, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin.\nSome of the significant challenges we face are as follows: uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments, companies, and individuals in response, including the distribution of a vaccine, dependence upon U.S. government programs and contracts, future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending in our markets, environmental matters, capital structure, underfunded pension plan, and cyber security.\n\nAllowable environmental remediation costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojet Rocketdyne's sustained business volume from U.S. government contracts and programs.\nare based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible parties will be able to fulfill their commitments at sites where we may be jointly or severally liable.\nAt the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some of our environmental costs are eligible for future recovery in the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government and under existing third party agreements. We consider the recovery probable based on the Global Settlement, U.S. government contracting regulations, and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of items shown separately below):\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $14.6 million. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.\n\u2022accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and when our proportionate share of the costs can be reasonably estimated; and\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\n\nBacklog:\nCyber Security\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $56.00 per share, without interest, less, to the extent paid or payable as outlined below, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (defined below).\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this Report, the risk factors appearing in Item 1A of this Report, and the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements appearing at the beginning of Item 1 of this Report. We have elected to omit discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by the consolidated financial statements presented. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2020, for the discussion of the year ended December 31, 2018, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented.\nRetirement Benefit Plans\nEnvironmental remediation costs are primarily incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are recoverable from our contracts with the U.S. government. We currently estimate approximately 12% of our future Aerospace and Defense segment environmental remediation costs will not likely be reimbursable and are expensed.\nThe following table summarizes our recoverable amounts, environmental reserves, and range of liability, as of December 31, 2020: \nOn March 13, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized and approved a new share repurchase program allowing us to repurchase our outstanding common stock with an aggregate market value of up to $100 million over a period of up to 18 months; however, management has discretion as to whether any repurchases will be executed. The timing of any share repurchases will be based on available liquidity, cash flows and general market conditions. The repurchase program may be executed through various methods, including open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. During 2020, we repurchased 1.3 million of our common shares at a cost of $51.7 million which leaves $48.3 million of market value remaining for repurchase under the program at management's discretion.\nobligation. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated total contract value and total cost at completion for each performance obligation requires the use of significant judgment.\n* Not applicable as our medical and life insurance benefits are unfunded.\n____\n\nClosing of the Merger is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2021, subject to various customary conditions, including our stockholder approval and regulatory approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.\nRetirement Benefits Expense: \n(3) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for postretirement medical and life insurance benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. The obligation related to postretirement medical and life insurance benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. A substantial portion of these amounts are recoverable through our contracts with the U.S. government.\n\nOur policy is to conduct our businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We devote a significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental matters and actively manage our ongoing processes to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We are involved in the remediation of environmental conditions that resulted from generally accepted manufacturing and disposal practices at certain plants in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, we have been designated a PRP with other companies at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.\nIndustry Update\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in retirement benefits expense was primarily due to higher actuarial losses in the current period for the most part as a result of a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31, 2019, partially offset by lower interest costs on the benefit obligation.\nThe majority of Aerospace and Defense segment sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products and perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR and CAS. The FAR and CAS provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable and allocable in establishing prices for goods and services from U.S. government contracts. For example, costs such as charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters.\n24% the following twelve months, and 44% thereafter. The following table summarizes backlog: \nAs a defense industrial-base U.S. government contractor, we are considered an essential business by the U.S. and state governments and we continue to operate as such during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are taking a variety of measures to maintain the availability and functionality of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees and to support the communities in which we operate. In making decisions regarding our operations, we take into account public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the adoption of mask-wearing protocols, enhanced cleaning protocols and health monitoring, as well as the imposition of travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing, and the adoption of work-from-home requirements for employees where practicable. All of these policies and initiatives could impact our operations. Due to the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, corresponding U.S. government policies and the uncertainty relating to the rollout and timing of vaccines, we are not able at this time to estimate its full impact on our financial results and operations.\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the RS-25, MRBM, and GMLRS programs partially offset by a decline on the Commercial Crew Development program and the cancellation in 2019 of the RKV program.\nThe following table summarizes end user net sales to the U.S. government and its agencies, including net sales to significant customers disclosed below: \nPrimary reason for change. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by the following: (i) cost growth on a portion of the Standard Missile program in 2020; (ii) cost growth and performance issues in 2020 on the Commercial Crew Development program; and (iii) the reserve release upon the final AJ-60 solid rocket motor delivery in 2019. These factors were partially offset by improved performance and risk retirements on the RS-68, MRBM, and THAAD programs.\n(1)Excludes the receivable from Northrop of $46.5 million as of December 31, 2020, related to environmental costs already paid (and therefore not reserved) by us in prior years and reimbursable under our agreement with Northrop.\nOn December 19, 2020, our Board of Directors declared the one-time Pre-Closing Dividend in cash of $5.00 per share (including shares underlying the 2\u00bc% Notes participating on an as-converted basis). The Pre-Closing Dividend is payable on March 24, 2021, to the holders of our shares and 2\u00bc% Notes as of the close of business on March 10, 2021. The $56.00 per share price under the Merger Agreement is expected to be reduced to $51.00 after the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend to our stockholders and holders of our 2\u00bc% Notes participating on an as-converted basis (or, in the unlikely event that closing occurs after March 10, 2021, but before March 24, 2021, to the extent the Pre-Closing Dividend is payable after the closing).\nPrimary reason for change. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the completion of depreciation expense associated with the enterprise resource planning system which was placed into service in June 2013.\nWe review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs and have an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. Environmental liabilities at the BPOU site are currently estimated through the term of the project agreement, which expires in May 2027. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs lengthens, the reliability of such estimates decreases. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate and revise these estimates as new\nOutlook\nEstimating environmental remediation costs is difficult due to the significant uncertainties inherent in these activities, including the extent of remediation required, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, evolving technologies and the long period of time over which most remediation efforts take place. We:\n(2) Includes interest on variable debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2020.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring 2020 and 2019, we had debt cash payments of $21.7 million and $20.8 million, respectively. See a summary of the 2020 debt principal activity below. During 2020, we repurchased 1.3 million of our common shares at a cost of $51.7 million Additionally, we had net cash usage of $12.5 million in 2020 associated with our equity plans compared with net cash usage of $3.3 million in 2019.\nWe evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment performance. Segment performance represents net sales less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are: corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding our operational performance.\nDebt Activity\nCritical Accounting Policies:\nIncome Tax Provision: \nWe estimate that our retirement benefits expense will be approximately $34 million in 2021. Additionally, we estimate the CAS recoverable amounts related to the Company's retirement benefits plans to be approximately $45 million in 2021. See \"Critical Accounting Policies - Retirement Benefit Plans\" for more information about our accounting practices with respect to retirement benefits.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. We evaluated the historical investment performance, current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from our external advisors, developed best estimates of future investment performance.\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nWe discontinued future benefit accruals for our defined benefit pension plans in 2009. We provide medical and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans, including interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. We also sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.\nRecognition of revenue and profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to the total contract value, the total cost at completion, and the measurement of progress towards completion for each performance\ninformation becomes available. We cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors, such as the regulatory approval process and the time required designing, constructing, and implementing the remedy.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\n_____\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including our past and future performance, the market environment in which we operate, the utilization of tax attributes in the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.\nPrimary reason for change. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower variable interest rates and average obligations on our Senior Credit Facility.\nRetirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimates. We generally are able to recover cash contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there is a lag between when we contribute cash to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recover it under our U.S. government contracts. Our pension and medical and life insurance benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts in accordance with GAAP. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine the retirement benefit obligations and expense (income) for the year.\nEnvironmental Matters:\nA summary of the significant financial highlights for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition, is presented below.\nThe principal end user customers of our products and technology are primarily agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending. However, individual U.S. government agencies, which include the military services, NASA, MDA, and the prime contractors that serve these agencies, exercise independent purchasing power within \"budget top-line\" limits. Therefore, sales to the U.S. government are not regarded as sales to one customer, but rather each contracting agency is viewed as a separate customer.\n\nFor a discussion of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn addition to the costs associated with environmental remediation discussed above, we incur expenditures for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances or pollutants in ongoing operations which totaled $6.0 million and $5.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $94 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021. We generally are able to recover contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there are differences between when we contribute to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and when it is recoverable under CAS. Accordingly, in 2021, we expect to recover approximately $43 million of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan contributions as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts.\nIn 2019, our effective tax rate was 26.5%. Our effective tax rate is higher than the 21% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and uncertain tax positions, offset by R&D credits and excess tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDAP, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS\n(1) The income tax impact is calculated using the federal and state statutory rates in the corresponding year.\nMajor factors that could adversely impact our forecasted operating cash flows and our financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition, our liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the IRS released final regulations regarding the timing of income and inclusion under an accrual method of accounting. In accordance with the Applicable Financial Statement cost offset method described within the regulations, we recorded a $41.1 million reduction to our uncertain tax positions.\nPrimary reason for change. Net sales consist primarily of rental property operations. The decrease in net sales and segment performance were driven primarily by delays in new tenant starts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Contract Considerations\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in other expense, net was primarily due to an increase of $7.8 million in unusual items primarily related to Merger costs. For detailed information about unusual expenses refer to Note 13 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense (\"SG&A\"): \nPrimary reason for change. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower market rates partially offset by higher average cash balances.\nThe following table presents the assumptions to determine the benefit obligations: \nThe following table summarizes our debt principal activity: \nEnvironmental Matters\nPension Plan\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where practicable, we have required employees to work remotely, and expanded our information technology and communication support to enhance their connectivity. We continue to assess our information technology systems and are engaged in cooperative efforts with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions.\n\n\nWhile we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Global Settlement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nDuring 2020, there was minimal adverse impact to our financial results and operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The safety and welfare of our employees remains our top priority, and throughout the year, we have continued to operate with our established safety protocols, which include selected and site-specific work and travel restrictions, in addition to other measures intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We have also continued to evaluate new opportunities to protect our employees. Although we have not experienced significant absenteeism or supply chain disruption, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our future financial results depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and the actions being taken to contain and treat it, including the distribution of a vaccine, and other indirect effects that may come as a result of actions taken by governments, companies, and individuals in response to the pandemic and its economic impact.\nThe following table summarizes net sales by principal end user in 2020:\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:\nAerospace and Defense Segment\n\nInterest Income:\nIn our Aerospace and Defense segment, the majority of our revenue is earned from long-term contracts to design, develop, and manufacture aerospace and defense products, and provide related services, for our customers, including the U.S. government, major aerospace and defense prime contractors, and the commercial sector. Each customer contract defines our distinct performance obligations and the associated transaction price for each obligation. A contract may contain one or multiple performance obligations. In certain circumstances, multiple contracts with a customer are required to be combined in determining the distinct performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contracted transaction price to each performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling price, which represents the price at which we would sell the promised good or service separately to the customer. We determine the standalone selling price based upon the facts and circumstances of each obligated good or service. The majority of our contracts have no observable standalone selling price since the associated products and services are customized to customer specifications. As such, the standalone selling price generally reflects our forecast of the total cost to satisfy the performance obligation plus an appropriate profit margin.\nEnvironmental reserves and recoveries impact on the consolidated statements of operations\n________\nOverview\nAs of the last measurement date at December 31, 2020, the pension assets, projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation were $957.0 million, $1,381.5 million, and $424.5 million, respectively. We estimate that 82% of our unfunded pension obligation as of December 31, 2020, is related to our U.S. government contracting business, Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that offer acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain items affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, and recognizing revenues.\nThe following table presents the assumptions to determine the retirement benefits expense (income):\nThe following table summarizes our environmental reserve activity: \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe threats we face range from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, insider threats and other threat vectors targeting us and other defense and aerospace companies; because we protect national security information. In addition, cyber threats are evolving, growing in their frequency and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, destructive malware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, disruption or denial of service attacks, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential, personal or otherwise protected information (ours or that of our employees, customers or partners), and corruption of data, networks or systems. We also could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners' or customers' systems that are used in connection with our business.\nThe decrease in segment margin was primarily driven by the following: (i) cost growth on a portion of the Standard Missile program in 2020; (ii) cost growth and performance issues in 2020 on the Commercial Crew Development program; (iii) the reserve release upon the final AJ-60 solid rocket motor delivery in 2019; and (iv) higher retirement benefit expense. These factors were partially offset by (i) improved performance and risk retirements on the RS-68, MRBM, and THAAD programs and (ii) lower depreciation expense.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Although we believe that the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively and, if significant, disclosed in notes of the consolidated financial statements.\nWe closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. We review the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the DCAA. Accordingly, we record an allowance on our unbilled receivables for amounts of potential contract overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and collected.\nSuch repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are not permitted to pay cash dividends during the Pre-Closing Period (as defined therein), other than the pre-closing dividend approved by the Board of Directors on December 19, 2020.\nThe areas most affected by our accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition, other contract considerations, goodwill, retirement benefit plans, litigation, environmental remediation costs and recoveries, and income taxes. Except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our operating segments, these areas affect the financial results of our business segments.\n _________\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative impacts that it is having on the global economy and U.S. companies. The CARES Act includes various financial measures to assist companies, including temporary changes to income and non-income-based tax laws. Through these provisions, as of December 31, 2020, we have delayed $21.4 million of payroll tax payments. Additionally, in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act, we accelerated depreciation on qualified improvement property placed in service after December 31, 2017 for income tax purposes.\nThe following table summarizes the percentages of net sales for significant programs, all of which are included in the U.S. government sales and are comprised of multiple contracts:\nPrimary reason for change. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily driven by stock-based compensation that was partially offset by a decrease in business travel-related expenses due to our restrictions on travel in response to COVID-19. For detailed information about stock-based compensation refer to Note 9(e) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\n\u2022record related estimated recoveries when such recoveries are deemed probable.\n* We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under the heading \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n* Less than 10%\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have continued to cause significant economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets which could adversely impact the funded status of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. The funded status of our pension plan is impacted by the investment experience of the plan assets, by any changes in U.S. law, and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by the tax-qualified pension plan in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plan assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the Internal Revenue Service regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plan could be higher than we expect.\nEnvironmental Reserves\nWe accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred, and when our costs can be reasonably estimated. In most cases, only a range of reasonably probable costs can be estimated. In establishing the reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Environmental reserves include the costs of completing remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions, regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nThe effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. We continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from our insurance carriers and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.\n\nTotal backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated). Indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog. Backlog is subject to funding delays or program restructurings/cancellations which are beyond our control.\nThe following table summarizes the effects of a one-percentage-point change in key assumptions on the projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020, and on retirement benefits expense for 2020:\nMajor Customers\nDuring 2020, we had $45.1 million of net favorable changes in contract estimates on operating results before income taxes compared with net favorable changes of $38.4 million during 2019.\nReal Estate Segment\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for the Company and our 100% owned consolidated subsidiaries. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.\nNet Sales:\n_________\nCOVID-19\nFor a discussion of our accounting for environmental remediation obligations and costs and related legal matters, see \"Environmental Matters\" above and Notes 8(b) and 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe expenses associated with adjustments to the environmental reserves are recorded as a component of other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the impact of environmental reserves and recoveries to the consolidated statements of operations: \nOur business outlook is affected by both increasing complexity in the global security environment and continuing worldwide economic pressures, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on protecting our employees' health and safety, delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.\nWe evaluate the contract value and cost estimates for performance obligations at least quarterly and more frequently when circumstances significantly change. Factors considered in estimating the work to be completed include, but are not limited to: labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of the work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, warranty costs, volume assumptions, anticipated labor agreements, inflationary trends, schedule and performance delays, availability of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of costs incurred outside the original contract included in any estimates to complete. When our estimate of total costs to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation exceeds the expected revenue, we recognize the loss immediately. When we determine that a change in estimates has an impact on the associated profit of a performance obligation, we record the cumulative positive or negative adjustment to the statement of operations. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to the status of certain long-term contracts may have a material effect on our operating results. The following table summarizes the impact of the changes in significant contract accounting estimates on our Aerospace and Defense segment operating results:\nEnvironmental Reserves and Estimated Recoveries\nCapital Structure\n(5) The conditional asset retirement obligations presented are related to our Aerospace and Defense segment and are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government.\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of debt obligations, operating leases, certain other liabilities, and other commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020: \nResults of Operations:\n(4) Purchase obligations represent open purchase orders and other commitments to suppliers, subcontractors, and other outsourcing partners for equipment, materials, and supplies in the normal course of business. These amounts are based on volumes consistent with anticipated requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from customers. A substantial portion of these amounts are recoverable through our contracts with the U.S. government.\nThe $16.7 million of environmental reserve additions in 2019 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $10.0 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.1 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (iii) $1.9 million of sampling analysis costs; and (iv) $0.7 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nSee Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for information relating to our discussion of the effects of recent accounting pronouncements.\nWe recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our aerospace and defense performance obligations are satisfied over time either as the service is provided, or as control transfers to the customer. Transfer of control is evidenced by our contractual right to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit on contracts with highly customized products that we have no alternative use for. We measure progress on substantially all our performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method, which we believe best depicts the transfer of control of goods and services to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, we record revenues based upon costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated cost at completion. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead, and general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.\n(1) Holders may convert their 2\u00bc% Notes at their option from January 1, 2021, through March 31, 2021, because our closing stock price exceeded $33.80 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period prior to December 31, 2020. We have a stated intention to cash settle the principal amount of the 2\u00bc% Notes with the conversion premium to be settled in common shares. Accordingly, the 2\u00bc% Notes are classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2020. See Notes 6 and 15 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nOperating Segment Information:\nOur current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. See Notes 8(b) and 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report and \"Environmental Matters\" below for summary of our environmental reserve activity.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, we had capital expenditures of $54.6 million and $42.9 million, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2020 was primarily due to capacity expansion to support the RS-25 program.\nThe $32.4 million of environmental reserve additions in 2020 was primarily due to the following items: (i) $13.7 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (ii) $10.2 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (iii) $3.2 million of sampling analysis costs; and (iv) $5.3 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.\nWe believe that certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or a partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. Our tax reserves reflect the difference between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The accounting standards provide guidance for the recognition and measurement in financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. As the examination process progresses with tax authorities, adjustments to tax reserves may be necessary to reflect taxes payable upon settlement. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nContractual Obligations:", "item_7_tables": "Table 38: <table><tr><td>

primarily driven by growth in the RS-25, MRBM, and GMLRS programs. This was partially offset by declines in the Commercial Crew Development program and cancellation of the RKV program in 2019. \n- Net income was $137.7 million or 6.6% of net sales. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP measure) was $138.4 million or 6.7% of net sales.\n- Backlog grew to $6.7 billion, up 24% compared to 2019.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\n- Minimal adverse financial impact in 2020 but uncertainty remains regarding future impact. Continuing safety protocols and monitoring business operations.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Gross margin declined due to cost growth on certain programs. \n- Higher retirement benefit expense drove increased costs.\n- SG&A increased due to higher stock compensation expense.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n- Significant estimates involved in revenue recognition, retirement benefit plans, environmental remediation costs, litigation reserves and income taxes.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Strong cash flow from operations of $363.8 million. \n- Capital expenditures of $54.6 million.\n- Cash used for share repurchases and dividends.\n- Funded debt level is $624.3 million.\n\nLooking Ahead  \n- Key risk factors include uncertainty related to COVID-19, dependence on government contracts, reductions in government spending, environmental costs and underfunded pension obligations."}
