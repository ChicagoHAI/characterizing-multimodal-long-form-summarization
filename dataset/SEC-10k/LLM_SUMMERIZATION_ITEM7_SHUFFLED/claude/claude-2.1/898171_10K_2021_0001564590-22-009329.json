The comments are intended to supplement and should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing on pages through of this Annual Report. References to changes in assets and liabilities represent end-of-period balances unless otherwise noted. Statements contained in this Annual Report, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Amounts herein could vary because of market and other factors. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, factors discussed in documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission periodically.

Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates with respect to the financial condition, expected or anticipated revenue, results of operations and business of the Company that are subject to various factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. These factors include, but are not limited to: the impact of the novel Coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, on our borrowers' ability to meet their financial obligations to us; increases in our past due loans and provisions for loan losses that may result from COVID-19; declines in general economic conditions, including increased stress in the financial markets due to COVID-19; changes in interest rates, deposit flows, loan demand, real estate values, and competition; changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines; changes in legislation or regulation; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting the Company's operations, pricing, products and services. Any use of we\u201d or our\u201d in the following discussion refers to the Company on a consolidated basis.\nFinancial Condition at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nThe Company's total assets increased $111.9 million from $827.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $939.7 million at December 31, 2021. The primary driver of this growth was an increase in customer deposits held by the Bank which was due, in large part, to our customers' receipt of government economic stimulus payments. This deposit growth was utilized to fund a substantial increase in the investment securities portfolio during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nInvestment securities consist of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. Total investment securities increased $141.4 million, or 64.4%, from $219.7 million at December 31, 2020 to $361.1 million at December 31, 2021, due to investments of cash into longer-term, higher yielding assets. At December 31, 2021, the Company had net unrealized losses on securities available for sale of $1.5 million, compared to net unrealized gains of $5.4 million at December 31, 2020. The significant decline in fair value is directly related to the increase in market interest rates at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, as the market signals recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the Company sold a portion of an equity security investment bringing its principal value down to $270,000 at December 31, 2021 from $901,000 at December 30, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the unrealized gain on the investment totaled $122,000, resulting in a fair value of $392,000 for the security.\nLoans held for investment decreased $47.0 million from $467.7 million at December 31, 2020 to $420.8 million at December 31, 2021. The main reason for the decline was a $60.6 million reduction in SBA PPP loans due to receipt of loan forgiveness. Not including SBA PPP loans, the Company experienced net growth overall with the largest increase occurring in the commercial segment. During 2021 the Company funded 879 SBA PPP Round 2 loans for a total of $46.4 million. These loans are unsecured commercial loans, but are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. These new SBA PPP loans, however, were offset by forgiveness and payoffs of $80.4 million on SBA PPP loans originally funded during 2020 and forgiveness and payoffs of $31.1 million of SBA PPP Round 2 loans. Loans held for sale increased 211.6%, or $14.7 million, as many of the closed loans are being held longer in an effort to earn additional interest income before selling the loans on the secondary market.\nThe allowance for loan loss was $4.0 million at December 31, 2021, which represents 0.96% of the total loans held for investment, a decrease of 8.6% from December 31, 2020. Additional discussion regarding the decrease in the allowance is included in the Asset Quality section below.\nOther changes in consolidated assets are primarily related to loan servicing assets, mortgage banking derivatives and other assets. Loan servicing assets increased $1.1 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 due to retention of servicing rights related to sustained sales of residential mortgage loans. The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives decreased $804,000 during 2021, and other assets decreased $1.3 million primarily due to the $1.1 million sale of an investment in a community development project.\nCustomer deposits, our primary funding source, experienced a $93.6 million increase during the year, increasing from $743.2 million to $836.8 million at December 31, 2021, a 12.6% increase. In addition to receipt of government stimulus deposits, a large portion of\nthis increase is related to the funding of SBA PPP Round 2 loans, some of the proceeds of which were deposited by our customers into their deposit accounts held at the Company's subsidiary bank. Demand noninterest-bearing checking accounts increased $33.6 million, interest checking and money market accounts increased by $41.4 million and savings deposits increased $28.5 million during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. Time deposits decreased $10.1 million during the same period as customers transitioned to liquid accounts.\nDuring 2021, the Company's net borrowings increased by $18.9 million. Borrowings consist of both short-term and long-term borrowed funds. The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no outstanding advances. Short-term borrowings consisted of $1.1 million in master notes, and long-term borrowings consisted solely of junior subordinated debt securities totaling $29.5 million at December 31, 2021. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company issued $10.0 million in subordinated debt securities with a final maturity date of September 30, 2029 that may be redeemed on or after September 30, 2024. This junior subordinated debt pays interest quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 5.25%. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company issued $12.0 million and $8.0 million of 10-year and 15-year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debt securities, respectively. The 10-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2031, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2026, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 3.5%. From and including September 3, 2026 to but excluding September 3, 2031, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 10-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus 283 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The 15-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2036, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2031, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 4.0%. From and including September 3, 2031 to but excluding September 3, 2036, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 15-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month SOFR plus 292 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The subordinated debt has been structured to qualify as and is included in the calculation of the Company's Tier 2 capital. The Company also has a $3.0 million line of credit of which $3.0 million was available to use at December 31, 2021.\nOther consolidated liabilities decreased $2.1 million from $13.6 million at December 31, 2020 to $11.5 million at December 31, 2021. The valuation of mortgage banking derivatives decreased by $338,000. Other liabilities decreased by $1.8 million as a result of a reduction in the reserve for federal income tax and a decrease in supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities.\nAt December 31, 2021, total shareholders' equity was $60.8 million, an increase of $1.6 million from December 31, 2020. Net income for the period was $10.1 million. Unrealized gains on investment securities, net of tax, declined by $5.3 million to a loss position as the yield curve continues to steepen. The Company repurchased 298,700 outstanding shares of common stock at an aggregate repurchase price of $2.6 million. The Company also paid $565,000 in dividends attributed to noncontrolling interest. See Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the noncontrolling interest. At December 31, 2021, the Company and its subsidiary bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nEarnings\nUwharrie Capital Corp reported net income of $10.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $8.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.0 million. Net income available to common shareholders was $9.5 million, or $1.33 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $7.5 million, or $1.03 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net income available to common shareholders is net income less any dividends paid on the aforementioned noncontrolling interest.\nNet Interest Income\nAs with most financial institutions, the primary component of earnings for our subsidiary bank is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, principally from the loan and investment securities portfolios, and interest expense, principally on customer deposits and wholesale borrowings. Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume, spread and margin. For this purpose, volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as levels of noninterest bearing liabilities and capital.\nNet interest income increased $4.3 million to a total of $26.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from the $21.8 million earned in the same period of 2020. The average yield on our interest-earning assets decreased 8 basis points to 3.42%, while the average rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities decreased 18 basis points. These decreases resulted in a net increase of 11 basis\npoints in our interest rate spread, from 3.04% in 2020 to 3.15% in 2021. Our net interest margin for 2021 was 3.23%, compared to 3.18% in 2020. As a part of the loan agreements, a portion of the Company's loan portfolio has interest rate floors and caps. The interest rate floor feature allows the Company to maintain a more favorable interest margin despite a decline in rates; however, the interest rate cap could hurt the margin in a rising rate environment. Financial Table 1 presents a detailed analysis of the components of the Company's net interest income, while Financial Table 2 summarizes the effects on net interest income from changes in interest rates and in the dollar volume of the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Financial Table 1 and Table 2, as well other Financial Tables referenced in this discussion and analysis, appear at the end of this annual report, immediately preceding the identification of the Company's board of directors and executive officers.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe recovery of loan losses was $917,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to a provision of $2.4 million for the same period in 2020. There were net loan recoveries of $541,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net loan recoveries of $34,000 during the same period of 2020. Refer to the Asset Quality section below for further information.\nNoninterest Income\nThe Company generates most of its revenue from net interest income; however, diversification of our earnings base is a key strategic initiative to our long-term success. Noninterest income decreased 9.3%, from $20.9 million in 2020, to $18.9 million in 2021, a decrease of $1.9 million. The primary factor contributing to the decrease was a decline in income from mortgage loan sales as production began to level out after the surge in refinancing caused by the lower interest rate environment during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The gain on sale of securities increased by $920,000 to $991,000 at December 31, 2021, compared to $77,000 at December 31, 2020. This gain served to offset the decline in income from mortgage banking as the Company worked to reduce the duration of the investment portfolio in an attempt to protect capital as long-term interest rates rise.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $33.1 million compared to $29.9 million for 2020, an increase of $3.2 million. Salaries and employee benefits, the largest component of noninterest expense, increased $1.8 million, from $19.9 million for the period ending December 31, 2020 to $21.6 million for 2021 to account for wage and benefit cost increases. Marketing and donations increased $334,000 as the Company makes a continued effort to support the communities we serve by giving back and supporting economic development and growth. Supplemental executive retirement plan expense increased $610,000 during 2021 to $942,000 due to market valuation adjustments. Financial Table 5 reflects the additional breakdown of other noninterest expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company had income tax expense of $2.8 million for 2021 at an effective tax rate of 21.51% compared to income tax expense of $2.3 million in 2020 with an effective tax rate of 22.38%. Income taxes computed at the statutory rate are affected primarily by the eligible amount of interest earned on state and municipal securities, tax-free municipal loans and income earned on bank-owned life insurance. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the effective tax rate decreased due to an additional tax accrual in the 2020 period related to a supplemental executive retirement plan distribution.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nResults of operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 can be found in the 2020 10-K Annual Report filing.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to operations and recoveries of amounts previously charged off and is reduced by recovery of provisions and charge offs of loans. Management continuously evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance, management considers the following: the growth, composition and industry diversification of the portfolio; historical loan loss experience; current delinquency levels; adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay; estimated value of any underlying collateral; prevailing economic conditions; and other relevant factors. The Company's credit administration function, through a review process, periodically validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment. In addition, as a given loan's credit quality improves or deteriorates, the credit administration department has the responsibility to change the borrower's risk grade accordingly. For loans determined to be impaired, the allowance is based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the selling costs. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans, which may be susceptible to significant change. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require additions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management.\nManagement uses a risk-grading program designed to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio. In this program, risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers then reviewed and monitored by credit administration. This process includes the maintenance of an internally classified loan list that is designed to help management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets, management considers, among other factors, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, the borrower's ability to repay, the borrower's payment history, and the current delinquent status. Because of this process, certain loans are deemed to be impaired and evaluated as an impaired loan.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, management made adjustments to the allowance for loan losses methodology. The qualitative factors were expanded to include additional reserves for niche lending portfolios of hotel, retained interest in the unguaranteed portion of U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans (not including PPP loans), and SBA PPP loans. The risk in these portfolios is measurable, in addition to the standard probable loss calculation performed on all non-impaired loans. With the impact of COVID-19 on all industries, the hotel and SBA (non-PPP) loan categories on the Company's balance sheet have been identified as having elevated credit risk. The SBA (non-PPP) reflects the unguaranteed portion of SBA guaranteed loans originated by the Company. SBA PPP loans, while 100% guaranteed by SBA, could result in some loss if fraud occurs or there are reporting issues or duplicate funding of loans. In addition, management eliminated its qualitative factor based on a 21-day weighted average of the VIX index, a real-time index that measures the expectation of the market's 30-day forward-looking volatility, and replaced it with a multi-factor linear regression encompassing the following economic data: Case Shiller for North Carolina (NC) home price index, NC unemployment rate, 2-year/10-year US Treasury spread, customer sentiment, and a VIX quarterly average factor. During the third quarter of 2020, due to the lagging nature of the data (primarily unemployment data from U.S. government data) used in the multi-factor linear regression, management adopted an additional qualitative factor to incorporate more current unemployment data that was developed from non-governmental sources. The factor further represents the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and extended economic impacts. There were no significant adjustments to the allowance for loan losses methodology during 2021.\nThe portion of the Company's allowance for loan loss model related to general reserves captures the mean loss of individual loans within the loan portfolio and adds additional loss based on economic uncertainty and specific indicators of potential issues in the market. Specifically, the Company calculates probable losses on loans by computing a probability of loss and multiplying that by a loss given default derived from historical experience. An additional calculation based on economic uncertainty is added to the probable losses, thus deriving the estimated loss scenario by FDIC call report codes. Together, these expected components, as well as a reserve for qualitative factors based on management's discretion of economic conditions, form the basis of the allowance model. The loans that are impaired and included in the specific reserve are excluded from these calculations.\nThe Company assesses the probability of losses inherent in the loan portfolio using probability of default data derived from the Company's internal historical data, representing a one-year loss horizon for each obligor. Credit scores are used within the model to determine the probability of default. The Company updates the credit scores for individuals that either have a loan, or are financially responsible for the loan, semi-annually, during the first and third quarters. During 2021, the average effective credit score of the portfolio, excluding loans in default, decreased slightly from 768 to 767. The probability of default associated with each credit score is a major driver in the allowance for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of an appropriate amount to provide for probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business. While management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while management\nbelieves it has established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, there can be no assurance that banking regulators, in reviewing the Company's portfolio, will not require an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary, should the quality of any loans deteriorate because of the factors discussed herein. Unexpected global events, such as the unprecedented economic disruption due to COVID-19, are the type of future events that often cause material adjustments to the allowance to be necessary. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and the value of its securities.\nAt December 31, 2021, the levels of our impaired loans, which includes all loans in non-accrual status, TDRs, and other loans deemed by management to be impaired, were $4.7 million, compared to $8.2 million at December 31, 2020, a net decrease of $3.4 million. The decrease is related to four large impaired loans paying off in during 2021. Three of these large impaired relationships were loans in non-accrual status. As a result, non-accrual loans decreased from $3.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $972,000 at December 31, 2021.\nThe allowance, expressed as a percentage of gross loans held for investment, increased two basis points from 0.94% at December 31, 2020 to 0.96% at December 31, 2021. The collectively evaluated reserve allowance as a percentage of collectively evaluated loans was 0.93% at December 31, 2020 and 0.92% at December 31, 2020. The individually evaluated allowance as a percentage of individually evaluated loans increased from 1.81% to 4.54% for the same periods, a direct result of the $3.4 million net decrease in impaired loans during the year.\nThe ratio of nonperforming loans, which consists of non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing, to total loans decreased significantly from 0.80% at December 31, 2020, to 0.23% at December 31, 2021. This improvement is attributable to the previously mentioned payoffs of three large non-accrual loans.\nAs of December 31, 2021, management believed the level of the allowance for loan losses was appropriate in light of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\nOther real estate owned remained at $0 through December 31, 2021, as there were no loans foreclosed on during the year.\nTroubled debt restructured loans, a component of impaired loans, totaled $3.8 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $4.4 million at December 31, 2020. One relationship of $214,000 was added during the year, but this increase was offset by pay-offs and pay-downs totaling $876,000. At December 31, 2021, there was one troubled debt restructured loan in non-accrual status, which had a balance of $39,000.\nAs discussed in Note 5 (Troubled Debt Restructures) of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the CARES Act allowed for loan modifications related to COVID-19 impacts to be excluded from TDR status. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no remaining COVID-19 modifications on outstanding loans.\nThe following table shows the comparison of nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> Nonperforming Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming Assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accruing loans past due 90 days or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonaccrual loans to total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.80\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.96\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.94\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 414.20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117.14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nThe Company continues to maintain capital ratios that support its asset growth. In 2013, bank regulatory agencies approved regulatory capital guidelines ( Basel III\u201d) aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.50%, a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.00%, require a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.00%, and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. A capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, was also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer began phasing in on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.50% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the rules. The rules also revise the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, total capital, and risk-weighted assets.\nThe phase-in period for the rules became effective for the Company and its subsidiary bank on January 1, 2015, with full compliance of all the rules' requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, becoming fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. Pursuant to the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, the Company is exempt from Basel III. As of December 31, 2021, the Company and its subsidiary bank continue to exceed minimum capital standards and remain well-capitalized under applicable capital adequacy rules.\nIn January 2013, the Company's subsidiary bank issued $7.9 million of Fixed Rate Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B. The preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital at the bank and pays dividends at a rate of 5.30%. The offering raised $7.9 million less issuance costs of $113,000.\nDuring the third quarter of 2013, the Company's subsidiary bank raised an additional $2.8 million of Fixed Rate Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C. The preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital at the bank and pays dividends at an annual rate of 5.30%. The preferred stock has no voting rights. The offering raised $2.8 million less issuance costs of $23,000.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company conducted a private placement offering of fixed rate junior subordinated debt securities at $1,000 per security with a required minimum investment of $50,000. The offering raised $10.0 million, of which the entire $10.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2021. These securities have a final maturity date of September 30, 2029 and may be redeemed by the Company after September 30, 2024. The junior subordinated debt pays interest quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 5.25%. All proceeds of this private placement qualify and are included in the calculation of Tier 2 capital. Once the final maturity drops under five years, the Company must impose a twenty percent annual reduction per year of the amount of the proceeds from the sale of these securities that are eligible to be counted as Tier 2 capital. The Company will have a twenty percent reduction beginning at September 30, 2024.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company issued $12.0 million and $8.0 million of 10-year and 15-year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debt securities, respectively. The 10-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2031, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2026, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 3.5%. From and including September 3, 2026 to but excluding September 3, 2031, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 10-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month SOFR plus 283 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The 15-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2036, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2031, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 4.0%. From and including September 3, 2031 to but excluding September 3, 2036, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 15-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month SOFR plus 292 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The subordinated debt has been structured to qualify as and is included in the calculation of the Company's Tier 2 capital. Once the final maturity drops under five years, the Company must impose a twenty percent annual reduction per year of the amount of the proceeds from the sale of these securities that are eligible to be counted as Tier 2 capital. The Company will have a twenty percent reduction beginning at September 3, 2026 and September 3, 2031 for the 10-year and 15-year subordinated notes, respectively.\nAll of the Company's aforementioned investment in its subsidiary bank qualifies for Tier 1 capital treatment for the Bank and is included as such in its year end capital ratios.\nThe Company expects to continue to exceed required minimum capital ratios without altering current operations or strategy. Note 15 (Shareholders' Equity and Regulatory Matters) to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presents additional information regarding the Company's and its subsidiary bank's capital ratios.\nDividends\nThe Board of Directors of Uwharrie Capital Corp declared a 3% stock dividend in 2021 and 2% stock dividend in both 2020 and 2019. All references in this Annual Report to net income per share and weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding reflect the effects of these stock dividends.\nLiquidity\nThe objective of the Company's liquidity management policy is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on any opportunities for expansion. Liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise. Liquidity is managed primarily by the selection of asset mix and the maturity mix of liabilities. Maturities and the marketability of securities and other funding sources provide a source of liquidity to meet deposit fluctuations. Maturities in the securities portfolio, presented in Financial Table 3, are supported by cash flows from mortgage-backed securities that have longer-term contractual maturities. The Company's other sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans and cash flows generated from operation. Growth in deposits is typically the primary source of funds for loan growth, supported by long-term credit available from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The Company and its subsidiary bank have multiple funding sources, in addition to deposits, that can be used to increase liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility. Other funding sources at year-end 2021 included $43.0 million in federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks and approximately $93.8 million of credit availability from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The Company may also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window with credit availability of $17.6 million.\nAt December 31, 2021, short-term borrowings amounted to $1.1 million. Long-term debt at that date consisted solely of $29.5 million of junior subordinated debt. Other contractual obligations of the Company exist in the form of operating leases and deposits. Obligations for operating leases and deposits totaled $2.4 million and $836.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. Note 8 (Leases) and Note 9 (Deposits) to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information, including maturities, regarding these obligations.\nThe Company has various financial instruments (outstanding commitments) with off-balance sheet risk that are issued in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. See Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these commitments and contingent liabilities.\nManagement believes that the Company's current sources of funds provide adequate liquidity for its current cash flow needs.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. What makes these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex is the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about these and other accounting policies utilized by the Company.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of the losses that have been incurred in the loan portfolio but have not yet been charged-off. The allowance is a critical accounting estimate in the financial statements as it provides, by reference, an indication of the quality of the loan portfolio. Estimating credit losses is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Additional measurement uncertainty in the estimate is due, in part, to the large amount of data evaluated, the long-term nature of the underlying assets and the analysis of economic indicators. Regulatory examiners may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgement about information available to them at the time of their assessment.\nOn a regular basis, the allowance for loan losses is evaluated both individually and collectively by loan class. Homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated by loan class for impairment. However, once a loan is deemed impaired, it is evaluated individually for specific impairment. Appropriately dividing the loan portfolio into different segments with similar risk characteristics aids in providing a more accurate estimation of the portfolio's loss. The Company's methodology for estimating loan losses is well documented and supported by internal controls, and validation of the process is performed on a recurring basis.\nLoan Servicing Assets\nThe Company capitalizes mortgage and U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan servicing rights when loans are sold and the loan servicing is retained. Servicing revenue is recognized in the statement of income as a component of other noninterest income. The amortization of servicing rights is realized over the estimated period that net servicing revenues are expected to be received. Essential assumptions used to value the loan servicing rights include prepayment speeds, discount rates and costs to service the loan. Servicing assets are periodically evaluated for impairment based upon their fair value, and any resulting impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance and charged to other expense. An unrelated third party performs a quarterly valuation of the Company's Fannie Mae Mortgage Servicing Rights. Significant judgement is required to estimate the value of servicing rights due to the nature and variety of assumptions used. As such, changes in assumptions could materially affect the estimated value of loan servicing assets.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nNet Interest Income (Margin) is the single largest component of revenue for the Company. Net Interest Margin is the difference between the yield on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The margin can vary over time as interest rates change. The variance fluctuates based on both the timing (repricing) and magnitude of maturing assets and liabilities.\nTo identify interest rate sensitivity, a common measure is a gap analysis, which reflects the difference or gap\u201d between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various periods. While management reviews this information, it has implemented the use of an income simulation model, which calculates expected future Net Interest Income (Margin) based on projected interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and forecasted interest rates along with multiple other forecasted assumptions. Management believes this provides a more relevant view of interest rate risk sensitivity than the traditional gap analysis because the gap analysis ignores optionality embedded in the balance sheet, such as prepayments or changes based on interest rates. The income simulation model allows a comparison of flat, rising and falling rate scenarios to determine the interest rate sensitivity of earnings in varying interest rate environments.\nThe Company models immediate rising and declining rate shocks of up to 4% (in 1% intervals) on its subsidiary bank, using a static balance sheet for a two-year horizon, as preferred by regulators. The most recent consolidated 2% rate shock projections for a one-year horizon, indicates a negative impact of (9.81%) on Net Interest Income (Margin) in a rates-down scenario and a positive impact of 10.69% on Net Interest Income (Margin) in a rates-up scenario. Based on the most recent twelve-month forecast, the subsidiary bank is asset-sensitive and may experience some negative impact to earnings should interest rates decline. While many interest-bearing assets would reprice in a declining interest rate environment; many liabilities are already approaching 0% interest rates. The subsidiary bank has the potential to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, but current market deposit pricing and embedded options in the balance sheet may limit the upside potential.\nThe principal goals for asset liability management for the Company are to maintain adequate levels and sources of liquidity and to manage interest rate risk. Interest rate risk management attempts to balance the effects of interest rate changes on both interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities to protect Net Interest Income (Margin) from wide fluctuations as a result of changes in market interest rates. To that end, management has recommended and the board has approved policy limits that minimize the downside risk from interest rate shifts. The aforementioned ratios are within those stated limits of -18% for the respective modeled scenarios at the subsidiary bank and combined. Managing interest rate risk is an important factor to the long-term viability of the Company since Net Interest Income (Margin) is such a large component of earnings. The Company's Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) monitors market changes in interest rates and assists with the pricing of loans and deposit products while considering the funding source needs, asset growth projections, and necessary operating liquidity.\nFinancial Table 1\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income Analysis\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

adds additional loss based on economic uncertainty and specific indicators of potential issues in the market. Specifically, the Company calculates probable losses on loans by computing a probability of loss and multiplying that by a loss given default derived from historical experience. An additional calculation based on economic uncertainty is added to the probable losses, thus deriving the estimated loss scenario by FDIC call report codes. Together, these expected components, as well as a reserve for qualitative factors based on management's discretion of economic conditions, form the basis of the allowance model.

Long-term debt at that date consisted solely of $29.5 million of junior subordinated debt. Other contractual obligations of the Company exist in the form of operating leases and deposits. Obligations for operating leases and deposits totaled $2.4 million and $836.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. Note 8 (Leases) and Note 9 (Deposits) to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information, including maturities, regarding these obligations.\nDuring 2021, the Company's net borrowings increased by $18.9 million. Borrowings consist of both short-term and long-term borrowed funds. The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no outstanding advances. Short-term borrowings consisted of $1.1 million in master notes, and long-term borrowings consisted solely of junior subordinated debt securities totaling $29.5 million at December 31, 2021. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company issued $10.0 million in subordinated debt securities with a final maturity date of September 30, 2029 that may be redeemed on or after September 30, 2024. This junior subordinated debt pays interest quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 5.25%. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company issued $12.0 million and $8.0 million of 10-year and 15-year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debt securities, respectively. The 10-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2031, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2026, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 3.5%. From and including September 3, 2026 to but excluding September 3, 2031, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 10-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus 283 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The 15-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2036, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2031, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 4.0%. From and including September 3, 2031 to but excluding September 3, 2036, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 15-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month SOFR plus 292 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The subordinated debt has been structured to qualify as and is included in the calculation of the Company's Tier 2 capital. The Company also has a $3.0 million line of credit of which $3.0 million was available to use at December 31, 2021.\nFinancial Table 3\npoints in our interest rate spread, from 3.04% in 2020 to 3.15% in 2021. Our net interest margin for 2021 was 3.23%, compared to 3.18% in 2020. As a part of the loan agreements, a portion of the Company's loan portfolio has interest rate floors and caps. The interest rate floor feature allows the Company to maintain a more favorable interest margin despite a decline in rates; however, the interest rate cap could hurt the margin in a rising rate environment.

Servicing revenue is recognized in the statement of income as a component of other noninterest income. The amortization of servicing rights is realized over the estimated period that net servicing revenues are expected to be received. Essential assumptions used to value the loan servicing rights include prepayment speeds, discount rates and costs to service the loan. Servicing assets are periodically evaluated for impairment based upon their fair value, and any resulting impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance and charged to other expense. An unrelated third party performs a quarterly valuation of the Company's Fannie Mae Mortgage Servicing Rights. Significant judgement is required to estimate the value of servicing rights due to the nature and variety of assumptions used. As such, changes in assumptions could materially affect the estimated value of loan servicing assets.\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other banking fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokerage commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interchange and card transaction fees, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment securities gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other gains (losses) from sale of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from mortgage banking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplemental executive retirement plan gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allowance for loan loss was $4.0 million at December 31, 2021, which represents 0.96% of the total loans held for investment, a decrease of 8.6% from December 31, 2020.

Unexpected global events, such as the unprecedented economic disruption due to COVID-19, are the type of future events that often cause material adjustments to the allowance to be necessary.

in each category as a percent of total loans outstanding. \nThe Company's total assets increased $111.9 million from $827.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $939.7 million at December 31, 2021. The primary driver of this growth was an increase in customer deposits held by the Bank which was due, in large part, to our customers' receipt of government economic stimulus payments. This deposit growth was utilized to fund a substantial increase in the investment securities portfolio during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nSelected Loan Maturities\nThe recovery of loan losses was $917,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to a provision of $2.4 million for the same period in 2020. There were net loan recoveries of $541,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net loan recoveries of $34,000 during the same period of 2020. Refer to the Asset Quality section below for further information.\nThe phase-in period for the rules became effective for the Company and its subsidiary bank on January 1, 2015, with full compliance of all the rules' requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, becoming fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. Pursuant to the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, the Company is exempt from Basel III. As of December 31, 2021, the Company and its subsidiary bank continue to exceed minimum capital standards and remain well-capitalized under applicable capital adequacy rules.\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income Analysis\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company conducted a private placement offering of fixed rate junior subordinated debt securities at $1,000 per security with a required minimum investment of $50,000. The offering raised $10.0 million, of which the entire $10.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2021. These securities have a final maturity date of September 30, 2029 and may be redeemed by the Company after September 30, 2024. The junior subordinated debt pays interest quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 5.25%. All proceeds of this private placement qualify and are included in the calculation of Tier 2 capital. Once the final maturity drops under five years, the Company must impose a twenty percent annual reduction per year of the amount of the proceeds from the sale of these securities that are eligible to be counted as Tier 2 capital. The Company will have a twenty percent reduction beginning at September 30, 2024.\nThe Company models immediate rising and declining rate shocks of up to 4% (in 1% intervals) on its subsidiary bank, using a static balance sheet for a two-year horizon, as preferred by regulators. The most recent consolidated 2% rate shock projections for a one-year horizon, indicates a negative impact of (9.81%) on Net Interest Income (Margin) in a rates-down scenario and a positive impact of 10.69% on Net Interest Income (Margin) in a rates-up scenario. Based on the most recent twelve-month forecast, the subsidiary bank is asset-sensitive and may experience some negative impact to earnings should interest rates decline. While many interest-bearing assets would reprice in a declining interest rate environment; many liabilities are already approaching 0% interest rates. The subsidiary bank has the potential to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, but current market deposit pricing and embedded options in the balance sheet may limit the upside potential.\nOther changes in consolidated assets are primarily related to loan servicing assets, mortgage banking derivatives and other assets. Loan servicing assets increased $1.1 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 due to retention of servicing rights related to sustained sales of residential mortgage loans. The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives decreased $804,000 during 2021, and other assets decreased $1.3 million primarily due to the $1.1 million sale of an investment in a community development project.\nLoans held for investment decreased $47.0 million from $467.7 million at December 31, 2020 to $420.8 million at December 31, 2021. The main reason for the decline was a $60.6 million reduction in SBA PPP loans due to receipt of loan forgiveness. Not including SBA PPP loans, the Company experienced net growth overall with the largest increase occurring in the commercial segment. During 2021 the Company funded 879 SBA PPP Round 2 loans for a total of $46.4 million. These loans are unsecured commercial loans, but are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. These new SBA PPP loans, however, were offset by forgiveness and payoffs of $80.4 million on SBA PPP loans originally funded during 2020 and forgiveness and payoffs of $31.1 million of SBA PPP Round 2 loans. Loans held for sale increased 211.6%, or $14.7 million, as many of the closed loans are being held longer in an effort to earn additional interest income before selling the loans on the secondary market.\nThe objective of the Company's liquidity management policy is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on any opportunities for expansion. Liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise. Liquidity is managed primarily by the selection of asset mix and the maturity mix of liabilities. Maturities and the marketability of securities and other funding sources provide a source of liquidity to meet deposit fluctuations. Maturities in the securities portfolio, presented in Financial Table 3, are supported by cash flows from mortgage-backed securities that have longer-term contractual maturities. The Company's other sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans and cash flows generated from operation. Growth in deposits is typically the primary source of funds for loan growth, supported by long-term credit available from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The Company and its subsidiary bank have multiple funding sources, in addition to deposits, that can be used to increase liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility. Other funding sources at year-end 2021 included $43.0 million in federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks and approximately $93.8 million of credit availability from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The Company may also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window with credit availability of $17.6 million.\nThe Company expects to continue to exceed required minimum capital ratios without altering current operations or strategy. Note 15 (Shareholders' Equity and Regulatory Matters) to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presents additional information regarding the Company's and its subsidiary bank's capital ratios.\nUwharrie Capital Corp reported net income of $10.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $8.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.0 million. Net income available to common shareholders was $9.5 million, or $1.33 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $7.5 million, or $1.03 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net income available to common shareholders is net income less any dividends paid on the aforementioned noncontrolling interest.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nthis increase is related to the funding of SBA PPP Round 2 loans, some of the proceeds of which were deposited by our customers into their deposit accounts held at the Company's subsidiary bank. Demand noninterest-bearing checking accounts increased $33.6 million, interest checking and money market accounts increased by $41.4 million and savings deposits increased $28.5 million during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. Time deposits decreased $10.1 million during the same period as customers transitioned to liquid accounts.\nManagement believes that the Company's current sources of funds provide adequate liquidity for its current cash flow needs.\nThe Company assesses the probability of losses inherent in the loan portfolio using probability of default data derived from the Company's internal historical data, representing a one-year loss horizon for each obligor. Credit scores are used within the model to determine the probability of default. The Company updates the credit scores for individuals that either have a loan, or are financially responsible for the loan, semi-annually, during the first and third quarters. During 2021, the average effective credit score of the portfolio, excluding loans in default, decreased slightly from 768 to 767. The probability of default associated with each credit score is a major driver in the allowance for loan losses.\nDuring the third quarter of 2013, the Company's subsidiary bank raised an additional $2.8 million of Fixed Rate Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C. The preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital at the bank and pays dividends at an annual rate of 5.30%. The preferred stock has no voting rights. The offering raised $2.8 million less issuance costs of $23,000.\n (1) Yields on securities and investments exempt from federal and/or state income taxes are stated on a fully tax-equivalent basis, assuming a 21.00% tax rate for 2021 and 2020. \nAt December 31, 2021, the levels of our impaired loans, which includes all loans in non-accrual status, TDRs, and other loans deemed by management to be impaired, were $4.7 million, compared to $8.2 million at December 31, 2020, a net decrease of $3.4 million. The decrease is related to four large impaired loans paying off in during 2021. Three of these large impaired relationships were loans in non-accrual status. As a result, non-accrual loans decreased from $3.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $972,000 at December 31, 2021.\nThe following table shows the comparison of nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe Company generates most of its revenue from net interest income; however, diversification of our earnings base is a key strategic initiative to our long-term success. Noninterest income decreased 9.3%, from $20.9 million in 2020, to $18.9 million in 2021, a decrease of $1.9 million. The primary factor contributing to the decrease was a decline in income from mortgage loan sales as production began to level out after the surge in refinancing caused by the lower interest rate environment during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The gain on sale of securities increased by $920,000 to $991,000 at December 31, 2021, compared to $77,000 at December 31, 2020. This gain served to offset the decline in income from mortgage banking as the Company worked to reduce the duration of the investment portfolio in an attempt to protect capital as long-term interest rates rise.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Board of Directors of Uwharrie Capital Corp declared a 3% stock dividend in 2021 and 2% stock dividend in both 2020 and 2019. All references in this Annual Report to net income per share and weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding reflect the effects of these stock dividends.\nNet Interest Income\nNoninterest Income\nFinancial Condition at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\n (2) Non-accrual loans are included in loans, net of unearned income. \n\nIn January 2013, the Company's subsidiary bank issued $7.9 million of Fixed Rate Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B. The preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital at the bank and pays dividends at a rate of 5.30%. The offering raised $7.9 million less issuance costs of $113,000.\nFinancial Table 4\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\nVolume and Rate Variance Analysis\nResults of operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 can be found in the 2020 10-K Annual Report filing.\n\nIncome Tax Expense\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nCapital Resources\n\n</td> </tr>\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to operations and recoveries of amounts previously charged off and is reduced by recovery of provisions and charge offs of loans. Management continuously evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance, management considers the following: the growth, composition and industry diversification of the portfolio; historical loan loss experience; current delinquency levels; adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay; estimated value of any underlying collateral; prevailing economic conditions; and other relevant factors. The Company's credit administration function, through a review process, periodically validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment. In addition, as a given loan's credit quality improves or deteriorates, the credit administration department has the responsibility to change the borrower's risk grade accordingly. For loans determined to be impaired, the allowance is based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the selling costs. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans, which may be susceptible to significant change. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require additions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management.\nWeighted Average Yield on Investments Securities (Continued)\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company issued $12.0 million and $8.0 million of 10-year and 15-year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debt securities, respectively. The 10-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2031, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2026, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 3.5%. From and including September 3, 2026 to but excluding September 3, 2031, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 10-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month SOFR plus 283 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The 15-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2036, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2031, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 4.0%. From and including September 3, 2031 to but excluding September 3, 2036, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 15-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month SOFR plus 292 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The subordinated debt has been structured to qualify as and is included in the calculation of the Company's Tier 2 capital. Once the final maturity drops under five years, the Company must impose a twenty percent annual reduction per year of the amount of the proceeds from the sale of these securities that are eligible to be counted as Tier 2 capital. The Company will have a twenty percent reduction beginning at September 3, 2026 and September 3, 2031 for the 10-year and 15-year subordinated notes, respectively.\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. What makes these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex is the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about these and other accounting policies utilized by the Company.\nFinancial Table 7\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of an appropriate amount to provide for probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business. While management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while management\nThe ratio of nonperforming loans, which consists of non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing, to total loans decreased significantly from 0.80% at December 31, 2020, to 0.23% at December 31, 2021. This improvement is attributable to the previously mentioned payoffs of three large non-accrual loans.\nNoninterest Expense\nMaturities of Time Deposits\nAt December 31, 2021, total shareholders' equity was $60.8 million, an increase of $1.6 million from December 31, 2020. Net income for the period was $10.1 million. Unrealized gains on investment securities, net of tax, declined by $5.3 million to a loss position as the yield curve continues to steepen. The Company repurchased 298,700 outstanding shares of common stock at an aggregate repurchase price of $2.6 million. The Company also paid $565,000 in dividends attributed to noncontrolling interest. See Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the noncontrolling interest. At December 31, 2021, the Company and its subsidiary bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nAllocation of Charge-Offs and Recoveries\n\nDividends\n\nLiquidity\nA discussion and analysis of the Company's operating results and financial condition are presented in the following narrative and financial tables. The comments are intended to supplement and should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing on pages through of this Annual Report. References to changes in assets and liabilities represent end-of-period balances unless otherwise noted. Statements contained in this Annual Report, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Amounts herein could vary because of market and other factors. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, factors discussed in documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission periodically. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d should,\u201d might,\u201d planned,\u201d estimated,\u201d potential,\u201d and similar words. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates with respect to the financial condition, expected or anticipated revenue, results of operations and business of the Company that are subject to various factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. These factors include, but are not limited to: the impact of the novel Coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, on our borrowers' ability to meet their financial obligations to us; increases in our past due loans and provisions for loan losses that may result from COVID-19; declines in general economic conditions, including increased stress in the financial markets due to COVID-19; changes in interest rates, deposit flows, loan demand, real estate values, and competition; changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines; changes in legislation or regulation; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting the Company's operations, pricing, products and services. Any use of we\u201d or our\u201d in the following discussion refers to the Company on a consolidated basis.\nLoan Portfolio Composition\n\nEarnings\n\nNet interest income increased $4.3 million to a total of $26.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from the $21.8 million earned in the same period of 2020. The average yield on our interest-earning assets decreased 8 basis points to 3.42%, while the average rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities decreased 18 basis points. These decreases resulted in a net increase of 11 basis\nOther consolidated liabilities decreased $2.1 million from $13.6 million at December 31, 2020 to $11.5 million at December 31, 2021. The valuation of mortgage banking derivatives decreased by $338,000. Other liabilities decreased by $1.8 million as a result of a reduction in the reserve for federal income tax and a decrease in supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities.\nFinancial Table 8\n\nItem 7.\nAll of the Company's aforementioned investment in its subsidiary bank qualifies for Tier 1 capital treatment for the Bank and is included as such in its year end capital ratios.\nNet Interest Income (Margin) is the single largest component of revenue for the Company. Net Interest Margin is the difference between the yield on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The margin can vary over time as interest rates change. The variance fluctuates based on both the timing (repricing) and magnitude of maturing assets and liabilities.\nTo identify interest rate sensitivity, a common measure is a gap analysis, which reflects the difference or gap\u201d between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various periods. While management reviews this information, it has implemented the use of an income simulation model, which calculates expected future Net Interest Income (Margin) based on projected interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and forecasted interest rates along with multiple other forecasted assumptions. Management believes this provides a more relevant view of interest rate risk sensitivity than the traditional gap analysis because the gap analysis ignores optionality embedded in the balance sheet, such as prepayments or changes based on interest rates. The income simulation model allows a comparison of flat, rising and falling rate scenarios to determine the interest rate sensitivity of earnings in varying interest rate environments.\n\nAsset Quality\nOn a regular basis, the allowance for loan losses is evaluated both individually and collectively by loan class. Homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated by loan class for impairment. However, once a loan is deemed impaired, it is evaluated individually for specific impairment. Appropriately dividing the loan portfolio into different segments with similar risk characteristics aids in providing a more accurate estimation of the portfolio's loss. The Company's methodology for estimating loan losses is well documented and supported by internal controls, and validation of the process is performed on a recurring basis.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of the losses that have been incurred in the loan portfolio but have not yet been charged-off. The allowance is a critical accounting estimate in the financial statements as it provides, by reference, an indication of the quality of the loan portfolio. Estimating credit losses is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Additional measurement uncertainty in the estimate is due, in part, to the large amount of data evaluated, the long-term nature of the underlying assets and the analysis of economic indicators. Regulatory examiners may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgement about information available to them at the time of their assessment.\nOther real estate owned remained at $0 through December 31, 2021, as there were no loans foreclosed on during the year.\nThe principal goals for asset liability management for the Company are to maintain adequate levels and sources of liquidity and to manage interest rate risk. Interest rate risk management attempts to balance the effects of interest rate changes on both interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities to protect Net Interest Income (Margin) from wide fluctuations as a result of changes in market interest rates. To that end, management has recommended and the board has approved policy limits that minimize the downside risk from interest rate shifts. The aforementioned ratios are within those stated limits of -18% for the respective modeled scenarios at the subsidiary bank and combined. Managing interest rate risk is an important factor to the long-term viability of the Company since Net Interest Income (Margin) is such a large component of earnings. The Company's Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) monitors market changes in interest rates and assists with the pricing of loans and deposit products while considering the funding source needs, asset growth projections, and necessary operating liquidity.\nThe Company has various financial instruments (outstanding commitments) with off-balance sheet risk that are issued in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. See Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these commitments and contingent liabilities.\nFinancial Table 2\nFinancial Table 1\nThe Company continues to maintain capital ratios that support its asset growth. In 2013, bank regulatory agencies approved regulatory capital guidelines ( Basel III\u201d) aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.50%, a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.00%, require a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.00%, and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. A capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, was also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer began phasing in on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.50% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the rules. The rules also revise the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, total capital, and risk-weighted assets.\nInvestment securities consist of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. Total investment securities increased $141.4 million, or 64.4%, from $219.7 million at December 31, 2020 to $361.1 million at December 31, 2021, due to investments of cash into longer-term, higher yielding assets. At December 31, 2021, the Company had net unrealized losses on securities available for sale of $1.5 million, compared to net unrealized gains of $5.4 million at December 31, 2020. The significant decline in fair value is directly related to the increase in market interest rates at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, as the market signals recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide.\n\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nFinancial Table 5\nAs with most financial institutions, the primary component of earnings for our subsidiary bank is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, principally from the loan and investment securities portfolios, and interest expense, principally on customer deposits and wholesale borrowings. Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume, spread and margin. For this purpose, volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as levels of noninterest bearing liabilities and capital.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nManagement uses a risk-grading program designed to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio. In this program, risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers then reviewed and monitored by credit administration. This process includes the maintenance of an internally classified loan list that is designed to help management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets, management considers, among other factors, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, the borrower's ability to repay, the borrower's payment history, and the current delinquent status. Because of this process, certain loans are deemed to be impaired and evaluated as an impaired loan.\nFinancial Table 9\nThe allowance, expressed as a percentage of gross loans held for investment, increased two basis points from 0.94% at December 31, 2020 to 0.96% at December 31, 2021. The collectively evaluated reserve allowance as a percentage of collectively evaluated loans was 0.93% at December 31, 2020 and 0.92% at December 31, 2020. The individually evaluated allowance as a percentage of individually evaluated loans increased from 1.81% to 4.54% for the same periods, a direct result of the $3.4 million net decrease in impaired loans during the year.\nOther Noninterest Expense\nWeighted Average Yield on Investments Securities\nLoan Servicing Assets\nAs discussed in Note 5 (Troubled Debt Restructures) of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the CARES Act allowed for loan modifications related to COVID-19 impacts to be excluded from TDR status. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no remaining COVID-19 modifications on outstanding loans.\n (1) Yields on securities and investments exempt from federal and/or state income taxes are stated on a fully tax-equivalent basis, assuming a 21.00% tax rate for 2021 and 2020. \nDuring the second quarter of 2020, management made adjustments to the allowance for loan losses methodology. The qualitative factors were expanded to include additional reserves for niche lending portfolios of hotel, retained interest in the unguaranteed portion of U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans (not including PPP loans), and SBA PPP loans. The risk in these portfolios is measurable, in addition to the standard probable loss calculation performed on all non-impaired loans. With the impact of COVID-19 on all industries, the hotel and SBA (non-PPP) loan categories on the Company's balance sheet have been identified as having elevated credit risk. The SBA (non-PPP) reflects the unguaranteed portion of SBA guaranteed loans originated by the Company. SBA PPP loans, while 100% guaranteed by SBA, could result in some loss if fraud occurs or there are reporting issues or duplicate funding of loans. In addition, management eliminated its qualitative factor based on a 21-day weighted average of the VIX index, a real-time index that measures the expectation of the market's 30-day forward-looking volatility, and replaced it with a multi-factor linear regression encompassing the following economic data: Case Shiller for North Carolina (NC) home price index, NC unemployment rate, 2-year/10-year US Treasury spread, customer sentiment, and a VIX quarterly average factor. During the third quarter of 2020, due to the lagging nature of the data (primarily unemployment data from U.S. government data) used in the multi-factor linear regression, management adopted an additional qualitative factor to incorporate more current unemployment data that was developed from non-governmental sources. The factor further represents the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and extended economic impacts. There were no significant adjustments to the allowance for loan losses methodology during 2021.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the Company sold a portion of an equity security investment bringing its principal value down to $270,000 at December 31, 2021 from $901,000 at December 30, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the unrealized gain on the investment totaled $122,000, resulting in a fair value of $392,000 for the security.", "item_7_text": "Financial Table 6\nThe portion of the Company's allowance for loan loss model related to general reserves captures the mean loss of individual loans within the loan portfolio and adds additional loss based on economic uncertainty and specific indicators of potential issues in the market. Specifically, the Company calculates probable losses on loans by computing a probability of loss and multiplying that by a loss given default derived from historical experience. An additional calculation based on economic uncertainty is added to the probable losses, thus deriving the estimated loss scenario by FDIC call report codes. Together, these expected components, as well as a reserve for qualitative factors based on management's discretion of economic conditions, form the basis of the allowance model. The loans that are impaired and included in the specific reserve are excluded from these calculations.\nThe Company had income tax expense of $2.8 million for 2021 at an effective tax rate of 21.51% compared to income tax expense of $2.3 million in 2020 with an effective tax rate of 22.38%. Income taxes computed at the statutory rate are affected primarily by the eligible amount of interest earned on state and municipal securities, tax-free municipal loans and income earned on bank-owned life insurance. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the effective tax rate decreased due to an additional tax accrual in the 2020 period related to a supplemental executive retirement plan distribution.\nCustomer deposits, our primary funding source, experienced a $93.6 million increase during the year, increasing from $743.2 million to $836.8 million at December 31, 2021, a 12.6% increase. In addition to receipt of government stimulus deposits, a large portion of\nAs of December 31, 2021, management believed the level of the allowance for loan losses was appropriate in light of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\n (1) Yields related to securities and loans exempt from federal and/or state income taxes are stated on a fully tax-equivalent basis, assuming a 21.00% tax rate for 2021, 2020 and 2019. \n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, short-term borrowings amounted to $1.1 million. Long-term debt at that date consisted solely of $29.5 million of junior subordinated debt. Other contractual obligations of the Company exist in the form of operating leases and deposits. Obligations for operating leases and deposits totaled $2.4 million and $836.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. Note 8 (Leases) and Note 9 (Deposits) to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information, including maturities, regarding these obligations.\nDuring 2021, the Company's net borrowings increased by $18.9 million. Borrowings consist of both short-term and long-term borrowed funds. The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no outstanding advances. Short-term borrowings consisted of $1.1 million in master notes, and long-term borrowings consisted solely of junior subordinated debt securities totaling $29.5 million at December 31, 2021. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company issued $10.0 million in subordinated debt securities with a final maturity date of September 30, 2029 that may be redeemed on or after September 30, 2024. This junior subordinated debt pays interest quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 5.25%. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company issued $12.0 million and $8.0 million of 10-year and 15-year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debt securities, respectively. The 10-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2031, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2026, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 3.5%. From and including September 3, 2026 to but excluding September 3, 2031, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 10-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus 283 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The 15-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2036, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2031, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 4.0%. From and including September 3, 2031 to but excluding September 3, 2036, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 15-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month SOFR plus 292 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The subordinated debt has been structured to qualify as and is included in the calculation of the Company's Tier 2 capital. The Company also has a $3.0 million line of credit of which $3.0 million was available to use at December 31, 2021.\nFinancial Table 3\npoints in our interest rate spread, from 3.04% in 2020 to 3.15% in 2021. Our net interest margin for 2021 was 3.23%, compared to 3.18% in 2020. As a part of the loan agreements, a portion of the Company's loan portfolio has interest rate floors and caps. The interest rate floor feature allows the Company to maintain a more favorable interest margin despite a decline in rates; however, the interest rate cap could hurt the margin in a rising rate environment. Financial Table 1 presents a detailed analysis of the components of the Company's net interest income, while Financial Table 2 summarizes the effects on net interest income from changes in interest rates and in the dollar volume of the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Financial Table 1 and Table 2, as well other Financial Tables referenced in this discussion and analysis, appear at the end of this annual report, immediately preceding the identification of the Company's board of directors and executive officers.\nThe above table analyzes the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table distinguishes between (i) changes attributable to volume (changes in volume multiplied by the prior period's rate), (ii) changes attributable to rate (changes in rate multiplied by the prior period's volume), and (iii) net change (the sum of the previous columns). The change attributable to both rate and volume (changes in rate multiplied by changes in volume) has been allocated equally to the change attributable to volume and the change attributable to rate.\nFinancial Table 10\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $33.1 million compared to $29.9 million for 2020, an increase of $3.2 million. Salaries and employee benefits, the largest component of noninterest expense, increased $1.8 million, from $19.9 million for the period ending December 31, 2020 to $21.6 million for 2021 to account for wage and benefit cost increases. Marketing and donations increased $334,000 as the Company makes a continued effort to support the communities we serve by giving back and supporting economic development and growth. Supplemental executive retirement plan expense increased $610,000 during 2021 to $942,000 due to market valuation adjustments. Financial Table 5 reflects the additional breakdown of other noninterest expense.\nFinancial Table 3\n</table>\nThe Company capitalizes mortgage and U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan servicing rights when loans are sold and the loan servicing is retained. Servicing revenue is recognized in the statement of income as a component of other noninterest income. The amortization of servicing rights is realized over the estimated period that net servicing revenues are expected to be received. Essential assumptions used to value the loan servicing rights include prepayment speeds, discount rates and costs to service the loan. Servicing assets are periodically evaluated for impairment based upon their fair value, and any resulting impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance and charged to other expense. An unrelated third party performs a quarterly valuation of the Company's Fannie Mae Mortgage Servicing Rights. Significant judgement is required to estimate the value of servicing rights due to the nature and variety of assumptions used. As such, changes in assumptions could materially affect the estimated value of loan servicing assets.\nThe allowance for loan loss was $4.0 million at December 31, 2021, which represents 0.96% of the total loans held for investment, a decrease of 8.6% from December 31, 2020. Additional discussion regarding the decrease in the allowance is included in the Asset Quality section below.\nTroubled debt restructured loans, a component of impaired loans, totaled $3.8 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $4.4 million at December 31, 2020. One relationship of $214,000 was added during the year, but this increase was offset by pay-offs and pay-downs totaling $876,000. At December 31, 2021, there was one troubled debt restructured loan in non-accrual status, which had a balance of $39,000.\nbelieves it has established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, there can be no assurance that banking regulators, in reviewing the Company's portfolio, will not require an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary, should the quality of any loans deteriorate because of the factors discussed herein. Unexpected global events, such as the unprecedented economic disruption due to COVID-19, are the type of future events that often cause material adjustments to the allowance to be necessary. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and the value of its securities.\n (1) Represents total of all outstanding loans in each category as a percent of total loans outstanding. \nThe Company's total assets increased $111.9 million from $827.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $939.7 million at December 31, 2021. The primary driver of this growth was an increase in customer deposits held by the Bank which was due, in large part, to our customers' receipt of government economic stimulus payments. This deposit growth was utilized to fund a substantial increase in the investment securities portfolio during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nSelected Loan Maturities\nThe recovery of loan losses was $917,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to a provision of $2.4 million for the same period in 2020. There were net loan recoveries of $541,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net loan recoveries of $34,000 during the same period of 2020. Refer to the Asset Quality section below for further information.\nThe phase-in period for the rules became effective for the Company and its subsidiary bank on January 1, 2015, with full compliance of all the rules' requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, becoming fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. Pursuant to the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, the Company is exempt from Basel III. As of December 31, 2021, the Company and its subsidiary bank continue to exceed minimum capital standards and remain well-capitalized under applicable capital adequacy rules.\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income Analysis\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company conducted a private placement offering of fixed rate junior subordinated debt securities at $1,000 per security with a required minimum investment of $50,000. The offering raised $10.0 million, of which the entire $10.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2021. These securities have a final maturity date of September 30, 2029 and may be redeemed by the Company after September 30, 2024. The junior subordinated debt pays interest quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 5.25%. All proceeds of this private placement qualify and are included in the calculation of Tier 2 capital. Once the final maturity drops under five years, the Company must impose a twenty percent annual reduction per year of the amount of the proceeds from the sale of these securities that are eligible to be counted as Tier 2 capital. The Company will have a twenty percent reduction beginning at September 30, 2024.\nThe Company models immediate rising and declining rate shocks of up to 4% (in 1% intervals) on its subsidiary bank, using a static balance sheet for a two-year horizon, as preferred by regulators. The most recent consolidated 2% rate shock projections for a one-year horizon, indicates a negative impact of (9.81%) on Net Interest Income (Margin) in a rates-down scenario and a positive impact of 10.69% on Net Interest Income (Margin) in a rates-up scenario. Based on the most recent twelve-month forecast, the subsidiary bank is asset-sensitive and may experience some negative impact to earnings should interest rates decline. While many interest-bearing assets would reprice in a declining interest rate environment; many liabilities are already approaching 0% interest rates. The subsidiary bank has the potential to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, but current market deposit pricing and embedded options in the balance sheet may limit the upside potential.\nOther changes in consolidated assets are primarily related to loan servicing assets, mortgage banking derivatives and other assets. Loan servicing assets increased $1.1 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 due to retention of servicing rights related to sustained sales of residential mortgage loans. The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives decreased $804,000 during 2021, and other assets decreased $1.3 million primarily due to the $1.1 million sale of an investment in a community development project.\nLoans held for investment decreased $47.0 million from $467.7 million at December 31, 2020 to $420.8 million at December 31, 2021. The main reason for the decline was a $60.6 million reduction in SBA PPP loans due to receipt of loan forgiveness. Not including SBA PPP loans, the Company experienced net growth overall with the largest increase occurring in the commercial segment. During 2021 the Company funded 879 SBA PPP Round 2 loans for a total of $46.4 million. These loans are unsecured commercial loans, but are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. These new SBA PPP loans, however, were offset by forgiveness and payoffs of $80.4 million on SBA PPP loans originally funded during 2020 and forgiveness and payoffs of $31.1 million of SBA PPP Round 2 loans. Loans held for sale increased 211.6%, or $14.7 million, as many of the closed loans are being held longer in an effort to earn additional interest income before selling the loans on the secondary market.\nThe objective of the Company's liquidity management policy is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on any opportunities for expansion. Liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise. Liquidity is managed primarily by the selection of asset mix and the maturity mix of liabilities. Maturities and the marketability of securities and other funding sources provide a source of liquidity to meet deposit fluctuations. Maturities in the securities portfolio, presented in Financial Table 3, are supported by cash flows from mortgage-backed securities that have longer-term contractual maturities. The Company's other sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans and cash flows generated from operation. Growth in deposits is typically the primary source of funds for loan growth, supported by long-term credit available from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The Company and its subsidiary bank have multiple funding sources, in addition to deposits, that can be used to increase liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility. Other funding sources at year-end 2021 included $43.0 million in federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks and approximately $93.8 million of credit availability from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The Company may also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window with credit availability of $17.6 million.\nThe Company expects to continue to exceed required minimum capital ratios without altering current operations or strategy. Note 15 (Shareholders' Equity and Regulatory Matters) to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presents additional information regarding the Company's and its subsidiary bank's capital ratios.\nUwharrie Capital Corp reported net income of $10.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $8.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.0 million. Net income available to common shareholders was $9.5 million, or $1.33 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $7.5 million, or $1.03 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net income available to common shareholders is net income less any dividends paid on the aforementioned noncontrolling interest.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nthis increase is related to the funding of SBA PPP Round 2 loans, some of the proceeds of which were deposited by our customers into their deposit accounts held at the Company's subsidiary bank. Demand noninterest-bearing checking accounts increased $33.6 million, interest checking and money market accounts increased by $41.4 million and savings deposits increased $28.5 million during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. Time deposits decreased $10.1 million during the same period as customers transitioned to liquid accounts.\nManagement believes that the Company's current sources of funds provide adequate liquidity for its current cash flow needs.\nThe Company assesses the probability of losses inherent in the loan portfolio using probability of default data derived from the Company's internal historical data, representing a one-year loss horizon for each obligor. Credit scores are used within the model to determine the probability of default. The Company updates the credit scores for individuals that either have a loan, or are financially responsible for the loan, semi-annually, during the first and third quarters. During 2021, the average effective credit score of the portfolio, excluding loans in default, decreased slightly from 768 to 767. The probability of default associated with each credit score is a major driver in the allowance for loan losses.\nDuring the third quarter of 2013, the Company's subsidiary bank raised an additional $2.8 million of Fixed Rate Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C. The preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital at the bank and pays dividends at an annual rate of 5.30%. The preferred stock has no voting rights. The offering raised $2.8 million less issuance costs of $23,000.\n (1) Yields on securities and investments exempt from federal and/or state income taxes are stated on a fully tax-equivalent basis, assuming a 21.00% tax rate for 2021 and 2020. \nAt December 31, 2021, the levels of our impaired loans, which includes all loans in non-accrual status, TDRs, and other loans deemed by management to be impaired, were $4.7 million, compared to $8.2 million at December 31, 2020, a net decrease of $3.4 million. The decrease is related to four large impaired loans paying off in during 2021. Three of these large impaired relationships were loans in non-accrual status. As a result, non-accrual loans decreased from $3.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $972,000 at December 31, 2021.\nThe following table shows the comparison of nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe Company generates most of its revenue from net interest income; however, diversification of our earnings base is a key strategic initiative to our long-term success. Noninterest income decreased 9.3%, from $20.9 million in 2020, to $18.9 million in 2021, a decrease of $1.9 million. The primary factor contributing to the decrease was a decline in income from mortgage loan sales as production began to level out after the surge in refinancing caused by the lower interest rate environment during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The gain on sale of securities increased by $920,000 to $991,000 at December 31, 2021, compared to $77,000 at December 31, 2020. This gain served to offset the decline in income from mortgage banking as the Company worked to reduce the duration of the investment portfolio in an attempt to protect capital as long-term interest rates rise.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Board of Directors of Uwharrie Capital Corp declared a 3% stock dividend in 2021 and 2% stock dividend in both 2020 and 2019.

The allowance is increased by provisions charged to operations and recoveries of amounts previously charged off and is reduced by recovery of provisions and charge offs of loans. Management continuously evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance, management considers the following: the growth, composition and industry diversification of the portfolio; historical loan loss experience; current delinquency levels; adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay; estimated value of any underlying collateral; prevailing economic conditions; and other relevant factors. The Company's credit administration function, through a review process, periodically validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment. In addition, as a given loan's credit quality improves or deteriorates, the credit administration department has the responsibility to change the borrower's risk grade accordingly. For loans determined to be impaired, the allowance is based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the selling costs. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans, which may be susceptible to significant change. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require additions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management.\nWeighted Average Yield on Investments Securities (Continued)\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company issued $12.0 million and $8.0 million of 10-year and 15-year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debt securities, respectively. The 10-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2031, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2026, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 3.5%. From and including September 3, 2026 to but excluding September 3, 2031, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 10-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month SOFR plus 283 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The 15-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2036, though redeemable on or after September 3, 2031, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 4.0%. From and including September 3, 2031 to but excluding September 3, 2036, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate on the 15-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month SOFR plus 292 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The subordinated debt has been structured to qualify as and is included in the calculation of the Company's Tier 2 capital. Once the final maturity drops under five years, the Company must impose a twenty percent annual reduction per year of the amount of the proceeds from the sale of these securities that are eligible to be counted as Tier 2 capital. The Company will have a twenty percent reduction beginning at September 3, 2026 and September 3, 2031 for the 10-year and 15-year subordinated notes, respectively.\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. What makes these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex is the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about these and other accounting policies utilized by the Company.\nFinancial Table 7\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of an appropriate amount to provide for probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business. While management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while management\nThe ratio of nonperforming loans, which consists of non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing, to total loans decreased significantly from 0.80% at December 31, 2020, to 0.23% at December 31, 2021. This improvement is attributable to the previously mentioned payoffs of three large non-accrual loans.\nNoninterest Expense\nMaturities of Time Deposits\nAt December 31, 2021, total shareholders' equity was $60.8 million, an increase of $1.6 million from December 31, 2020. Net income for the period was $10.1 million. Unrealized gains on investment securities, net of tax, declined by $5.3 million to a loss position as the yield curve continues to steepen. The Company repurchased 298,700 outstanding shares of common stock at an aggregate repurchase price of $2.6 million. The Company also paid $565,000 in dividends attributed to noncontrolling interest. See Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the noncontrolling interest. At December 31, 2021, the Company and its subsidiary bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nAllocation of Charge-Offs and Recoveries\n\nDividends\n\nLiquidity\nA discussion and analysis of the Company's operating results and financial condition are presented in the following narrative and financial tables. The comments are intended to supplement and should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing on pages through of this Annual Report. References to changes in assets and liabilities represent end-of-period balances unless otherwise noted. Statements contained in this Annual Report, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Amounts herein could vary because of market and other factors. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, factors discussed in documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission periodically. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d should,\u201d might,\u201d planned,\u201d estimated,\u201d potential,\u201d and similar words. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates with respect to the financial condition, expected or anticipated revenue, results of operations and business of the Company that are subject to various factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. These factors include, but are not limited to: the impact of the novel Coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, on our borrowers' ability to meet their financial obligations to us; increases in our past due loans and provisions for loan losses that may result from COVID-19; declines in general economic conditions, including increased stress in the financial markets due to COVID-19; changes in interest rates, deposit flows, loan demand, real estate values, and competition; changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines; changes in legislation or regulation; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting the Company's operations, pricing, products and services. Any use of we\u201d or our\u201d in the following discussion refers to the Company on a consolidated basis.\nLoan Portfolio Composition\n\nEarnings\n\nNet interest income increased $4.3 million to a total of $26.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from the $21.8 million earned in the same period of 2020. The average yield on our interest-earning assets decreased 8 basis points to 3.42%, while the average rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities decreased 18 basis points. These decreases resulted in a net increase of 11 basis\nOther consolidated liabilities decreased $2.1 million from $13.6 million at December 31, 2020 to $11.5 million at December 31, 2021. The valuation of mortgage banking derivatives decreased by $338,000. Other liabilities decreased by $1.8 million as a result of a reduction in the reserve for federal income tax and a decrease in supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities.\nFinancial Table 8\n\nItem 7.\nAll of the Company's aforementioned investment in its subsidiary bank qualifies for Tier 1 capital treatment for the Bank and is included as such in its year end capital ratios.\nNet Interest Income (Margin) is the single largest component of revenue for the Company. Net Interest Margin is the difference between the yield on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The margin can vary over time as interest rates change. The variance fluctuates based on both the timing (repricing) and magnitude of maturing assets and liabilities.\nTo identify interest rate sensitivity, a common measure is a gap analysis, which reflects the difference or gap\u201d between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various periods. While management reviews this information, it has implemented the use of an income simulation model, which calculates expected future Net Interest Income (Margin) based on projected interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and forecasted interest rates along with multiple other forecasted assumptions. Management believes this provides a more relevant view of interest rate risk sensitivity than the traditional gap analysis because the gap analysis ignores optionality embedded in the balance sheet, such as prepayments or changes based on interest rates. The income simulation model allows a comparison of flat, rising and falling rate scenarios to determine the interest rate sensitivity of earnings in varying interest rate environments.\n\nAsset Quality\nOn a regular basis, the allowance for loan losses is evaluated both individually and collectively by loan class. Homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated by loan class for impairment. However, once a loan is deemed impaired, it is evaluated individually for specific impairment. Appropriately dividing the loan portfolio into different segments with similar risk characteristics aids in providing a more accurate estimation of the portfolio's loss. The Company's methodology for estimating loan losses is well documented and supported by internal controls, and validation of the process is performed on a recurring basis.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of the losses that have been incurred in the loan portfolio but have not yet been charged-off. The allowance is a critical accounting estimate in the financial statements as it provides, by reference, an indication of the quality of the loan portfolio. Estimating credit losses is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Additional measurement uncertainty in the estimate is due, in part, to the large amount of data evaluated, the long-term nature of the underlying assets and the analysis of economic indicators. Regulatory examiners may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgement about information available to them at the time of their assessment.\nOther real estate owned remained at $0 through December 31, 2021, as there were no loans foreclosed on during the year.\nThe principal goals for asset liability management for the Company are to maintain adequate levels and sources of liquidity and to manage interest rate risk. Interest rate risk management attempts to balance the effects of interest rate changes on both interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities to protect Net Interest Income (Margin) from wide fluctuations as a result of changes in market interest rates. To that end, management has recommended and the board has approved policy limits that minimize the downside risk from interest rate shifts. The aforementioned ratios are within those stated limits of -18% for the respective modeled scenarios at the subsidiary bank and combined. Managing interest rate risk is an important factor to the long-term viability of the Company since Net Interest Income (Margin) is such a large component of earnings. The Company's Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) monitors market changes in interest rates and assists with the pricing of loans and deposit products while considering the funding source needs, asset growth projections, and necessary operating liquidity.\nThe Company has various financial instruments (outstanding commitments) with off-balance sheet risk that are issued in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. See Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these commitments and contingent liabilities.\nFinancial Table 2\nFinancial Table 1\nThe Company continues to maintain capital ratios that support its asset growth. In 2013, bank regulatory agencies approved regulatory capital guidelines ( Basel III\u201d) aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.50%, a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.00%, require a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.00%, and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. A capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, was also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer began phasing in on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.50% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the rules. The rules also revise the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, total capital, and risk-weighted assets.\nInvestment securities consist of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. Total investment securities increased $141.4 million, or 64.4%, from $219.7 million at December 31, 2020 to $361.1 million at December 31, 2021, due to investments of cash into longer-term, higher yielding assets. At December 31, 2021, the Company had net unrealized losses on securities available for sale of $1.5 million, compared to net unrealized gains of $5.4 million at December 31, 2020. The significant decline in fair value is directly related to the increase in market interest rates at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, as the market signals recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide.\n\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nFinancial Table 5\nAs with most financial institutions, the primary component of earnings for our subsidiary bank is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, principally from the loan and investment securities portfolios, and interest expense, principally on customer deposits and wholesale borrowings. Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume, spread and margin. For this purpose, volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as levels of noninterest bearing liabilities and capital.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nManagement uses a risk-grading program designed to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio. In this program, risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers then reviewed and monitored by credit administration. This process includes the maintenance of an internally classified loan list that is designed to help management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets, management considers, among other factors, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, the borrower's ability to repay, the borrower's payment history, and the current delinquent status. Because of this process, certain loans are deemed to be impaired and evaluated as an impaired loan.\nFinancial Table 9\nThe allowance, expressed as a percentage of gross loans held for investment, increased two basis points from 0.94% at December 31, 2020 to 0.96% at December 31, 2021. The collectively evaluated reserve allowance as a percentage of collectively evaluated loans was 0.93% at December 31, 2020 and 0.92% at December 31, 2020. The individually evaluated allowance as a percentage of individually evaluated loans increased from 1.81% to 4.54% for the same periods, a direct result of the $3.4 million net decrease in impaired loans during the year.\nOther Noninterest Expense\nWeighted Average Yield on Investments Securities\nLoan Servicing Assets\nAs discussed in Note 5 (Troubled Debt Restructures) of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the CARES Act allowed for loan modifications related to COVID-19 impacts to be excluded from TDR status. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no remaining COVID-19 modifications on outstanding loans.\n (1) Yields on securities and investments exempt from federal and/or state income taxes are stated on a fully tax-equivalent basis, assuming a 21.00% tax rate for 2021 and 2020. \nDuring the second quarter of 2020, management made adjustments to the allowance for loan losses methodology. The qualitative factors were expanded to include additional reserves for niche lending portfolios of hotel, retained interest in the unguaranteed portion of U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans (not including PPP loans), and SBA PPP loans. The risk in these portfolios is measurable, in addition to the standard probable loss calculation performed on all non-impaired loans. With the impact of COVID-19 on all industries, the hotel and SBA (non-PPP) loan categories on the Company's balance sheet have been identified as having elevated credit risk. The SBA (non-PPP) reflects the unguaranteed portion of SBA guaranteed loans originated by the Company. SBA PPP loans, while 100% guaranteed by SBA, could result in some loss if fraud occurs or there are reporting issues or duplicate funding of loans. In addition, management eliminated its qualitative factor based on a 21-day weighted average of the VIX index, a real-time index that measures the expectation of the market's 30-day forward-looking volatility, and replaced it with a multi-factor linear regression encompassing the following economic data: Case Shiller for North Carolina (NC) home price index, NC unemployment rate, 2-year/10-year US Treasury spread, customer sentiment, and a VIX quarterly average factor. During the third quarter of 2020, due to the lagging nature of the data (primarily unemployment data from U.S. government data) used in the multi-factor linear regression, management adopted an additional qualitative factor to incorporate more current unemployment data that was developed from non-governmental sources. The factor further represents the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and extended economic impacts. There were no significant adjustments to the allowance for loan losses methodology during 2021.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the Company sold a portion of an equity security investment bringing its principal value down to $270,000 at December 31, 2021 from $901,000 at December 30, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the unrealized gain on the investment totaled $122,000, resulting in a fair value of $392,000 for the security.", "item_7_tables": "Table 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
