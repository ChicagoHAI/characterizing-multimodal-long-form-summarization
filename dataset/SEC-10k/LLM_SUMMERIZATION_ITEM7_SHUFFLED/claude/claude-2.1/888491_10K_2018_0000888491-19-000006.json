Our core business is to provide financing and capital to the long-term healthcare industry with a particular focus on skilled nursing facilities ( SNFs\u201d), and, to a lesser extent, assisted living facilities ( ALFs\u201d), independent living facilities ( ILFs\u201d) and rehabilitation and acute care facilities. Our core portfolio consists of long-term leases and mortgage agreements. All of our leases are triple-net\u201d leases, which require the operators (we use the term operator\u201d to refer to our tenants and mortgagors and their affiliates who manage and/or operate our properties) to pay all property-related expenses. Our mortgage revenue derives from fixed rate mortgage loans, which are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor.\nOur portfolio of investments at December 31, 2018, included 924 healthcare facilities, located in 41 states and the U.K. that are operated by 68 third-party operators. Our real estate investment in these facilities totaled approximately $8.6 billion at December 31, 2018, with 99% of our real estate investments related to long-term healthcare facilities. The portfolio is made up of (i) 735 SNFs, (ii) 116 ALFs, (iii) 14 specialty facilities, (iv) one medical office building, (v) fixed rate mortgages on 51 SNFs and three ALFs and (vi) four SNFs that are currently closed or held for sale. At December 31, 2018, we held other investments of approximately $504.6 million, consisting primarily of secured loans to third-party operators of our facilities and a $31.0 million investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of (i) Omega, (ii) Omega OP, and (iii) all direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Omega OP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nAs healthcare delivery continues to evolve, we continuously evaluate our assets, our operators and our markets to position our portfolio for long-term success. Our strategy includes applying data analytics to enhance facility operations, investment underwriting and asset management, as well as selling or transitioning assets that do not meet our portfolio criteria.\nAlthough industry occupancy levels have declined in recent years, the occupancy levels of our facilities and our operator coverages remained stable overall for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018. Our operators continue to experience increased labor costs which we believe is manageable. In addition, our operators continue to see declines in their overall quality mix (Medicare and private pay) as a percentage of operator revenue, which has been driven principally by managed care pressure on lengths of stay and rates. Texas, which represents 10% of our investments as of December 31, 2018, presents a difficult operating environment for SNF operators as a result of lower statewide occupancy levels and a Medicaid rate reimbursement that we believe is among the lowest in the United States. A number of our operators have experienced lower operating margins on their SNFs in Texas as a result of the foregoing and labor costs. The acquisition of MedEquities will increase the percentage of our investments in Texas. We believe the long-term outlook in Texas is positive with favorable demographics, limited new supply, the implementation of the PDPM, and the possibility of Medicaid rate relief.\nWe currently believe that our operators can generally meet their obligations to us, except us as discussed below. However, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an operator's results of operations and financial condition, which could adversely affect the operator's ability to meet its obligations to us.\nWe believe that our operating results display the strength of our conservative balance sheet and operating model against the backdrop of a dynamic operating environment. We believe our operators will generally benefit from the October 2019 change in the Medicare prospective payment system from RUG-IV (driven by therapy volume) to the PDPM (driven by patient disease conditions), as well as from the projected growth in elderly demographics in the years to come. Increasing labor and liability costs, evolving reimbursement models, and localized occupancy trends may put near term financial strain on some operators within the skilled nursing industry, particularly in states with unfavorable Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n2018 and Recent Highlights\nAcquisition and Other Investments\nIn 2018, we completed the following transactions totaling approximately $471 million in new investments:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$131.3 million secured term loan with an unrelated third party. The loan is secured by a collateral assignment of mortgages covering seven SNFs, three ILFs and one ALF located in Pennsylvania and Virginia. The loan bears an interest rate of 9.35%.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Omega will acquire MedEquities and MedEquities will be merged with and into Omega (the Merger\u201d) at the effective time of the Merger with Omega continuing as the surviving company. At the effective time, each outstanding share of MedEquities common stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.235 of a share of Omega common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) $2.00 in cash, without interest, subject to adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement under certain limited circumstances. As of December 31, 2018, the total consideration expected to be exchanged in the merger, including the assumption of debt is approximately $600 million. The Merger Agreement also provides that MedEquities will declare a special dividend of $0.21 per share of MedEquities common stock payable to the holders of record of MedEquities common stock as of the trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger, which dividend will be payable following the effective time of the Merger together with the cash consideration under the Merger Agreement.\nFinancing Activities\nHUD Mortgage Disposition\nOn June 1, 2018, subsidiaries of an existing operator assumed approximately $53 million of our indebtedness guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d) that secured 12 separate facilities located in Arkansas. In connection with our disposition of the mortgages we wrote-off approximately $0.6 million of unamortized deferred costs that are recorded in Gain on assets sold - net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These fixed rate mortgages had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.06% per annum and matured in July 2044.\nPortfolio and Other Developments\nThe following tables summarize the

</tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, we acquired two parcels of land (not reflected in the table above) for approximately $3.5 million with the intent of building new facilities for our existing operators.\nDuring 2018, we transitioned 21 SNFs and one ALF subject to direct financing leases (not reflected in the table above) with a net carrying value of approximately $184.5 million from an existing operator to five other existing operators subject to single or master operating leases with an initial annual cash yield of approximately 9%. We recorded approximately $184.5 million of real estate investments consisting of land ($11.2 million), building and site improvements ($159.1 million) and furniture and fixtures ($14.2 million) in partial satisfaction of the direct financing lease. In connection with these transitions, we provided the new operators with working capital loans with a maximum borrowing capacity of $45.7 million, commitments to fund capital improvements up to $10.6 million and indemnities with a maximum funding of $7.4 million. Claims against these indemnities must occur within 18 months to 36 months of the transition date. These indemnities were provided to the new operators upon transition and would be utilized in the event that the prior operator does not perform under their transition agreements.

No goodwill was recorded in connection with these acquisitions.\nAsset Sales, Impairments, Accounts Receivable and Other\nAsset Sales\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have completed substantially all of our strategic asset repositions and portfolio restructuring. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold 14 facilities (nine previously held for sale at September 30, 2018) subject to operating leases for approximately $63.2 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $15.5 million.\nIn 2018, we sold 78 facilities (22 previously held for sale at December 31, 2017) subject to operating leases for approximately $309.6 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $24.8 million.\nOf the 78 facilities sold during 2018, we sold 12 SNFs on June 1, 2018 secured by HUD mortgages to subsidiaries of an existing operator. The Company sold the 12 SNF facilities with carrying values of approximately $62 million for approximately $78 million which consisted of $25 million of cash consideration and their assumption of approximately $53 million of our HUD mortgages. Simultaneously, subsidiaries of the operator assumed our HUD restricted cash accounts, deposits and escrows. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $11 million after approximately $5 million of closing and other transaction related costs. In connection with this sale, we provided a principal of an existing operator an unsecured loan of approximately $39.7 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold 32 facilities (two previously held for sale at September 30, 2017) subject to operating leases for approximately $188.0 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $46.4 million.\nIn 2017, we sold 52 facilities (14 previously held for sale at December 31, 2016) subject to operating leases for approximately $257.8 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $53.9 million.\nOf the 52 facilities sold in 2017, the sale of ten of these facilities did not initially qualify for sale accounting under the full accrual method. The ten SNFs with a carrying value of approximately $23.2 million were sold to a third-party for approximately $43.3 million, resulting in a total gain of approximately $17.5 million after $2.6 million of closing costs. In connection with this sale, we provided the buyer a $10.0 million loan which was recorded in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized a net gain of approximately $7.5 million in 2017 and deferred $10.0 million of gain related to this sale. Upon our adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) on January 1, 2018, we recognized $10.0 million of deferred gain related to this sale through opening equity on January 1, 2018.\nIn 2016, we sold 38 facilities (three previously held for sale at December 31, 2015) subject to operating leases for approximately $169.6 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $50.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2018, three facilities, totaling approximately $1.0 million are classified as assets held for sale. We expect to sell these facilities over the next twelve months.\nImpairments\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $3.2 million on three facilities (two were subsequently reclassified to held for sale).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $35.0 million on 35 facilities. Our impairments were offset by $5.2 million of insurance proceeds received related to a facility destroyed in November 2017. The total net recorded investment in these properties after impairments and excluding facilities previously sold was approximately $14.8 million as of December 31, 2018, with approximately $1.0 million related to properties classified as held for sale.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $63.5 million on 32 facilities (two were subsequently reclassified to held for sale). Of the $63.5 million impairment on real estate properties, $12.6 million related to one facility that was destroyed in a fire.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $99.1 million on 37 facilities including approximately $2.6 million of capitalized costs associated with the termination of construction projects with two of our operators. The total net recorded investment in these properties after impairments and excluding facilities previously sold was approximately $125.1 million as of December 31, 2017, with approximately $7.7 million related to properties classified as held for sale.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $58.7 million on 29 facilities.\nOur 2018, 2017 and 2016 recorded impairments were primarily the result of decisions to exit certain non-strategic facilities and/or operators. We reduced the net book value of the impaired facilities to their estimated fair values or, with respect to the facilities reclassified to assets held for sale, to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. To estimate the fair value of the facilities, we utilized a market approach which considered binding sale agreements (a Level 1 input) and/or Level 3 inputs which generally consist of non-binding offers from unrelated third parties.\nAccounts Receivable\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $33.8 million of contractual receivables outstanding - net of allowances. Of the $33.8 million of contractual receivables outstanding - net of allowances, approximately $18.3 million relates to Agemo Holdings LLC ( Agemo\u201d an entity formed in May 2018 to silo the leases and loans formerly held by Signature Healthcare) and Daybreak Venture LLC ( Daybreak\u201d). Daybreak is on a cash basis of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition, see additional discussion below. In addition to the contractual receivables, we have approximately $43.5 million of straight-line rent receivables and/or lease inducements associated with these operators as of December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded approximately $83.2 million and $82.6 million, of rental income, respectively, and $3.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of other investment income from these operators. Additionally, $5.4 million of the $33.8 million of contractual receivables outstanding - net of allowances as of December 31, 2018, relates to one operator that continues to pay, although at times less than the monthly contractual rent due. We continue to monitor this operator, including their contractual payments and their operational performance to determine if it will impact our revenue recognition in future periods.\nOrianna\nIn addition to our direct financing leases with Orianna Health Systems ( Orianna\u201d), we own three facilities and had leased them to Orianna under a master lease which was to expire in 2026. The remaining three facility lease is accounted for as an operating lease. Our recorded investment in the three facilities subject to this operating lease was $30.5 million as of December 31, 2018. On October 31, 2018, Orianna rejected the operating lease and as a result we transitioned the remaining three facilities to an existing operator during the first quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we also have a revolving working capital loan issued to Orianna with a balance outstanding as of December 31, 2018 of $15.2 million.\nIn 2017, we sold eight facilities subject to direct financing leases with Orianna in the Northwest region and the Southeast region of the U.S. with a carrying value of approximately $36.4 million for approximately $33.3 million to unrelated third parties. We recorded approximately $3.3 million of impairment related to these sales. In addition, we transitioned nine SNFs, representing all of the facilities subject to another direct financing lease with Orianna in the Texas region, to an existing operator of ours pursuant to an operating lease. In connection with this transaction, we recorded the real estate properties at our original cost basis of approximately $19.0 million, eliminated our investment in the Texas region direct financing lease and recorded an impairment of approximately $1.8 million. In conjunction with this transaction, we also amended our Orianna Southeast region master lease to reduce the outstanding balance by $19.3 million. As a result of the lease amendment in 2017, we recorded impairment on our investment in direct financing lease of approximately $20.8 million in 2017.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we recorded an allowance for loss on direct financing leases of $172.2 million with Orianna covering 38 facilities in the Southeast region of the U.S. The amount of the allowance was determined based on the fair value of the facilities subject to the direct financing lease. To estimate the fair value of the underlying collateral, we utilized an income approach and Level 3 inputs. Our estimate of fair value assumed annual rents ranging between $32.0 million and $38.0 million, rental yields between 9% and 10%, current and projected operating performance of the facilities, coverage ratios and bed values. Our recorded investment in these direct financing leases, net of the $172.2 million of allowances, amounted to $337.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nIn March 2018, Orianna commenced voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). As described in Orianna's filings with the Bankruptcy Court, we entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement ( RSA\u201d) that was expected to form the basis for Orianna's restructuring. The RSA provided for the recommencement, in April 2018, of partial rent payments at $1.0 million per month and established a specific timeline for the implementation of Orianna's planned restructuring. The RSA provided for the transition of 23 facilities to new operators and the potential sale of the remaining 19 facilities subject to the plan of reorganization (the Plan\u201d), if approved by the Bankruptcy Court.\nTo provide liquidity to Orianna during their Chapter 11 proceedings, we entered into a senior secured superpriority debtor-in-possession ( DIP\u201d) credit agreement with Orianna for a revolving credit and term loan DIP financing of up to $30 million, which DIP financing was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on an interim basis on March 9, 2018 and on a final basis on May 14, 2018.\nOn July 23, 2018, we notified Orianna that it was in default under the DIP credit agreement. On July 25, 2018, Omega terminated the RSA with its tenant, 4 West Holdings, and the sponsor of Orianna's Plan.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we transitioned 22 facilities with a net carrying value of approximately $184.5 million from Orianna to five other existing operators with annual contractual rent of approximately $16.8 million. In addition, during the second half of 2018, we sold Orianna's headquarters and one SNF with a carrying value of approximately $5.5 million to unrelated third-parties for approximately $5.5 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that Orianna's Plan, if confirmed, would allow Orianna to use the value of Orianna's remaining facilities to pay the administrative costs of Orianna's Chapter 11 cases and to pay certain other creditor claims, with the net amount of such value being paid to us. As a result, we recorded $27.2 million in additional allowance for loss to reduce the remaining investment in the direct financing lease covering the remaining 15 facilities located in the Southeast region of the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, our net investment in the Orianna direct financing lease is approximately $120.5 million, net of an allowance of $103.2 million.\nOn January 11, 2019, pursuant to a Bankruptcy Court order, affiliates of Orianna purchased the remaining 15 SNFs subject to the direct financing lease with Orianna for $176 million of consideration, comprised of $146 million in cash received by Orianna and a $30.0 million seller note held by the Company. The $30.0 million note bears interest at 6% per annum and matures on January 11, 2026. Interest on the unpaid principal balance is due quarterly in arrears. Commencing on January 11, 2022, quarterly principal payments are due based on a 15-year amortization schedule on the then outstanding principal balance of the loan. On the same date, Orianna repaid the DIP financing, including all related interest.\nOn January 16, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Orianna's Plan, creating a Distribution Trust (the Trust\u201d) to distribute the proceeds from Orianna's sale of the remaining 15 SNFs, as well as the Trust's collections of Orianna's accounts receivable portfolio. Our remaining investment in the direct financing lease and the revolving working capital loan as of December 31, 2018 is expected to be recovered through liquidating payments made from the Trust. The Trust is comprised of $115.8 million of net cash proceeds from the sale by Orianna of the 15 SNFs on January 11, 2019 after repayment of the DIP financing, cash of $5.6 million, and accounts receivable, net of estimated allowance, of $21.3 million. We expect that the aggregate of such amounts will be used to pay the estimated costs of $26.9 million to other creditors and to wind down the Trust with the remainder paid to us under the direct financing leases and on account of the revolving working capital loan. The amount payable to us is contingent upon the collection of the accounts receivable balances and the estimated costs to wind down the Trust. These amounts are estimated and subject to change. Such changes could be significantly different than the currently estimated amounts and such differences could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOn February 13, 2019, we received $78.8 million from the Trust as a partial liquidation of the Trust. We will receive other payments from the Trust when the accounts receivable are collected and as the estimated creditor claims and costs to wind down the Trust are finalized.\nAs a result of Orianna not satisfying the contractual payments due under the terms of the direct financing leases or the separate operating lease and the uncertainty of collection, we have not recognized any income from Orianna related to the direct financing leases or the operating lease for the period from July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018.\nAgemo\nOn May 7, 2018, Omega and Signature Healthcare entered into a consensual, out-of-court restructuring agreement. The restructuring involves multiple third-party constituents, including other third-party landlords, a new working capital lender, medical malpractice claimants, and other third-party interests. As part of the restructuring, Signature Healthcare was reorganized to separate each of its primary portfolios with its major landlords into three distinct lease silos and separate virtually all other legal obligations. As part of this restructuring, Signature Healthcare formed Agemo Holdings LLC ( Agemo\u201d) to be the holding company of the leases and loans of ours, and for which we agreed to:\nTable 164: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndefer up to $6.3 million of rent per annum for 3 years commencing May 1, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nprovide capital expenditure funds to be used for the general maintenance and capital improvements of our 58 facilities in the amount of approximately $4.5 million per year for 3 years;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nextend a 7-year working capital term loan at 7% for an amount up to $25 million with a maturity date of April 30, 2025 ($14.3 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2018);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nextend the term of the master lease by two years to December 31, 2030 and;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nextend the maturity date of the existing term loan by two years to December 31, 2024.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of the restructuring, Signature Healthcare entered into new working capital credit facilities with its new working capital lender for each of its separate silos, including Agemo. In addition, as part of our restructure, certain third-party guarantors of the Agemo master lease were required to contribute approximately $7.8 million in funds to the enterprise to be used to reduce the outstanding contractual receivables owed to us from Agemo. On May 8, 2018, we received $5.0 million in cash from the guarantors and a one-year term note from the principals of Agemo for approximately $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2018, Agemo is paying rent and interest pursuant to our lease and loan agreements.\nDaybreak\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we placed Daybreak on a cash basis for revenue recognition as a result of nonpayment. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we executed a Settlement and Forbearance Agreement with Daybreak which permitted Daybreak to defer payments of up to 23% of their contractual rent for the remainder of 2017, subject to certain conditions. Daybreak was in compliance with the agreement at September 30, 2018; however, during the fourth quarter of 2018, Daybreak fell behind on rent by approximately two months and accordingly was not in compliance with the 2017 Settlement and Forbearance Agreement as a result of not paying the full contractual amounts due.\nAs a direct result of the challenges presented by the current operating environment in Texas as discussed under Overview and Outlook above, Daybreak requested further rent deferral. On January 30, 2019, we entered into a Second Amendment to Settlement and Forbearance Agreement under which we agreed to defer approximately $4.2 million of rent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and approximately $2.5 million (or approximately one month's rent) in each of the first two quarters of 2019. We believe these rent deferrals position Daybreak to continue to embark on certain operational improvements and to provide Daybreak time to receive the benefits of a significant increased participation in a Texas program providing SNF operators enhanced reimbursement for quality of care in its nursing facilities.\nOther\nWe continue to closely monitor the performance of all of our operators, as well as industry trends and developments generally.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any material properties or operators with facilities that are not materially occupied.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is our discussion of the consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity and capital resources, which should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, were $881.7 million, a decrease of $26.7 million over the same period in 2017.

The $8.2 million decrease was primarily the result of a $22.0 million decrease in interest refinancing costs related to early extinguishment costs incurred in 2017 to redeem the $400 million 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 and the write-off of deferred costs related to the 2014 credit facility, offset by a $10.4 million contractual settlement with an unrelated third party related to a contingent liability obligation that originated in 2012 that was resolved in the first quarter of 2017 and a $3.7 million increase in interest expense related to higher debt balances outstanding to fund new investments and higher blended borrowing costs in 2018.\n2018 Taxes\nBecause we qualify as a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income taxes on the REIT taxable income that we distribute to stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. For tax year 2018, we made common dividend payments of $528.7 million to satisfy REIT requirements relating to qualifying income. Subject to the limitation under the REIT asset test rules, we are permitted to own up to 100% of the stock of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d). We have elected for two of our subsidiaries to be treated as TRSs. One of our TRSs is subject to federal, state and local income taxes at the applicable corporate rates and the other is subject to foreign income taxes. As of December 31, 2018, one of our TRSs had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $5.8 million. The loss carry-forward is fully reserved as of December 31, 2018 with a valuation allowance due to uncertainties regarding realization.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $0.8 million of state and local income tax provision and approximately $2.2 million of tax provision for foreign income taxes.\nNational Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Funds From Operations\nOur funds from operations ( Nareit FFO\u201d), for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $587.4 million, compared to $444.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nWe calculate and report Nareit FFO in accordance with the definition of Funds from Operations and interpretive guidelines issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( Nareit\u201d), and, consequently, Nareit FFO is defined as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d)), adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization and impairment on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. We believe that Nareit FFO is an important supplemental measure of our operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. Nareit FFO was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue. Nareit FFO herein is not necessarily comparable to Nareit FFO of other REITs that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us.\nNareit FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Nareit FFO as one of several criteria to measure the operating performance of our business. We further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization, impairment on real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, Nareit FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. We offer this measure to assist the users of our financial statements in evaluating our financial performance under GAAP, and Nareit FFO should not be considered a measure of liquidity, an alternative to net income or an indicator of any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including net income.\nThe following table presents our Nareit FFO results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n293,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n104,910\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeduct gain from real estate dispositions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(24,774)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(53,912)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd back loss from real estate dispositions - unconsolidated joint venture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n269,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,998\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nElimination of non-cash items included in net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n281,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n287,591\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation - unconsolidated joint venture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,630\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd back impairments on real estate properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n99,070\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd back impairments on real estate properties - unconsolidated joint venture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNareit FFO (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n587,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n444,289\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Includes amounts allocated to Omega stockholders and Omega OP Unit holders.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $908.4 million, an increase of $7.6 million over the same period in 2016.

One of our TRSs is subject to federal, state and local income taxes at the applicable corporate rates and the other is subject to foreign income taxes. As of December 31, 2017, one of our TRSs had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $5.4 million. The loss carry-forward is fully reserved as of December 31, 2017 with a valuation allowance due to uncertainties regarding realization.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded approximately $2.4 million of state and local income tax provision and approximately $0.8 million of tax provision for foreign income taxes.\nNational Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Funds From Operations\nOur Nareit FFO, for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $444.3 million, compared to $660.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nThe following table presents our Nareit FFO results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n104,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n383,367\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeduct gain from real estate dispositions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(53,912)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(50,208)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n333,159\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nElimination of non-cash items included in net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n287,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n267,062\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation -

In connection with our disposition of the mortgages, we wrote-off approximately $0.6 million of unamortized deferred costs that are recorded in Gain on assets sold - net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These fixed rate mortgages had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.06% per annum and matured in July 2044.\n$500 Million Equity Shelf Program\nOn September 3, 2015, we entered into separate Equity Distribution Agreements (collectively, the Equity Shelf Agreements\u201d) to sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500 million (the 2015 Equity Shelf Program\u201d) with several financial institutions, each as a sales agent and/or principal (collectively, the Managers\u201d). Under the terms of the Equity Shelf Agreements, we may sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through or to the Managers having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500 million. Sales of the shares, if any, are made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at market prices, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable Manager. We pay each Manager compensation for sales of the shares equal to 2% of the gross sales price per share for shares sold through such Manager under the applicable Equity Shelf Agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued approximately 0.7 million shares under the 2015 Equity Shelf Program, at an average price of $29.97 per share, net of issuance costs, generating net proceeds of approximately $19.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we issued approximately 0.7 million shares under the 2015 Equity Shelf Program, at an average price of $30.81 per share, net of issuance costs, generating net proceeds of approximately $22.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued approximately 2.3 million shares under the 2015 Equity Shelf Program, at an average price of $33.18 per share, net of issuance costs, generating net proceeds of approximately $75.5 million.\nDividends\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our REIT taxable income\u201d (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain), and (ii) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum of certain items of non-cash income. In addition, if we dispose of any built-in gain asset during a recognition period, we will be required to distribute at least 90% of the built-in gain (after tax), if any, recognized on the disposition of such asset. Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. In addition, such distributions are required to be made pro rata, with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class, and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our REIT taxable income\u201d as adjusted, we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.\nIn 2018 we paid dividends of $528.7 million to our common stockholders.\nCommon Dividends\nThe Board has declared common stock dividends as set forth below:\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividend per\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecord Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommon Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJanuary 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFebruary 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ 0.66\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nApril 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMay 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.66\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJuly 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAugust 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.66\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOctober 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNovember 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.66\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJanuary 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFebruary 15, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.66\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn the same dates listed above, the Omega OP Unit holders received the same distributions per unit as those paid to the common stockholders of Omega.\nLiquidity\nWe believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital, including cash from operations, our existing availability under our credit facilities, facility sales and expected proceeds from mortgage and other investment payoffs are adequate to finance operations, meet recurring debt service requirements and fund future investments through the next twelve months.\nWe regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flow from operations, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs.

Operating cash flows have historically been determined by: (i) the number of facilities we lease or have mortgages on; (ii) rental and mortgage rates; (iii) our debt service obligations; (iv) general and administrative expenses and (v) our operators' ability to pay amounts owed. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by or used in financing activities and in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, especially to changes in interest rates. Changes in the capital markets environment may impact the availability of cost-effective capital and affect our plans for acquisition and disposition activity.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $11.7 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $85.1 million as compared to the balance at December 31, 2017. The following is a discussion of changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nOperating Activities - Operating activities generated $499.4 million of net cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $577.9 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $78.5 million which is primarily due to the loss of direct financing lease income from Orianna and a $50.0 million payment to one of our operators to acquire a portion of their in-the-money purchase option of which approximately $28.4 million was recorded as a lease inducement.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash flow from investing activities was an outflow of $173.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to an outflow of $285.1 million for the same period in 2017. The $111.9 million change in cash flow from investing activities related primarily to (i) a $280.3 million decrease in real estate acquisitions, (ii) a $51.8 million increase in proceeds from sale of real estate investments, (iii) a $7.9 million decrease in capital improvements to real estate investments and (iv) a $6.0 million increase in receipts from insurance proceeds. Offsetting these changes were: (i) a $161.0 million increase in other investments - net primarily related to funding more other investments in 2018, (ii) a $52.8 million increase in investments in construction in progress in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, (iii) a $12.3 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of direct financing lease assets and (iv) a $6.1 million increase in mortgages - net primarily related to funding additional mortgages in 2018.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash flow from financing activities was an outflow of $410.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to an outflow of $303.8 million for the same period in 2017. The $106.9 million change in cash from financing activities was primarily related to (i) a net $77.0 million decrease in cash proceeds from our credit facility, (ii) a net $96.0 million decrease in cash from our other long-term borrowings, primarily resulting from the second quarter 2017 issuance of $550.0 million 4.75% Senior Notes due 2028 and $150.0 million 4.5% Senior Notes due 2025, offset by the repayment of the $400.0 million 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 and (iii) a $26.1 million increase in dividends paid, offset by (i) a $53.4 million increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, (ii) a $29.2 million decrease in financing related costs in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017 and (iii) a $10.1 million increase in net proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe have identified four significant accounting policies that we believe are critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant assumptions, judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, we believe the application of assumptions, judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The four critical accounting policies are:\nLease Accounting\nAt the inception of the lease and during the amendment process, we evaluate each lease to determine if the lease should be considered an operating lease, sales-type lease, or direct financing lease. As of December 31, 2018, we have determined that all but three of our leases should be accounted for as operating leases. The other three leases are accounted for as direct financing leases.\nFor leases accounted for as operating leases, we retain ownership of the asset and record depreciation expense. We also record lease revenue based on the contractual terms of the operating lease agreement which often includes annual rent escalators, see Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\u201d below for further discussion regarding the recordation of revenue on our operating leases.\nFor leases accounted for as direct financing leases, we record the present value of the future minimum lease payments (utilizing a constant interest rate over the term of the lease agreement) as a receivable and record interest income based on the contractual terms of the lease agreement. Certain direct financing leases include annual rent escalators; see Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\u201d below for further discussion regarding the recording of interest income on our direct financing leases. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have no unamortized direct costs related to originating our direct financing leases recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe have various different investments that generate revenue, including leased and mortgaged properties, as well as other investments, which include secured and unsecured loans. We recognize rental income and other investment income as earned over the terms of the related leases and notes, respectively. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected using the effective interest method. In applying the effective interest method, the effective yield on a loan is determined based on its contractual payment terms, adjusted for prepayment terms.\nSubstantially all of our operating leases contain provisions for specified annual increases over the rents of the prior year and are generally computed in one of three methods depending on specific provisions of each lease as follows: (i) a specific annual increase over the prior year's rent, generally between 2.0% and 3.0%; (ii) an increase based on the change in pre-determined formulas from year to year (e.g. increases in the Consumer Price Index); or (iii) specific dollar increases over prior years. Revenue under lease arrangements with minimum fixed and determinable increases is recognized over the non-cancellable term of the lease on a straight-line basis. The authoritative guidance does not provide for the recognition of contingent revenue until all possible contingencies have been eliminated. We consider the operating history of the lessee, the payment history, the general condition of the industry and various other factors when evaluating whether all possible contingencies have been eliminated.\nIn the case of rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis, we generally record reserves against earned revenues from leases when collection becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators result in significant uncertainty regarding ultimate collection. The amount of the reserve is estimated based on what management believes will likely be collected. We continually evaluate the collectability of our straight-line rent assets. If it appears that we will not collect future rent due under our leases, we will record a provision for loss related to the straight-line rent asset.\nWe record direct financing lease income on a constant interest rate basis over the term of the lease. Costs related to originating the direct financing leases are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to income from direct financing leases over the term of the direct financing leases. Allowances are provided against earned revenues from direct financing leases when collection of amounts due becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators lead to lower expectations regarding ultimate collection.\nMortgage interest income and other investment income is recognized as earned over the terms of the related mortgage notes or other investment, typically using the effective yield method. Allowances are provided against earned revenues from mortgage interest or other investment income when collection of amounts due becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators lead to lower expectations regarding ultimate collection.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09 and its subsequent updates using a modified retrospective approach. As a result of adopting ASU 2014-09, we recognize any gains when we transfer control of a property and when it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the related consideration. As a result of adopting ASU 2014-09 and its updates on January 1, 2018, the Company recognized $10.0 million of deferred gain resulting from the sale of facilities to a third-party in December 2017 through opening equity on January 1, 2018.\nWe review our accounts receivable to determine their collectability. The determination of collectability of these assets requires significant judgment and is affected by several factors relating to the credit quality of our operators that we regularly monitor, including (i) payment history, (ii) the age of the contractual receivables, (iii) the current economic conditions and reimbursement environment, (iv) the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease and/or contractual loan agreements and (v) the value of the underlying collateral of the agreement. If we determine collectability of any of our contractual receivables is at risk, we estimate the potential uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance. In the case of a lease recognized on a straight-line basis, a mortgage recognized on an effective yield basis or the existence of lease inducements, we generally provide an allowance for straight-line, effective interest, and or lease inducement accounts receivable when certain conditions or indicators of adverse collectability are present. If the accounts receivable balance is subsequently deemed uncollectible, the receivable and allowance for doubtful account balance are written off.\nDepreciation and Real Estate Investment Impairment\nUnder GAAP, real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value, if deemed impaired. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 40 years for buildings, eight to 15 years for site improvements, and three to ten years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold interests are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or term of the lease.\nManagement evaluates our real estate investments for impairment indicators at each reporting period, including the evaluation of our assets' useful lives. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as, but not limited to, market conditions, operator performance including the current payment status of contractual obligations and expectations of the ability to meet future contractual obligations, legal structure, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. If indicators of impairment are present, management evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to management's estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are generally based on the related lease which relates to one or more properties and may include cash flows from the eventual disposition of the asset. In some instances, there may be various potential outcomes for a real estate investment and its potential future cash flows. In these instances, the undiscounted future cash flows used to assess the recoverability are probability-weighted based on management's best estimates as of the date of evaluation. Provisions for impairment losses related to long-lived assets are recognized when expected future undiscounted cash flows based on our intended use of the property are determined to be less than the carrying values of the assets. An adjustment is made to the net carrying value of the real estate investments for the excess of carrying value over fair value. The fair value of the real estate investment is determined based on current market conditions and considers matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties, recent sales data for comparable properties, and, where applicable, contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers. Additionally, our evaluation of fair value may consider valuing the property as a nursing home as well as alternative uses. All impairments are taken as a period cost at that time, and depreciation is adjusted going forward to reflect the new value assigned to the asset. Management's impairment evaluation process, and when applicable, impairment calculations involve estimation of the future cash flows from management's intended use of the property as well as the fair value of the property. Changes in the facts and circumstances that drive management's assumptions may result in an impairment to our assets in a future period that could be material to our results of operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized impairment losses on real estate investments of $29.8 million, $99.1 million and $58.7 million, respectively.\nAllowance for Losses on Mortgages, Other Investments and Direct Financing Leases\nThe allowances for losses on mortgage notes receivable, other investments and direct financing leases (collectively, our loans\u201d) are maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses. The determination of the allowances is based on a quarterly evaluation of these loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We evaluate the collectability of our loans based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors, if applicable, and the value of the underlying collateral. If such factors indicate that there is greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements. Consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual status may be deemed impaired. To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we will return these loans to full accrual status. When management identifies potential loan impairment indicators, the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future cash flows. In cases where expected future cash flows are not readily determinable, the loan is written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral, if applicable. We may base our valuation on a loan's observable market price, if any, or the fair value of collateral, net of sales costs, if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the collateral.\nWe currently account for impaired loans using (a) the cost-recovery method, and/or (b) the cash basis method. We generally utilize the cost-recovery method for impaired loans for which impairment reserves were recorded. We utilize the cash basis method for impaired loans for which no impairment reserves were recorded because the net present value of the discounted cash flows expected under the loan and/or the underlying collateral supporting the loan were equal to or exceeded the book value of the loan. Under the cost-recovery method, we apply cash received against the outstanding loan balance prior to recording interest income. Under the cash basis method, we apply cash received to principal or interest income based on the terms of the agreement. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $108.1 million and $177.5 million, respectively, of reserves on our loans.", "item_7_truncated": " \u00b7 Our depreciation and amortization expense was $287.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $267.1 million for the same period in 2016. The increase of $20.5 million was primarily due to the acquisitions and the placement of assets in service during 2016 and 2017. \nTable 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(xii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe amount and yield of any additional investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09 and its subsequent updates using a modified retrospective approach.

we received $78.8 million from the Trust as a partial liquidation of the Trust. We will receive other payments from the Trust when the accounts receivable are collected and as the estimated creditor claims and costs to wind down the Trust are finalized.\nWe believe that our operating results display the strength of our conservative balance sheet and operating model against the backdrop of a dynamic operating environment. We believe our operators will generally benefit from the October 2019 change in the Medicare prospective payment system from RUG-IV (driven by therapy volume) to the PDPM (driven by patient disease conditions), as well as from the projected growth in elderly demographics in the years to come. Increasing labor and liability costs, evolving reimbursement models, and localized occupancy trends may put near term financial strain on some operators within the skilled nursing industry, particularly in states with unfavorable Medicaid reimbursement rates.\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInitial\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAnnual\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNumber of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBuilding & Site\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFurniture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCash\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFacilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInvestment (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nImprovements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n& Fixtures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSNF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nALF/ILF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nState\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQ1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.50\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQ2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.50\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQ2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUK\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n124.2\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n85.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.50\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQ3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.25\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQ3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n211.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n180.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.50\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQ3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.0\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.60\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQ4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.25\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n412.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n56.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n331.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (4) All of the aforementioned acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. \n (vi) changes in our credit ratings and the ratings of our debt securities; \nThe Company has one reportable segment consisting of investments in healthcare-related real estate properties located in the United States ( U.S.\u201d) and the United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d). Our core business is to provide financing and capital to the long-term healthcare industry with a particular focus on skilled nursing facilities ( SNFs\u201d), and, to a lesser extent, assisted living facilities ( ALFs\u201d), independent living facilities ( ILFs\u201d) and rehabilitation and acute care facilities. Our core portfolio consists of long-term leases and mortgage agreements. All of our leases are triple-net\u201d leases, which require the operators (we use the term operator\u201d to refer to our tenants and mortgagors and their affiliates who manage and/or operate our properties) to pay all property-related expenses. Our mortgage revenue derives from fixed rate mortgage loans, which are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

We recognize rental income and other investment income as earned over the terms of the related leases and notes, respectively. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected using the effective interest method. In applying the effective interest method, the effective yield on a loan is determined based on its contractual payment terms, adjusted for prepayment terms.\n \u00b7 Other investment income totaled $40.2 million, an increase of $11.0 million over the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily related to the issuance of new notes and additional funding to existing operators. \nThe allowances for losses on mortgage notes receivable, other investments and direct financing leases (collectively, our loans\u201d) are maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses. The determination of the allowances is based on a quarterly evaluation of these loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We evaluate the collectability of our loans based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors, if applicable, and the value of the underlying collateral. If such factors indicate that there is greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements. Consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual status may be deemed impaired. To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we will return these loans to full accrual status. When management identifies potential loan impairment indicators, the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future cash flows. In cases where expected future cash flows are not readily determinable, the loan is written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral, if applicable. We may base our valuation on a loan's observable market price, if any, or the fair value of collateral, net of sales costs, if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the collateral.\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n104,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n383,367\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeduct gain from real estate dispositions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(53,912)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(50,208)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n333,159\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nElimination of non-cash items included in net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n287,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n267,062\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation - unconsolidated joint venture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,107\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd back impairments on real estate properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n99,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,726\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNareit FFO (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n444,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n660,054\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $58.7 million on 29 facilities.\nOn January 2, 2019, Omega and Omega OP entered into the Merger Agreement with MedEquities and its subsidiary operating partnership and the general partner of its subsidiary operating partnership. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Omega will acquire MedEquities and MedEquities will be merged with and into Omega (the Merger\u201d) at the effective time of the Merger with Omega continuing as the surviving company. At the effective time, each outstanding share of MedEquities common stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.235 of a share of Omega common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) $2.00 in cash, without interest, subject to adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement under certain limited circumstances. As of December 31, 2018, the total consideration expected to be exchanged in the merger, including the assumption of debt is approximately $600 million. The Merger Agreement also provides that MedEquities will declare a special dividend of $0.21 per share of MedEquities common stock payable to the holders of record of MedEquities common stock as of the trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger, which dividend will be payable following the effective time of the Merger together with the cash consideration under the Merger Agreement.\n \u00b7 Our impairment on direct financing leases was approximately $27.2 million, compared to $198.2 million for the same period in 2017. In 2017, we recorded $198.2 million of impairment loss on direct financing leases primarily resulting from (a) terminating Orianna's Texas region lease, (b) selling Orianna's Northwest region facilities and (c) the impairment of Orianna's Southeast region lease. In 2018, we recorded an additional $27.2 million impairment loss on the remaining 15 facilities in Orianna's Southeast region lease. \n2018 Taxes\nOperating Expenses\nThe following tables summarize the significant transactions that occurred between 2016 and 2018.\nNational Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Funds From Operations\n \u00b7 Rental income was $775.2 million, an increase of $31.3 million over the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily the result of facility acquisitions in the U.S. and the U.K. in 2016 and 2017 and lease amendments made throughout 2016 and 2017. These increases were offset by the loss of rental income from facility sales and placing one operator on a cash basis in 2017. \nAllowance for Losses on Mortgages, Other Investments and Direct Financing Leases\n \u00b7 $44.2 million first mortgage loan with an existing operator of ours. The loan is secured by five SNFs with 522 beds located in Michigan. The loan is cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with our existing loans and master lease with the operator. The loan bears an initial annual interest rate of 9.5%, which rate increases each year by 0.225%. \n\n \u00b7 Acquisition costs decreased by $9.6 million. The $9.6 million decrease was primarily due to the capitalization of acquisition costs in 2017. \nAs of December 31, 2018, we have completed substantially all of our strategic asset repositions and portfolio restructuring. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold 14 facilities (nine previously held for sale at September 30, 2018) subject to operating leases for approximately $63.2 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $15.5 million.\nOur operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $908.4 million, an increase of $7.6 million over the same period in 2016. Following is a description of certain of the changes in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016:\nOther Income (Expense)\nOur portfolio of investments at December 31, 2018, included 924 healthcare facilities, located in 41 states and the U.K. that are operated by 68 third-party operators. Our real estate investment in these facilities totaled approximately $8.6 billion at December 31, 2018, with 99% of our real estate investments related to long-term healthcare facilities. The portfolio is made up of (i) 735 SNFs, (ii) 116 ALFs, (iii) 14 specialty facilities, (iv) one medical office building, (v) fixed rate mortgages on 51 SNFs and three ALFs and (vi) four SNFs that are currently closed or held for sale. At December 31, 2018, we held other investments of approximately $504.6 million, consisting primarily of secured loans to third-party operators of our facilities and a $31.0 million investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.\nDuring 2018, we acquired two parcels of land (not reflected in the table above) for approximately $3.5 million with the intent of building new facilities for our existing operators.\n (3) In July 2017, we transitioned nine SNFs formerly subject to a direct financing lease to another operator. As a result of terminating the direct financing lease, we wrote down the facilities to our original cost basis and recorded an impairment on the direct financing lease of approximately $1.8 million. \n\nGain on Assets Sold\n (1) We recorded a non-cash deferred tax liability and acquisition costs of approximately $8.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in connection with this acquisition. \n \u00b7 Our depreciation and amortization expense was $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $287.6 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease of $6.3 million was primarily due to the timing of dispositions, impairments and normal decreases due to short lived assets becoming fully depreciated, offset by acquisitions and the placement of assets in service during 2017 and 2018. \n (xv) our ability to maintain our status as a REIT. \nAt December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $8.6 billion, total equity of $3.8 billion and debt of $4.6 billion, with such debt representing approximately 54.9% of total capitalization.\nAsset Sales\n (2) The cash yield is based on the purchase price. \nWe currently account for impaired loans using (a) the cost-recovery method, and/or (b) the cash basis method. We generally utilize the cost-recovery method for impaired loans for which impairment reserves were recorded. We utilize the cash basis method for impaired loans for which no impairment reserves were recorded because the net present value of the discounted cash flows expected under the loan and/or the underlying collateral supporting the loan were equal to or exceeded the book value of the loan. Under the cost-recovery method, we apply cash received against the outstanding loan balance prior to recording interest income. Under the cash basis method, we apply cash received to principal or interest income based on the terms of the agreement. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $108.1 million and $177.5 million, respectively, of reserves on our loans.\nAcquisition and Other Investments\n \u00b7 Our provision for uncollectible accounts was $6.7 million, compared to $14.6 million for the same period in 2017. The 2018 provision was primarily related to $11.5 million of reserves for straight line accounts receivable and contractual receivables resulting from facility transitions and placing an operator on a cash basis due to their non-payment of rent. Our provision was offset by a recovery of approximately $4.8 million from Orianna based on cash received pursuant to the RSA. The 2017 provision was primarily related to a $9.5 million reserve of contractual and straight line accounts receivable for Orianna and approximately $5.1 million related to other facilities that we have transitioned or sold. \nFor leases accounted for as operating leases, we retain ownership of the asset and record depreciation expense. We also record lease revenue based on the contractual terms of the operating lease agreement which often includes annual rent escalators, see Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\u201d below for further discussion regarding the recordation of revenue on our operating leases.\nAs part of the restructuring, Signature Healthcare entered into new working capital credit facilities with its new working capital lender for each of its separate silos, including Agemo. In addition, as part of our restructure, certain third-party guarantors of the Agemo master lease were required to contribute approximately $7.8 million in funds to the enterprise to be used to reduce the outstanding contractual receivables owed to us from Agemo. On May 8, 2018, we received $5.0 million in cash from the guarantors and a one-year term note from the principals of Agemo for approximately $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2018, Agemo is paying rent and interest pursuant to our lease and loan agreements.\nOperating Revenues\n (4) All of the aforementioned acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOn September 3, 2015, we entered into separate Equity Distribution Agreements (collectively, the Equity Shelf Agreements\u201d) to sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500 million (the 2015 Equity Shelf Program\u201d) with several financial institutions, each as a sales agent and/or principal (collectively, the Managers\u201d). Under the terms of the Equity Shelf Agreements, we may sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through or to the Managers having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500 million. Sales of the shares, if any, are made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at market prices, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable Manager. We pay each Manager compensation for sales of the shares equal to 2% of the gross sales price per share for shares sold through such Manager under the applicable Equity Shelf Agreements.\nItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n (1) The $4.6 billion of debt outstanding includes: (i) $313.0 million in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility due in May 2021, (ii) $128.0 million under the \u00a3100 million British Pound Sterling term loan facility due May 2022, (iii) $100 million under the Omega OP Term Loan Facility due May 2022, (iv) $250 million under the 2015 Term Loan Facility due December 2022, (v) $425 million under the U.S. Term Loan Facility due May 2022, (vi) $400 million of 4.50% Senior Notes due January 2025, (vii) $400 million of 4.95% Senior Notes due April 2024, (viii) $550 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due January 2028, (ix) $600 million of 5.25% Senior Notes due January 2026, (x) $700 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due August 2023, (xi) $700 million of 4.5% Senior Notes due April 2027 and (xii) $20 million of 9.0% per annum subordinated debt maturing in December 2021. Other than the $100 million outstanding under the Omega OP Term Loan Facility, the Parent is the obligor of all outstanding debt. \nDividends\n (xiv) the potential impact of changes in the SNF and ALF markets or local real estate conditions on our ability to dispose of assets held for sale for the anticipated proceeds or on a timely basis, or to redeploy the proceeds therefrom on favorable terms; and \n (iv) our ability to re-lease, otherwise transition, or sell underperforming assets or assets held for sale on a timely basis and on terms that allow us to realize the carrying value of these assets; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $24.8 million of net gain on assets sold, as compared to $53.9 million for the same period in 2017. During 2018 and 2017, we sold 78 facilities and 52 facilities, respectively, as we continue to exit certain facilities, operator relationships and/or states to improve the strength of our overall portfolio.\nIn 2017, we sold eight facilities subject to direct financing leases with Orianna in the Northwest region and the Southeast region of the U.S. with a carrying value of approximately $36.4 million for approximately $33.3 million to unrelated third parties. We recorded approximately $3.3 million of impairment related to these sales. In addition, we transitioned nine SNFs, representing all of the facilities subject to another direct financing lease with Orianna in the Texas region, to an existing operator of ours pursuant to an operating lease. In connection with this transaction, we recorded the real estate properties at our original cost basis of approximately $19.0 million, eliminated our investment in the Texas region direct financing lease and recorded an impairment of approximately $1.8 million. In conjunction with this transaction, we also amended our Orianna Southeast region master lease to reduce the outstanding balance by $19.3 million. As a result of the lease amendment in 2017, we recorded impairment on our investment in direct financing lease of approximately $20.8 million in 2017.\nDuring 2018, we transitioned 21 SNFs and one ALF subject to direct financing leases (not reflected in the table above) with a net carrying value of approximately $184.5 million from an existing operator to five other existing operators subject to single or master operating leases with an initial annual cash yield of approximately 9%. We recorded approximately $184.5 million of real estate investments consisting of land ($11.2 million), building and site improvements ($159.1 million) and furniture and fixtures ($14.2 million) in partial satisfaction of the direct financing lease. In connection with these transitions, we provided the new operators with working capital loans with a maximum borrowing capacity of $45.7 million, commitments to fund capital improvements up to $10.6 million and indemnities with a maximum funding of $7.4 million. Claims against these indemnities must occur within 18 months to 36 months of the transition date. These indemnities were provided to the new operators upon transition and would be utilized in the event that the prior operator does not perform under their transition agreements. We do not expect to fund a material amount under these indemnity agreements.\nForward-Looking Statements, Reimbursement Issues and Other Factors Affecting Future Results\n \u00b7 extend a 7-year working capital term loan at 7% for an amount up to $25 million with a maturity date of April 30, 2025 ($14.3 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2018); \nAs of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $33.8 million of contractual receivables outstanding - net of allowances. Of the $33.8 million of contractual receivables outstanding - net of allowances, approximately $18.3 million relates to Agemo Holdings LLC ( Agemo\u201d an entity formed in May 2018 to silo the leases and loans formerly held by Signature Healthcare) and Daybreak Venture LLC ( Daybreak\u201d). Daybreak is on a cash basis of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition, see additional discussion below. In addition to the contractual receivables, we have approximately $43.5 million of straight-line rent receivables and/or lease inducements associated with these operators as of December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded approximately $83.2 million and $82.6 million, of rental income, respectively, and $3.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of other investment income from these operators. Additionally, $5.4 million of the $33.8 million of contractual receivables outstanding - net of allowances as of December 31, 2018, relates to one operator that continues to pay, although at times less than the monthly contractual rent due. We continue to monitor this operator, including their contractual payments and their operational performance to determine if it will impact our revenue recognition in future periods.\nAgreement to acquire MedEquities\n2017 Taxes\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we recorded an allowance for loss on direct financing leases of $172.2 million with Orianna covering 38 facilities in the Southeast region of the U.S. The amount of the allowance was determined based on the fair value of the facilities subject to the direct financing lease. To estimate the fair value of the underlying collateral, we utilized an income approach and Level 3 inputs. Our estimate of fair value assumed annual rents ranging between $32.0 million and $38.0 million, rental yields between 9% and 10%, current and projected operating performance of the facilities, coverage ratios and bed values. Our recorded investment in these direct financing leases, net of the $172.2 million of allowances, amounted to $337.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nIn 2016, we sold 38 facilities (three previously held for sale at December 31, 2015) subject to operating leases for approximately $169.6 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $50.2 million.\n\nDuring 2017, we acquired three parcels of land (not reflected in the table above) for approximately $6.7 million with the intent of building new facilities for existing operators.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we placed Daybreak on a cash basis for revenue recognition as a result of nonpayment. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we executed a Settlement and Forbearance Agreement with Daybreak which permitted Daybreak to defer payments of up to 23% of their contractual rent for the remainder of 2017, subject to certain conditions. Daybreak was in compliance with the agreement at September 30, 2018; however, during the fourth quarter of 2018, Daybreak fell behind on rent by approximately two months and accordingly was not in compliance with the 2017 Settlement and Forbearance Agreement as a result of not paying the full contractual amounts due.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold 32 facilities (two previously held for sale at September 30, 2017) subject to operating leases for approximately $188.0 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $46.4 million.\n (1) Our investment includes a purchase option buyout obligation with a fair value of approximately $29.6 million. We also acquired a term loan with a fair value of approximately $37.0 million which is recorded in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In August 2017, the purchase option buyout obligation was terminated and the operator used the proceeds to repay certain other investments. \nIn 2018, we sold 78 facilities (22 previously held for sale at December 31, 2017) subject to operating leases for approximately $309.6 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $24.8 million.\n\n (iii) the ability of any of our operators in bankruptcy to reject unexpired lease obligations, modify the terms of our mortgages and impede our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding and retain security deposits for the debtor's obligations, and other costs and uncertainties associated with operator bankruptcies; \n \u00b7 $35.1 million of new investments with an existing operator. The investment included acquisitions of three SNFs and one ILF from an unrelated third party. The four Pennsylvania facilities with 420 beds were added to an existing operator's master lease with an initial cash yield of 9.5% with 2.5% annual rent escalators. \nOur 2018, 2017 and 2016 recorded impairments were primarily the result of decisions to exit certain non-strategic facilities and/or operators. We reduced the net book value of the impaired facilities to their estimated fair values or, with respect to the facilities reclassified to assets held for sale, to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. To estimate the fair value of the facilities, we utilized a market approach which considered binding sale agreements (a Level 1 input) and/or Level 3 inputs which generally consist of non-binding offers from unrelated third parties.\nFinancing Activities and Borrowing Arrangements\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $99.1 million on 37 facilities including approximately $2.6 million of capitalized costs associated with the termination of construction projects with two of our operators. The total net recorded investment in these properties after impairments and excluding facilities previously sold was approximately $125.1 million as of December 31, 2017, with approximately $7.7 million related to properties classified as held for sale.\nOrianna\nLease Accounting\n \u00b7 Direct financing lease income was $1.6 million, a decrease of $30.7 million over the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily related to placing Orianna on a cash basis effective July 1, 2017 due to Orianna's non-payment of rent and the sale of a direct financing lease facility. \nOn July 23, 2018, we notified Orianna that it was in default under the DIP credit agreement. On July 25, 2018, Omega terminated the RSA with its tenant, 4 West Holdings, and the sponsor of Orianna's Plan.\n \u00b7 normal recurring expenses; \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $3.2 million on three facilities (two were subsequently reclassified to held for sale).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $35.0 million on 35 facilities. Our impairments were offset by $5.2 million of insurance proceeds received related to a facility destroyed in November 2017. The total net recorded investment in these properties after impairments and excluding facilities previously sold was approximately $14.8 million as of December 31, 2018, with approximately $1.0 million related to properties classified as held for sale.\nOperating Activities - Operating activities generated $499.4 million of net cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $577.9 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $78.5 million which is primarily due to the loss of direct financing lease income from Orianna and a $50.0 million payment to one of our operators to acquire a portion of their in-the-money purchase option of which approximately $28.4 million was recorded as a lease inducement.\nIn 2018, we completed the following transactions totaling approximately $471 million in new investments:\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this document, including statements regarding potential future changes in reimbursement. This document contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including all statements regarding future financial position and financial metrics, expected synergies and benefits, dividends and dividend plans, financing plans, and other expectations and beliefs regarding future events. These statements relate to our expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, performance and underlying assumptions and other statements other than statements of historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including, but not limited to, terms such as anticipate,\u201d if,\u201d may,\u201d plan,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d would,\u201d will,\u201d anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d believes,\u201d intends,\u201d should\u201d seeks,\u201d approximately,\u201d outlook,\u201d looking forward\u201d or comparable terms or the negative thereof. These statements are based on information available on the date of this filing and only speak as to the date hereof and no obligation to update such forward-looking statements should be assumed. Our actual results may differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things:\nThe following table presents our Nareit FFO results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded approximately $2.4 million of state and local income tax provision and approximately $0.8 million of tax provision for foreign income taxes.\nAt the inception of the lease and during the amendment process, we evaluate each lease to determine if the lease should be considered an operating lease, sales-type lease, or direct financing lease. As of December 31, 2018, we have determined that all but three of our leases should be accounted for as operating leases. The other three leases are accounted for as direct financing leases.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash flow from financing activities was an outflow of $410.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to an outflow of $303.8 million for the same period in 2017. The $106.9 million change in cash from financing activities was primarily related to (i) a net $77.0 million decrease in cash proceeds from our credit facility, (ii) a net $96.0 million decrease in cash from our other long-term borrowings, primarily resulting from the second quarter 2017 issuance of $550.0 million 4.75% Senior Notes due 2028 and $150.0 million 4.5% Senior Notes due 2025, offset by the repayment of the $400.0 million 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 and (iii) a $26.1 million increase in dividends paid, offset by (i) a $53.4 million increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, (ii) a $29.2 million decrease in financing related costs in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017 and (iii) a $10.1 million increase in net proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017.\nDuring 2016, we acquired five parcels of land (not reflected in the table above) for approximately $8.3 million with the intent of building new facilities for existing operators.\nMortgage interest income and other investment income is recognized as earned over the terms of the related mortgage notes or other investment, typically using the effective yield method. Allowances are provided against earned revenues from mortgage interest or other investment income when collection of amounts due becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators lead to lower expectations regarding ultimate collection.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that Orianna's Plan, if confirmed, would allow Orianna to use the value of Orianna's remaining facilities to pay the administrative costs of Orianna's Chapter 11 cases and to pay certain other creditor claims, with the net amount of such value being paid to us. As a result, we recorded $27.2 million in additional allowance for loss to reduce the remaining investment in the direct financing lease covering the remaining 15 facilities located in the Southeast region of the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, our net investment in the Orianna direct financing lease is approximately $120.5 million, net of an allowance of $103.2 million.\nWe have identified four significant accounting policies that we believe are critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant assumptions, judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, we believe the application of assumptions, judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The four critical accounting policies are:\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the performance of all of our operators, as well as industry trends and developments generally.\nGain on Assets Sold\nWe believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital, including cash from operations, our existing availability under our credit facilities, facility sales and expected proceeds from mortgage and other investment payoffs are adequate to finance operations, meet recurring debt service requirements and fund future investments through the next twelve months.\nIn 2018 we paid dividends of $528.7 million to our common stockholders.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our REIT taxable income\u201d (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain), and (ii) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum of certain items of non-cash income. In addition, if we dispose of any built-in gain asset during a recognition period, we will be required to distribute at least 90% of the built-in gain (after tax), if any, recognized on the disposition of such asset. Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. In addition, such distributions are required to be made pro rata, with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class, and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our REIT taxable income\u201d as adjusted, we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.\nBecause we qualify as a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income taxes on the REIT taxable income that we distribute to stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. For tax year 2018, we made common dividend payments of $528.7 million to satisfy REIT requirements relating to qualifying income. Subject to the limitation under the REIT asset test rules, we are permitted to own up to 100% of the stock of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d). We have elected for two of our subsidiaries to be treated as TRSs. One of our TRSs is subject to federal, state and local income taxes at the applicable corporate rates and the other is subject to foreign income taxes. As of December 31, 2018, one of our TRSs had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $5.8 million. The loss carry-forward is fully reserved as of December 31, 2018 with a valuation allowance due to uncertainties regarding realization.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $408.9 million, a decrease of approximately $238.3 million over the same period in 2017. Following is a description of certain of the changes in our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017:\nOf the 78 facilities sold during 2018, we sold 12 SNFs on June 1, 2018 secured by HUD mortgages to subsidiaries of an existing operator. The Company sold the 12 SNF facilities with carrying values of approximately $62 million for approximately $78 million which consisted of $25 million of cash consideration and their assumption of approximately $53 million of our HUD mortgages. Simultaneously, subsidiaries of the operator assumed our HUD restricted cash accounts, deposits and escrows. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $11 million after approximately $5 million of closing and other transaction related costs. In connection with this sale, we provided a principal of an existing operator an unsecured loan of approximately $39.7 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations. Operating cash flows have historically been determined by: (i) the number of facilities we lease or have mortgages on; (ii) rental and mortgage rates; (iii) our debt service obligations; (iv) general and administrative expenses and (v) our operators' ability to pay amounts owed. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by or used in financing activities and in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, especially to changes in interest rates. Changes in the capital markets environment may impact the availability of cost-effective capital and affect our plans for acquisition and disposition activity.\n \u00b7 In 2017, we recorded $99.1 million of impairments on real estate properties, compared to $58.7 million for the same period in 2016. The 2017 impairments primarily related to 37 facilities to reduce their net book value to their estimated fair value less costs to sell or fair value. In 2016, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $58.7 million on 29 facilities. The 2017 and 2016 impairments were primarily the result of decisions to exit certain non-strategic facilities and/or operators. \n\nCommon Dividends\n \u00b7 extend the maturity date of the existing term loan by two years to December 31, 2024. \nNational Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Funds From Operations\nUnder GAAP, real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value, if deemed impaired. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 40 years for buildings, eight to 15 years for site improvements, and three to ten years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold interests are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or term of the lease.\nAgemo\n \u00b7 growth through acquisitions of additional properties. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents our Nareit FFO results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n (x) the effect of economic and market conditions generally and, particularly, in the healthcare industry; \n \u00b7 Our provision for uncollectible accounts was $14.6 million for 2017, compared to $9.8 million for the same period in 2016. The 2017 provision was primarily related to a $9.5 million reserve of contractual and straight line accounts receivable for Orianna and approximately $5.1 million related to other facilities that we intend to transition or sell. In 2016, we recorded a $5.6 million provision on three loans reducing their book value to the fair value of the underlying collateral. In addition, in 2016 we entered into agreements to transition 28 facilities from one of our former operators to a new existing operator. As a result of the transition, we wrote off approximately $3.4 million of straight line receivable from the former operator. \n \u00b7 Other investment income totaled $29.2 million, an increase of $7.4 million over the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily related to the issuance of new notes and additional funding to existing operators. \n (v) the availability and cost of capital to us; \n \u00b7 defer up to $6.3 million of rent per annum for 3 years commencing May 1, 2018; \nOther\nWe regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flow from operations, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized rental revenue of approximately $58.1 million and expensed approximately $9.6 million of acquisition related costs in connection with the aforementioned acquisitions. No goodwill was recorded in connection with these acquisitions.\nOf the 52 facilities sold in 2017, the sale of ten of these facilities did not initially qualify for sale accounting under the full accrual method. The ten SNFs with a carrying value of approximately $23.2 million were sold to a third-party for approximately $43.3 million, resulting in a total gain of approximately $17.5 million after $2.6 million of closing costs. In connection with this sale, we provided the buyer a $10.0 million loan which was recorded in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized a net gain of approximately $7.5 million in 2017 and deferred $10.0 million of gain related to this sale. Upon our adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) on January 1, 2018, we recognized $10.0 million of deferred gain related to this sale through opening equity on January 1, 2018.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $647.1 million, an increase of approximately $256.0 million over the same period in 2016. Following is a description of certain of the changes in our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016:\nBecause we qualify as a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income taxes on the REIT taxable income that we distribute to stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. For tax year 2017, we made common dividend payments of $502.6 million to satisfy REIT requirements relating to qualifying income. Subject to the limitation under the REIT asset test rules, we are permitted to own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. We have elected for two of our subsidiaries to be treated as TRSs. One of our TRSs is subject to federal, state and local income taxes at the applicable corporate rates and the other is subject to foreign income taxes. As of December 31, 2017, one of our TRSs had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $5.4 million. The loss carry-forward is fully reserved as of December 31, 2017 with a valuation allowance due to uncertainties regarding realization.\nHUD Mortgage Disposition\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 $131.3 million secured term loan with an unrelated third party. The loan is secured by a collateral assignment of mortgages covering seven SNFs, three ILFs and one ALF located in Pennsylvania and Virginia. The loan bears an interest rate of 9.35%. On or before its maturity in 2019, we expect to obtain fee simple title to the facilities and add the facilities to an existing operator's master lease. \nIn 2017, we sold 52 facilities (14 previously held for sale at December 31, 2016) subject to operating leases for approximately $257.8 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $53.9 million.\nIn addition to our direct financing leases with Orianna Health Systems ( Orianna\u201d), we own three facilities and had leased them to Orianna under a master lease which was to expire in 2026. The remaining three facility lease is accounted for as an operating lease. Our recorded investment in the three facilities subject to this operating lease was $30.5 million as of December 31, 2018. On October 31, 2018, Orianna rejected the operating lease and as a result we transitioned the remaining three facilities to an existing operator during the first quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we also have a revolving working capital loan issued to Orianna with a balance outstanding as of December 31, 2018 of $15.2 million.\nThe following is our discussion of the consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity and capital resources, which should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized impairment losses on real estate investments of $29.8 million, $99.1 million and $58.7 million, respectively.\n \u00b7 capital improvement programs; \n (6) All of the aforementioned acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. \n \u00b7 $180.9 million of investments in our capital expenditure programs. \nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts Receivable\nFor leases accounted for as direct financing leases, we record the present value of the future minimum lease payments (utilizing a constant interest rate over the term of the lease agreement) as a receivable and record interest income based on the contractual terms of the lease agreement. Certain direct financing leases include annual rent escalators; see Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\u201d below for further discussion regarding the recording of interest income on our direct financing leases. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have no unamortized direct costs related to originating our direct financing leases recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn June 1, 2018, subsidiaries of an existing operator assumed approximately $53 million of our indebtedness guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d) that secured 12 separate facilities located in Arkansas. In connection with our disposition of the mortgages we wrote-off approximately $0.6 million of unamortized deferred costs that are recorded in Gain on assets sold - net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These fixed rate mortgages had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.06% per annum and matured in July 2044.\nOur operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, were $881.7 million, a decrease of $26.7 million over the same period in 2017. Following is a description of certain of the changes in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017:\n(a)Includes amounts allocated to Omega stockholders and Omega OP Unit holders.\nAlthough industry occupancy levels have declined in recent years, the occupancy levels of our facilities and our operator coverages remained stable overall for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018. Our operators continue to experience increased labor costs which we believe is manageable. In addition, our operators continue to see declines in their overall quality mix (Medicare and private pay) as a percentage of operator revenue, which has been driven principally by managed care pressure on lengths of stay and rates. Texas, which represents 10% of our investments as of December 31, 2018, presents a difficult operating environment for SNF operators as a result of lower statewide occupancy levels and a Medicaid rate reimbursement that we believe is among the lowest in the United States. A number of our operators have experienced lower operating margins on their SNFs in Texas as a result of the foregoing and labor costs. The acquisition of MedEquities will increase the percentage of our investments in Texas. We believe the long-term outlook in Texas is positive with favorable demographics, limited new supply, the implementation of the PDPM, and the possibility of Medicaid rate relief.\n2017 Acquisitions and Other\n \u00b7 Mortgage interest income totaled $70.3 million, an increase of $4.1 million over the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to incremental interest income from additional mortgage funding to our operators, offset by mortgage payoffs. \nInvesting Activities - Net cash flow from investing activities was an outflow of $173.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to an outflow of $285.1 million for the same period in 2017. The $111.9 million change in cash flow from investing activities related primarily to (i) a $280.3 million decrease in real estate acquisitions, (ii) a $51.8 million increase in proceeds from sale of real estate investments, (iii) a $7.9 million decrease in capital improvements to real estate investments and (iv) a $6.0 million increase in receipts from insurance proceeds. Offsetting these changes were: (i) a $161.0 million increase in other investments - net primarily related to funding more other investments in 2018, (ii) a $52.8 million increase in investments in construction in progress in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, (iii) a $12.3 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of direct financing lease assets and (iv) a $6.1 million increase in mortgages - net primarily related to funding additional mortgages in 2018.\nOn June 1, 2018, subsidiaries of an existing operator assumed approximately $53 million of our indebtedness guaranteed by HUD that secured 12 separate facilities located in Arkansas. In connection with our disposition of the mortgages, we wrote-off approximately $0.6 million of unamortized deferred costs that are recorded in Gain on assets sold - net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These fixed rate mortgages had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.06% per annum and matured in July 2044.\n \u00b7 Mortgage interest income totaled $66.2 million, a decrease of $3.6 million over the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to mortgage loan payoffs, resulting in an $8.4 million reduction to interest income, offset by $4.8 million of incremental interest income from additional mortgage funding to our operators. \n(a)Includes amounts allocated to Omega stockholders and Omega OP Unit holders.\nAs a direct result of the challenges presented by the current operating environment in Texas as discussed under Overview and Outlook above, Daybreak requested further rent deferral. On January 30, 2019, we entered into a Second Amendment to Settlement and Forbearance Agreement under which we agreed to defer approximately $4.2 million of rent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and approximately $2.5 million (or approximately one month's rent) in each of the first two quarters of 2019. We believe these rent deferrals position Daybreak to continue to embark on certain operational improvements and to provide Daybreak time to receive the benefits of a significant increased participation in a Texas program providing SNF operators enhanced reimbursement for quality of care in its nursing facilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $0.8 million of state and local income tax provision and approximately $2.2 million of tax provision for foreign income taxes.\nOn January 11, 2019, pursuant to a Bankruptcy Court order, affiliates of Orianna purchased the remaining 15 SNFs subject to the direct financing lease with Orianna for $176 million of consideration, comprised of $146 million in cash received by Orianna and a $30.0 million seller note held by the Company. The $30.0 million note bears interest at 6% per annum and matures on January 11, 2026. Interest on the unpaid principal balance is due quarterly in arrears. Commencing on January 11, 2022, quarterly principal payments are due based on a 15-year amortization schedule on the then outstanding principal balance of the loan. On the same date, Orianna repaid the DIP financing, including all related interest.\nThe following table shows the amounts due in connection with the contractual obligations described below as of December 31, 2018:\nTo provide liquidity to Orianna during their Chapter 11 proceedings, we entered into a senior secured superpriority debtor-in-possession ( DIP\u201d) credit agreement with Orianna for a revolving credit and term loan DIP financing of up to $30 million, which DIP financing was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on an interim basis on March 9, 2018 and on a final basis on May 14, 2018.\nOn the same dates listed above, the Omega OP Unit holders received the same distributions per unit as those paid to the common stockholders of Omega.\n \u00b7 $9.1 million of new investments with an existing operator in the U.K. The investments included two care homes (similar to ALFs in the U.S.) acquired from an unrelated third party and leased to an existing operator. The two care homes were added to the existing operator's master lease with an initial annual cash yield of 8.5% with 2.5% annual escalators. \n (1) We recorded a non-cash deferred tax liability of approximately $0.4 million in connection with this acquisition \nAs healthcare delivery continues to evolve, we continuously evaluate our assets, our operators and our markets to position our portfolio for long-term success. Our strategy includes applying data analytics to enhance facility operations, investment underwriting and asset management, as well as selling or transitioning assets that do not meet our portfolio criteria.\n (5) We paid approximately $3.5 million in cash to acquire the facility. The remainder of the purchase price (approximately $5.5 million) was funded with the redemption of an other investment note. \n \u00b7 We also acquired nine SNFs and one ALF for approximately $60.7 million throughout the U.S. and invested an additional $10.0 million in an existing $50.0 million mezzanine loan. The annual interest rate was fixed at 12.0% per annum and the maturity date of the mezzanine loan was extended to May 2023. \n \u00b7 Rental income was $767.3 million, a decrease of $7.8 million over the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily the loss of rental income from facility sales and placing operators on cash basis in 2017 and 2018 as a result of non-payment of rent and/or concerns over the collectability of rents. The decreases were offset by facility transitions and acquisitions in the U.S. and lease amendments made throughout 2017 and 2018. \n (ii) uncertainties relating to the business operations of the operators of our assets, including those relating to reimbursement by third-party payors, regulatory matters and occupancy levels; \n \u00b7 Our impairment on real estate properties was $29.8 million, compared to $99.1 million for the same period in 2017. The 2018 impairments primarily related to 35 facilities to reduce their net book value to their estimated fair value less costs to sell or fair value. The 2017 impairments primarily related to 37 facilities to reduce their net book value to their estimated fair value less costs to sell or fair value. The 2018 and 2017 impairments were primarily the result of decisions to exit certain non-strategic facilities and/or operators. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total other expenses were $201.1 million, a decrease of approximately $8.2 million over the same period in 2017. The $8.2 million decrease was primarily the result of a $22.0 million decrease in interest refinancing costs related to early extinguishment costs incurred in 2017 to redeem the $400 million 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 and the write-off of deferred costs related to the 2014 credit facility, offset by a $10.4 million contractual settlement with an unrelated third party related to a contingent liability obligation that originated in 2012 that was resolved in the first quarter of 2017 and a $3.7 million increase in interest expense related to higher debt balances outstanding to fund new investments and higher blended borrowing costs in 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $63.5 million on 32 facilities (two were subsequently reclassified to held for sale). Of the $63.5 million impairment on real estate properties, $12.6 million related to one facility that was destroyed in a fire.\nOther Income (Expense)\n\n (xi) changes in interest rates; \n \u00b7 Our general and administrative expense was $47.7 million, compared to $45.9 million for the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily related to professional service costs and stock based compensation expense. \n \u00b7 Direct financing lease income was $32.3 million, a decrease of $30.0 million over the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily related to placing Orianna on a cash basis effective July 1, 2017 due to Orianna's non-payment of rent. \nOur Nareit FFO, for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $444.3 million, compared to $660.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of (i) Omega, (ii) Omega OP, and (iii) all direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Omega OP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any material properties or operators with facilities that are not materially occupied.\nOur funds from operations ( Nareit FFO\u201d), for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $587.4 million, compared to $444.3 million for the same period in 2017.\n \u00b7 common stock dividends; and \nAs a result of Orianna not satisfying the contractual payments due under the terms of the direct financing leases or the separate operating lease and the uncertainty of collection, we have not recognized any income from Orianna related to the direct financing leases or the operating lease for the period from July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded approximately $53.9 million of net gain on assets sold, as compared to $50.2 million for the same period in 2016. During 2017 and 2016, we sold 52 facilities and 38 facilities, respectively, as we continue to exit certain facilities, operator relationships and/or states to improve the strength of our overall portfolio.\n (i) those items discussed under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A to our annual report on Form 10-K; \n (7) The cash yield is based on the purchase price. \nIn the case of rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis, we generally record reserves against earned revenues from leases when collection becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators result in significant uncertainty regarding ultimate collection. The amount of the reserve is estimated based on what management believes will likely be collected. We continually evaluate the collectability of our straight-line rent assets. If it appears that we will not collect future rent due under our leases, we will record a provision for loss related to the straight-line rent asset.\n2018 Acquisitions and Other\n\nFinancing Activities\n \u00b7 Our general and administrative expense was $63.5 million, compared to $47.7 million for the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily related to professional service costs and stock based compensation expense. \nOn January 16, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Orianna's Plan, creating a Distribution Trust (the Trust\u201d) to distribute the proceeds from Orianna's sale of the remaining 15 SNFs, as well as the Trust's collections of Orianna's accounts receivable portfolio. Our remaining investment in the direct financing lease and the revolving working capital loan as of December 31, 2018 is expected to be recovered through liquidating payments made from the Trust. The Trust is comprised of $115.8 million of net cash proceeds from the sale by Orianna of the 15 SNFs on January 11, 2019 after repayment of the DIP financing, cash of $5.6 million, and accounts receivable, net of estimated allowance, of $21.3 million. We expect that the aggregate of such amounts will be used to pay the estimated costs of $26.9 million to other creditors and to wind down the Trust with the remainder paid to us under the direct financing leases and on account of the revolving working capital loan. The amount payable to us is contingent upon the collection of the accounts receivable balances and the estimated costs to wind down the Trust. These amounts are estimated and subject to change. Such changes could be significantly different than the currently estimated amounts and such differences could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nDepreciation and Real Estate Investment Impairment\nWe review our accounts receivable to determine their collectability. The determination of collectability of these assets requires significant judgment and is affected by several factors relating to the credit quality of our operators that we regularly monitor, including (i) payment history, (ii) the age of the contractual receivables, (iii) the current economic conditions and reimbursement environment, (iv) the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease and/or contractual loan agreements and (v) the value of the underlying collateral of the agreement. If we determine collectability of any of our contractual receivables is at risk, we estimate the potential uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance. In the case of a lease recognized on a straight-line basis, a mortgage recognized on an effective yield basis or the existence of lease inducements, we generally provide an allowance for straight-line, effective interest, and or lease inducement accounts receivable when certain conditions or indicators of adverse collectability are present. If the accounts receivable balance is subsequently deemed uncollectible, the receivable and allowance for doubtful account balance are written off.\nSubstantially all of our operating leases contain provisions for specified annual increases over the rents of the prior year and are generally computed in one of three methods depending on specific provisions of each lease as follows: (i) a specific annual increase over the prior year's rent, generally between 2.0% and 3.0%; (ii) an increase based on the change in pre-determined formulas from year to year (e.g. increases in the Consumer Price Index); or (iii) specific dollar increases over prior years. Revenue under lease arrangements with minimum fixed and determinable increases is recognized over the non-cancellable term of the lease on a straight-line basis. The authoritative guidance does not provide for the recognition of contingent revenue until all possible contingencies have been eliminated. We consider the operating history of the lessee, the payment history, the general condition of the industry and various other factors when evaluating whether all possible contingencies have been eliminated.\n (3) We also recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $1.9 million in connection with the acquisition. \n (2) We recorded a non-cash deferred tax liability of approximately $0.2 million in connection with this acquisition. \nHUD Mortgage Disposition\n \u00b7 provide capital expenditure funds to be used for the general maintenance and capital improvements of our 58 facilities in the amount of approximately $4.5 million per year for 3 years; \n \u00b7 debt service payments; \n\nManagement evaluates our real estate investments for impairment indicators at each reporting period, including the evaluation of our assets' useful lives. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as, but not limited to, market conditions, operator performance including the current payment status of contractual obligations and expectations of the ability to meet future contractual obligations, legal structure, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. If indicators of impairment are present, management evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to management's estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are generally based on the related lease which relates to one or more properties and may include cash flows from the eventual disposition of the asset. In some instances, there may be various potential outcomes for a real estate investment and its potential future cash flows. In these instances, the undiscounted future cash flows used to assess the recoverability are probability-weighted based on management's best estimates as of the date of evaluation. Provisions for impairment losses related to long-lived assets are recognized when expected future undiscounted cash flows based on our intended use of the property are determined to be less than the carrying values of the assets. An adjustment is made to the net carrying value of the real estate investments for the excess of carrying value over fair value. The fair value of the real estate investment is determined based on current market conditions and considers matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties, recent sales data for comparable properties, and, where applicable, contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers. Additionally, our evaluation of fair value may consider valuing the property as a nursing home as well as alternative uses. All impairments are taken as a period cost at that time, and depreciation is adjusted going forward to reflect the new value assigned to the asset. Management's impairment evaluation process, and when applicable, impairment calculations involve estimation of the future cash flows from management's intended use of the property as well as the fair value of the property. Changes in the facts and circumstances that drive management's assumptions may result in an impairment to our assets in a future period that could be material to our results of operations.\n \u00b7 In 2017, we recorded $198.2 million of impairment loss on direct financing leases primarily resulting from (a) terminating Orianna's Texas region lease, (b) selling Orianna's Northwest region facilities and (c) the impairment of Orianna's Southeast region lease. \n (2) Acquired from a related party. \nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\n$500 Million Equity Shelf Program\n\nWe calculate and report Nareit FFO in accordance with the definition of Funds from Operations and interpretive guidelines issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( Nareit\u201d), and, consequently, Nareit FFO is defined as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d)), adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization and impairment on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. We believe that Nareit FFO is an important supplemental measure of our operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. Nareit FFO was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue. Nareit FFO herein is not necessarily comparable to Nareit FFO of other REITs that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us.\nAsset Sales, Impairments, Accounts Receivable and Other\nSee Portfolio and Other Developments below for a description of 2018 acquisitions and other investments.\nOn May 7, 2018, Omega and Signature Healthcare entered into a consensual, out-of-court restructuring agreement. The restructuring involves multiple third-party constituents, including other third-party landlords, a new working capital lender, medical malpractice claimants, and other third-party interests. As part of the restructuring, Signature Healthcare was reorganized to separate each of its primary portfolios with its major landlords into three distinct lease silos and separate virtually all other legal obligations. As part of this restructuring, Signature Healthcare formed Agemo Holdings LLC ( Agemo\u201d) to be the holding company of the leases and loans of ours, and for which we agreed to:\nLiquidity\nOperating Expenses\nOverview and Outlook\n (4) We paid $63.0 million in cash at closing to acquire the facilities. We paid an additional $1.5 million in April 2017 and the remaining $1.5 million in April 2018. The additional consideration paid was contractually determined and not contingent on other factors. \n (ix) changes in the financial position of our operators; \nWe record direct financing lease income on a constant interest rate basis over the term of the lease. Costs related to originating the direct financing leases are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to income from direct financing leases over the term of the direct financing leases. Allowances are provided against earned revenues from direct financing leases when collection of amounts due becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators lead to lower expectations regarding ultimate collection.\nAs of December 31, 2018, three facilities, totaling approximately $1.0 million are classified as assets held for sale. We expect to sell these facilities over the next twelve months.\n2018 and Recent Highlights\nNareit FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Nareit FFO as one of several criteria to measure the operating performance of our business. We further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization, impairment on real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, Nareit FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. We offer this measure to assist the users of our financial statements in evaluating our financial performance under GAAP, and Nareit FFO should not be considered a measure of liquidity, an alternative to net income or an indicator of any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including net income.", "item_7_text": " \u00b7 Our depreciation and amortization expense was $287.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $267.1 million for the same period in 2016. The increase of $20.5 million was primarily due to the acquisitions and the placement of assets in service during 2016 and 2017. \nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09 and its subsequent updates using a modified retrospective approach. As a result of adopting ASU 2014-09, we recognize any gains when we transfer control of a property and when it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the related consideration. As a result of adopting ASU 2014-09 and its updates on January 1, 2018, the Company recognized $10.0 million of deferred gain resulting from the sale of facilities to a third-party in December 2017 through opening equity on January 1, 2018.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $11.7 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $85.1 million as compared to the balance at December 31, 2017. The following is a discussion of changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nOn February 13, 2019, we received $78.8 million from the Trust as a partial liquidation of the Trust. We will receive other payments from the Trust when the accounts receivable are collected and as the estimated creditor claims and costs to wind down the Trust are finalized.\nWe believe that our operating results display the strength of our conservative balance sheet and operating model against the backdrop of a dynamic operating environment. We believe our operators will generally benefit from the October 2019 change in the Medicare prospective payment system from RUG-IV (driven by therapy volume) to the PDPM (driven by patient disease conditions), as well as from the projected growth in elderly demographics in the years to come. Increasing labor and liability costs, evolving reimbursement models, and localized occupancy trends may put near term financial strain on some operators within the skilled nursing industry, particularly in states with unfavorable Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n (4) All of the aforementioned acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. \n (vi) changes in our credit ratings and the ratings of our debt securities; \nThe Company has one reportable segment consisting of investments in healthcare-related real estate properties located in the United States ( U.S.\u201d) and the United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d). Our core business is to provide financing and capital to the long-term healthcare industry with a particular focus on skilled nursing facilities ( SNFs\u201d), and, to a lesser extent, assisted living facilities ( ALFs\u201d), independent living facilities ( ILFs\u201d) and rehabilitation and acute care facilities. Our core portfolio consists of long-term leases and mortgage agreements. All of our leases are triple-net\u201d leases, which require the operators (we use the term operator\u201d to refer to our tenants and mortgagors and their affiliates who manage and/or operate our properties) to pay all property-related expenses. Our mortgage revenue derives from fixed rate mortgage loans, which are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \u00b7 extend the term of the master lease by two years to December 31, 2030 and; \nDaybreak\n2016 Acquisitions and Other\n (3) The cash yield is based on the purchase price. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued approximately 0.7 million shares under the 2015 Equity Shelf Program, at an average price of $29.97 per share, net of issuance costs, generating net proceeds of approximately $19.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we issued approximately 0.7 million shares under the 2015 Equity Shelf Program, at an average price of $30.81 per share, net of issuance costs, generating net proceeds of approximately $22.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued approximately 2.3 million shares under the 2015 Equity Shelf Program, at an average price of $33.18 per share, net of issuance costs, generating net proceeds of approximately $75.5 million.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total other expenses were $209.3 million, an increase of approximately $33.6 million over the same period in 2016. The $33.6 million increase was primarily the result of a $24.7 million increase in interest expense related to higher debt balances outstanding to fund new investments and higher blended borrowing costs, a $19.9 million increase in interest refinancing costs related to early extinguishment costs incurred in 2017 to redeem the $400 million 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 and the write-off of deferred costs related to the 2014 credit facility, offset by a $10.4 million contractual settlement with an unrelated third party related to a contingent liability obligation that originated in 2012 that was resolved in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Board has declared common stock dividends as set forth below:\nOperating Revenues\nIn March 2018, Orianna commenced voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). As described in Orianna's filings with the Bankruptcy Court, we entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement ( RSA\u201d) that was expected to form the basis for Orianna's restructuring. The RSA provided for the recommencement, in April 2018, of partial rent payments at $1.0 million per month and established a specific timeline for the implementation of Orianna's planned restructuring. The RSA provided for the transition of 23 facilities to new operators and the potential sale of the remaining 19 facilities subject to the plan of reorganization (the Plan\u201d), if approved by the Bankruptcy Court.\nWe currently believe that our operators can generally meet their obligations to us, except us as discussed below. However, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an operator's results of operations and financial condition, which could adversely affect the operator's ability to meet its obligations to us.\nPortfolio and Other Developments\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we transitioned 22 facilities with a net carrying value of approximately $184.5 million from Orianna to five other existing operators with annual contractual rent of approximately $16.8 million. In addition, during the second half of 2018, we sold Orianna's headquarters and one SNF with a carrying value of approximately $5.5 million to unrelated third-parties for approximately $5.5 million.\nImpairments\nWe have various different investments that generate revenue, including leased and mortgaged properties, as well as other investments, which include secured and unsecured loans. We recognize rental income and other investment income as earned over the terms of the related leases and notes, respectively. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected using the effective interest method. In applying the effective interest method, the effective yield on a loan is determined based on its contractual payment terms, adjusted for prepayment terms.\n \u00b7 Other investment income totaled $40.2 million, an increase of $11.0 million over the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily related to the issuance of new notes and additional funding to existing operators. \nThe allowances for losses on mortgage notes receivable, other investments and direct financing leases (collectively, our loans\u201d) are maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses. The determination of the allowances is based on a quarterly evaluation of these loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We evaluate the collectability of our loans based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors, if applicable, and the value of the underlying collateral. If such factors indicate that there is greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements. Consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual status may be deemed impaired. To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we will return these loans to full accrual status. When management identifies potential loan impairment indicators, the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future cash flows. In cases where expected future cash flows are not readily determinable, the loan is written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral, if applicable. We may base our valuation on a loan's observable market price, if any, or the fair value of collateral, net of sales costs, if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the collateral.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $58.7 million on 29 facilities.\nOn January 2, 2019, Omega and Omega OP entered into the Merger Agreement with MedEquities and its subsidiary operating partnership and the general partner of its subsidiary operating partnership. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Omega will acquire MedEquities and MedEquities will be merged with and into Omega (the Merger\u201d) at the effective time of the Merger with Omega continuing as the surviving company. At the effective time, each outstanding share of MedEquities common stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.235 of a share of Omega common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) $2.00 in cash, without interest, subject to adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement under certain limited circumstances. As of December 31, 2018, the total consideration expected to be exchanged in the merger, including the assumption of debt is approximately $600 million. The Merger Agreement also provides that MedEquities will declare a special dividend of $0.21 per share of MedEquities common stock payable to the holders of record of MedEquities common stock as of the trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger, which dividend will be payable following the effective time of the Merger together with the cash consideration under the Merger Agreement.\n \u00b7 Our impairment on direct financing leases was approximately $27.2 million, compared to $198.2 million for the same period in 2017. In 2017, we recorded $198.2 million of impairment loss on direct financing leases primarily resulting from (a) terminating Orianna's Texas region lease, (b) selling Orianna's Northwest region facilities and (c) the impairment of Orianna's Southeast region lease. In 2018, we recorded an additional $27.2 million impairment loss on the remaining 15 facilities in Orianna's Southeast region lease. \n2018 Taxes\nOperating Expenses\nThe following tables summarize the significant transactions that occurred between 2016 and 2018.\nNational Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Funds From Operations\n \u00b7 Rental income was $775.2 million, an increase of $31.3 million over the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily the result of facility acquisitions in the U.S. and the U.K. in 2016 and 2017 and lease amendments made throughout 2016 and 2017. These increases were offset by the loss of rental income from facility sales and placing one operator on a cash basis in 2017. \nAllowance for Losses on Mortgages, Other Investments and Direct Financing Leases\n \u00b7 $44.2 million first mortgage loan with an existing operator of ours. The loan is secured by five SNFs with 522 beds located in Michigan. The loan is cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with our existing loans and master lease with the operator. The loan bears an initial annual interest rate of 9.5%, which rate increases each year by 0.225%. \n\n \u00b7 Acquisition costs decreased by $9.6 million. The $9.6 million decrease was primarily due to the capitalization of acquisition costs in 2017. \nAs of December 31, 2018, we have completed substantially all of our strategic asset repositions and portfolio restructuring. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold 14 facilities (nine previously held for sale at September 30, 2018) subject to operating leases for approximately $63.2 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $15.5 million.\nOur operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $908.4 million, an increase of $7.6 million over the same period in 2016. Following is a description of certain of the changes in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016:\nOther Income (Expense)\nOur portfolio of investments at December 31, 2018, included 924 healthcare facilities, located in 41 states and the U.K. that are operated by 68 third-party operators. Our real estate investment in these facilities totaled approximately $8.6 billion at December 31, 2018, with 99% of our real estate investments related to long-term healthcare facilities. The portfolio is made up of (i) 735 SNFs, (ii) 116 ALFs, (iii) 14 specialty facilities, (iv) one medical office building, (v) fixed rate mortgages on 51 SNFs and three ALFs and (vi) four SNFs that are currently closed or held for sale. At December 31, 2018, we held other investments of approximately $504.6 million, consisting primarily of secured loans to third-party operators of our facilities and a $31.0 million investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.\nDuring 2018, we acquired two parcels of land (not reflected in the table above) for approximately $3.5 million with the intent of building new facilities for our existing operators.\n (3) In July 2017, we transitioned nine SNFs formerly subject to a direct financing lease to another operator. As a result of terminating the direct financing lease, we wrote down the facilities to our original cost basis and recorded an impairment on the direct financing lease of approximately $1.8 million. \n\nGain on Assets Sold\n (1) We recorded a non-cash deferred tax liability and acquisition costs of approximately $8.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in connection with this acquisition. \n \u00b7 Our depreciation and amortization expense was $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $287.6 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease of $6.3 million was primarily due to the timing of dispositions, impairments and normal decreases due to short lived assets becoming fully depreciated, offset by acquisitions and the placement of assets in service during 2017 and 2018. \n (xv) our ability to maintain our status as a REIT. \nAt December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $8.6 billion, total equity of $3.8 billion and debt of $4.6 billion, with such debt representing approximately 54.9% of total capitalization.\nAsset Sales\n (2) The cash yield is based on the purchase price. \nWe currently account for impaired loans using (a) the cost-recovery method, and/or (b) the cash basis method. We generally utilize the cost-recovery method for impaired loans for which impairment reserves were recorded. We utilize the cash basis method for impaired loans for which no impairment reserves were recorded because the net present value of the discounted cash flows expected under the loan and/or the underlying collateral supporting the loan were equal to or exceeded the book value of the loan. Under the cost-recovery method, we apply cash received against the outstanding loan balance prior to recording interest income. Under the cash basis method, we apply cash received to principal or interest income based on the terms of the agreement. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $108.1 million and $177.5 million, respectively, of reserves on our loans.\nAcquisition and Other Investments\n \u00b7 Our provision for uncollectible accounts was $6.7 million, compared to $14.6 million for the same period in 2017. The 2018 provision was primarily related to $11.5 million of reserves for straight line accounts receivable and contractual receivables resulting from facility transitions and placing an operator on a cash basis due to their non-payment of rent. Our provision was offset by a recovery of approximately $4.8 million from Orianna based on cash received pursuant to the RSA. The 2017 provision was primarily related to a $9.5 million reserve of contractual and straight line accounts receivable for Orianna and approximately $5.1 million related to other facilities that we have transitioned or sold. \nFor leases accounted for as operating leases, we retain ownership of the asset and record depreciation expense. We also record lease revenue based on the contractual terms of the operating lease agreement which often includes annual rent escalators, see Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\u201d below for further discussion regarding the recordation of revenue on our operating leases.\nAs part of the restructuring, Signature Healthcare entered into new working capital credit facilities with its new working capital lender for each of its separate silos, including Agemo. In addition, as part of our restructure, certain third-party guarantors of the Agemo master lease were required to contribute approximately $7.8 million in funds to the enterprise to be used to reduce the outstanding contractual receivables owed to us from Agemo. On May 8, 2018, we received $5.0 million in cash from the guarantors and a one-year term note from the principals of Agemo for approximately $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2018, Agemo is paying rent and interest pursuant to our lease and loan agreements.\nOperating Revenues\n (4) All of the aforementioned acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOn September 3, 2015, we entered into separate Equity Distribution Agreements (collectively, the Equity Shelf Agreements\u201d) to sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500 million (the 2015 Equity Shelf Program\u201d) with several financial institutions, each as a sales agent and/or principal (collectively, the Managers\u201d). Under the terms of the Equity Shelf Agreements, we may sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through or to the Managers having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500 million. Sales of the shares, if any, are made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at market prices, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable Manager. We pay each Manager compensation for sales of the shares equal to 2% of the gross sales price per share for shares sold through such Manager under the applicable Equity Shelf Agreements.\nItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n (1) The $4.6 billion of debt outstanding includes: (i) $313.0 million in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility due in May 2021, (ii) $128.0 million under the \u00a3100 million British Pound Sterling term loan facility due May 2022, (iii) $100 million under the Omega OP Term Loan Facility due May 2022, (iv) $250 million under the 2015 Term Loan Facility due December 2022, (v) $425 million under the U.S. Term Loan Facility due May 2022, (vi) $400 million of 4.50% Senior Notes due January 2025, (vii) $400 million of 4.95% Senior Notes due April 2024, (viii) $550 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due January 2028, (ix) $600 million of 5.25% Senior Notes due January 2026, (x) $700 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due August 2023, (xi) $700 million of 4.5% Senior Notes due April 2027 and (xii) $20 million of 9.0% per annum subordinated debt maturing in December 2021. Other than the $100 million outstanding under the Omega OP Term Loan Facility, the Parent is the obligor of all outstanding debt. \nDividends\n (xiv) the potential impact of changes in the SNF and ALF markets or local real estate conditions on our ability to dispose of assets held for sale for the anticipated proceeds or on a timely basis, or to redeploy the proceeds therefrom on favorable terms; and \n (iv) our ability to re-lease, otherwise transition, or sell underperforming assets or assets held for sale on a timely basis and on terms that allow us to realize the carrying value of these assets; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $24.8 million of net gain on assets sold, as compared to $53.9 million for the same period in 2017. During 2018 and 2017, we sold 78 facilities and 52 facilities, respectively, as we continue to exit certain facilities, operator relationships and/or states to improve the strength of our overall portfolio.\nIn 2017, we sold eight facilities subject to direct financing leases with Orianna in the Northwest region and the Southeast region of the U.S. with a carrying value of approximately $36.4 million for approximately $33.3 million to unrelated third parties. We recorded approximately $3.3 million of impairment related to these sales. In addition, we transitioned nine SNFs, representing all of the facilities subject to another direct financing lease with Orianna in the Texas region, to an existing operator of ours pursuant to an operating lease. In connection with this transaction, we recorded the real estate properties at our original cost basis of approximately $19.0 million, eliminated our investment in the Texas region direct financing lease and recorded an impairment of approximately $1.8 million. In conjunction with this transaction, we also amended our Orianna Southeast region master lease to reduce the outstanding balance by $19.3 million. As a result of the lease amendment in 2017, we recorded impairment on our investment in direct financing lease of approximately $20.8 million in 2017.\nDuring 2018, we transitioned 21 SNFs and one ALF subject to direct financing leases (not reflected in the table above) with a net carrying value of approximately $184.5 million from an existing operator to five other existing operators subject to single or master operating leases with an initial annual cash yield of approximately 9%. We recorded approximately $184.5 million of real estate investments consisting of land ($11.2 million), building and site improvements ($159.1 million) and furniture and fixtures ($14.2 million) in partial satisfaction of the direct financing lease. In connection with these transitions, we provided the new operators with working capital loans with a maximum borrowing capacity of $45.7 million, commitments to fund capital improvements up to $10.6 million and indemnities with a maximum funding of $7.4 million. Claims against these indemnities must occur within 18 months to 36 months of the transition date. These indemnities were provided to the new operators upon transition and would be utilized in the event that the prior operator does not perform under their transition agreements. We do not expect to fund a material amount under these indemnity agreements.\nForward-Looking Statements, Reimbursement Issues and Other Factors Affecting Future Results\n \u00b7 extend a 7-year working capital term loan at 7% for an amount up to $25 million with a maturity date of April 30, 2025 ($14.3 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2018); \nAs of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $33.8 million of contractual receivables outstanding - net of allowances. Of the $33.8 million of contractual receivables outstanding - net of allowances, approximately $18.3 million relates to Agemo Holdings LLC ( Agemo\u201d an entity formed in May 2018 to silo the leases and loans formerly held by Signature Healthcare) and Daybreak Venture LLC ( Daybreak\u201d). Daybreak is on a cash basis of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition, see additional discussion below. In addition to the contractual receivables, we have approximately $43.5 million of straight-line rent receivables and/or lease inducements associated with these operators as of December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded approximately $83.2 million and $82.6 million, of rental income, respectively, and $3.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of other investment income from these operators. Additionally, $5.4 million of the $33.8 million of contractual receivables outstanding - net of allowances as of December 31, 2018, relates to one operator that continues to pay, although at times less than the monthly contractual rent due. We continue to monitor this operator, including their contractual payments and their operational performance to determine if it will impact our revenue recognition in future periods.\nAgreement to acquire MedEquities\n2017 Taxes\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we recorded an allowance for loss on direct financing leases of $172.2 million with Orianna covering 38 facilities in the Southeast region of the U.S. The amount of the allowance was determined based on the fair value of the facilities subject to the direct financing lease. To estimate the fair value of the underlying collateral, we utilized an income approach and Level 3 inputs. Our estimate of fair value assumed annual rents ranging between $32.0 million and $38.0 million, rental yields between 9% and 10%, current and projected operating performance of the facilities, coverage ratios and bed values. Our recorded investment in these direct financing leases, net of the $172.2 million of allowances, amounted to $337.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nIn 2016, we sold 38 facilities (three previously held for sale at December 31, 2015) subject to operating leases for approximately $169.6 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $50.2 million.\n\nDuring 2017, we acquired three parcels of land (not reflected in the table above) for approximately $6.7 million with the intent of building new facilities for existing operators.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we placed Daybreak on a cash basis for revenue recognition as a result of nonpayment. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we executed a Settlement and Forbearance Agreement with Daybreak which permitted Daybreak to defer payments of up to 23% of their contractual rent for the remainder of 2017, subject to certain conditions. Daybreak was in compliance with the agreement at September 30, 2018; however, during the fourth quarter of 2018, Daybreak fell behind on rent by approximately two months and accordingly was not in compliance with the 2017 Settlement and Forbearance Agreement as a result of not paying the full contractual amounts due.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold 32 facilities (two previously held for sale at September 30, 2017) subject to operating leases for approximately $188.0 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $46.4 million.\n (1) Our investment includes a purchase option buyout obligation with a fair value of approximately $29.6 million. We also acquired a term loan with a fair value of approximately $37.0 million which is recorded in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In August 2017, the purchase option buyout obligation was terminated and the operator used the proceeds to repay certain other investments. \nIn 2018, we sold 78 facilities (22 previously held for sale at December 31, 2017) subject to operating leases for approximately $309.6 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $24.8 million.\n\n (iii) the ability of any of our operators in bankruptcy to reject unexpired lease obligations, modify the terms of our mortgages and impede our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding and retain security deposits for the debtor's obligations, and other costs and uncertainties associated with operator bankruptcies; \n \u00b7 $35.1 million of new investments with an existing operator. The investment included acquisitions of three SNFs and one ILF from an unrelated third party. The four Pennsylvania facilities with 420 beds were added to an existing operator's master lease with an initial cash yield of 9.5% with 2.5% annual rent escalators. \nOur 2018, 2017 and 2016 recorded impairments were primarily the result of decisions to exit certain non-strategic facilities and/or operators. We reduced the net book value of the impaired facilities to their estimated fair values or, with respect to the facilities reclassified to assets held for sale, to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. To estimate the fair value of the facilities, we utilized a market approach which considered binding sale agreements (a Level 1 input) and/or Level 3 inputs which generally consist of non-binding offers from unrelated third parties.\nFinancing Activities and Borrowing Arrangements\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $99.1 million on 37 facilities including approximately $2.6 million of capitalized costs associated with the termination of construction projects with two of our operators. The total net recorded investment in these properties after impairments and excluding facilities previously sold was approximately $125.1 million as of December 31, 2017, with approximately $7.7 million related to properties classified as held for sale.\nOrianna\nLease Accounting\n \u00b7 Direct financing lease income was $1.6 million, a decrease of $30.7 million over the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily related to placing Orianna on a cash basis effective July 1, 2017 due to Orianna's non-payment of rent and the sale of a direct financing lease facility. \nOn July 23, 2018, we notified Orianna that it was in default under the DIP credit agreement. On July 25, 2018, Omega terminated the RSA with its tenant, 4 West Holdings, and the sponsor of Orianna's Plan.\n \u00b7 normal recurring expenses; \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $3.2 million on three facilities (two were subsequently reclassified to held for sale).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $35.0 million on 35 facilities. Our impairments were offset by $5.2 million of insurance proceeds received related to a facility destroyed in November 2017. The total net recorded investment in these properties after impairments and excluding facilities previously sold was approximately $14.8 million as of December 31, 2018, with approximately $1.0 million related to properties classified as held for sale.\nOperating Activities - Operating activities generated $499.4 million of net cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $577.9 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $78.5 million which is primarily due to the loss of direct financing lease income from Orianna and a $50.0 million payment to one of our operators to acquire a portion of their in-the-money purchase option of which approximately $28.4 million was recorded as a lease inducement.\nIn 2018, we completed the following transactions totaling approximately $471 million in new investments:\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this document, including statements regarding potential future changes in reimbursement. This document contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including all statements regarding future financial position and financial metrics, expected synergies and benefits, dividends and dividend plans, financing plans, and other expectations and beliefs regarding future events. These statements relate to our expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, performance and underlying assumptions and other statements other than statements of historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including, but not limited to, terms such as anticipate,\u201d if,\u201d may,\u201d plan,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d would,\u201d will,\u201d anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d believes,\u201d intends,\u201d should\u201d seeks,\u201d approximately,\u201d outlook,\u201d looking forward\u201d or comparable terms or the negative thereof. These statements are based on information available on the date of this filing and only speak as to the date hereof and no obligation to update such forward-looking statements should be assumed. Our actual results may differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things:\nThe following table presents our Nareit FFO results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded approximately $2.4 million of state and local income tax provision and approximately $0.8 million of tax provision for foreign income taxes.\nAt the inception of the lease and during the amendment process, we evaluate each lease to determine if the lease should be considered an operating lease, sales-type lease, or direct financing lease. As of December 31, 2018, we have determined that all but three of our leases should be accounted for as operating leases. The other three leases are accounted for as direct financing leases.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash flow from financing activities was an outflow of $410.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to an outflow of $303.8 million for the same period in 2017. The $106.9 million change in cash from financing activities was primarily related to (i) a net $77.0 million decrease in cash proceeds from our credit facility, (ii) a net $96.0 million decrease in cash from our other long-term borrowings, primarily resulting from the second quarter 2017 issuance of $550.0 million 4.75% Senior Notes due 2028 and $150.0 million 4.5% Senior Notes due 2025, offset by the repayment of the $400.0 million 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 and (iii) a $26.1 million increase in dividends paid, offset by (i) a $53.4 million increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, (ii) a $29.2 million decrease in financing related costs in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017 and (iii) a $10.1 million increase in net proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017.\nDuring 2016, we acquired five parcels of land (not reflected in the table above) for approximately $8.3 million with the intent of building new facilities for existing operators.\nMortgage interest income and other investment income is recognized as earned over the terms of the related mortgage notes or other investment, typically using the effective yield method. Allowances are provided against earned revenues from mortgage interest or other investment income when collection of amounts due becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators lead to lower expectations regarding ultimate collection.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that Orianna's Plan, if confirmed, would allow Orianna to use the value of Orianna's remaining facilities to pay the administrative costs of Orianna's Chapter 11 cases and to pay certain other creditor claims, with the net amount of such value being paid to us. As a result, we recorded $27.2 million in additional allowance for loss to reduce the remaining investment in the direct financing lease covering the remaining 15 facilities located in the Southeast region of the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, our net investment in the Orianna direct financing lease is approximately $120.5 million, net of an allowance of $103.2 million.\nWe have identified four significant accounting policies that we believe are critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant assumptions, judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, we believe the application of assumptions, judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The four critical accounting policies are:\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the performance of all of our operators, as well as industry trends and developments generally.\nGain on Assets Sold\nWe believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital, including cash from operations, our existing availability under our credit facilities, facility sales and expected proceeds from mortgage and other investment payoffs are adequate to finance operations, meet recurring debt service requirements and fund future investments through the next twelve months.\nIn 2018 we paid dividends of $528.7 million to our common stockholders.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our REIT taxable income\u201d (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain), and (ii) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum of certain items of non-cash income. In addition, if we dispose of any built-in gain asset during a recognition period, we will be required to distribute at least 90% of the built-in gain (after tax), if any, recognized on the disposition of such asset. Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. In addition, such distributions are required to be made pro rata, with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class, and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our REIT taxable income\u201d as adjusted, we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.\nBecause we qualify as a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income taxes on the REIT taxable income that we distribute to stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. For tax year 2018, we made common dividend payments of $528.7 million to satisfy REIT requirements relating to qualifying income. Subject to the limitation under the REIT asset test rules, we are permitted to own up to 100% of the stock of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d). We have elected for two of our subsidiaries to be treated as TRSs. One of our TRSs is subject to federal, state and local income taxes at the applicable corporate rates and the other is subject to foreign income taxes. As of December 31, 2018, one of our TRSs had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $5.8 million. The loss carry-forward is fully reserved as of December 31, 2018 with a valuation allowance due to uncertainties regarding realization.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $408.9 million, a decrease of approximately $238.3 million over the same period in 2017. Following is a description of certain of the changes in our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017:\nOf the 78 facilities sold during 2018, we sold 12 SNFs on June 1, 2018 secured by HUD mortgages to subsidiaries of an existing operator. The Company sold the 12 SNF facilities with carrying values of approximately $62 million for approximately $78 million which consisted of $25 million of cash consideration and their assumption of approximately $53 million of our HUD mortgages. Simultaneously, subsidiaries of the operator assumed our HUD restricted cash accounts, deposits and escrows. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $11 million after approximately $5 million of closing and other transaction related costs. In connection with this sale, we provided a principal of an existing operator an unsecured loan of approximately $39.7 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations. Operating cash flows have historically been determined by: (i) the number of facilities we lease or have mortgages on; (ii) rental and mortgage rates; (iii) our debt service obligations; (iv) general and administrative expenses and (v) our operators' ability to pay amounts owed. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by or used in financing activities and in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, especially to changes in interest rates. Changes in the capital markets environment may impact the availability of cost-effective capital and affect our plans for acquisition and disposition activity.\n \u00b7 In 2017, we recorded $99.1 million of impairments on real estate properties, compared to $58.7 million for the same period in 2016. The 2017 impairments primarily related to 37 facilities to reduce their net book value to their estimated fair value less costs to sell or fair value. In 2016, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $58.7 million on 29 facilities. The 2017 and 2016 impairments were primarily the result of decisions to exit certain non-strategic facilities and/or operators. \n\nCommon Dividends\n \u00b7 extend the maturity date of the existing term loan by two years to December 31, 2024. \nNational Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Funds From Operations\nUnder GAAP, real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value, if deemed impaired. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 40 years for buildings, eight to 15 years for site improvements, and three to ten years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold interests are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or term of the lease.\nAgemo\n \u00b7 growth through acquisitions of additional properties. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents our Nareit FFO results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n (x) the effect of economic and market conditions generally and, particularly, in the healthcare industry; \n \u00b7 Our provision for uncollectible accounts was $14.6 million for 2017, compared to $9.8 million for the same period in 2016. The 2017 provision was primarily related to a $9.5 million reserve of contractual and straight line accounts receivable for Orianna and approximately $5.1 million related to other facilities that we intend to transition or sell. In 2016, we recorded a $5.6 million provision on three loans reducing their book value to the fair value of the underlying collateral. In addition, in 2016 we entered into agreements to transition 28 facilities from one of our former operators to a new existing operator. As a result of the transition, we wrote off approximately $3.4 million of straight line receivable from the former operator. \n \u00b7 Other investment income totaled $29.2 million, an increase of $7.4 million over the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily related to the issuance of new notes and additional funding to existing operators. \n (v) the availability and cost of capital to us; \n \u00b7 defer up to $6.3 million of rent per annum for 3 years commencing May 1, 2018; \nOther\nWe regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flow from operations, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized rental revenue of approximately $58.1 million and expensed approximately $9.6 million of acquisition related costs in connection with the aforementioned acquisitions. No goodwill was recorded in connection with these acquisitions.\nOf the 52 facilities sold in 2017, the sale of ten of these facilities did not initially qualify for sale accounting under the full accrual method. The ten SNFs with a carrying value of approximately $23.2 million were sold to a third-party for approximately $43.3 million, resulting in a total gain of approximately $17.5 million after $2.6 million of closing costs. In connection with this sale, we provided the buyer a $10.0 million loan which was recorded in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized a net gain of approximately $7.5 million in 2017 and deferred $10.0 million of gain related to this sale. Upon our adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) on January 1, 2018, we recognized $10.0 million of deferred gain related to this sale through opening equity on January 1, 2018.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $647.1 million, an increase of approximately $256.0 million over the same period in 2016. Following is a description of certain of the changes in our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016:\nBecause we qualify as a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income taxes on the REIT taxable income that we distribute to stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. For tax year 2017, we made common dividend payments of $502.6 million to satisfy REIT requirements relating to qualifying income. Subject to the limitation under the REIT asset test rules, we are permitted to own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. We have elected for two of our subsidiaries to be treated as TRSs. One of our TRSs is subject to federal, state and local income taxes at the applicable corporate rates and the other is subject to foreign income taxes. As of December 31, 2017, one of our TRSs had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $5.4 million. The loss carry-forward is fully reserved as of December 31, 2017 with a valuation allowance due to uncertainties regarding realization.\nHUD Mortgage Disposition\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 $131.3 million secured term loan with an unrelated third party. The loan is secured by a collateral assignment of mortgages covering seven SNFs, three ILFs and one ALF located in Pennsylvania and Virginia. The loan bears an interest rate of 9.35%. On or before its maturity in 2019, we expect to obtain fee simple title to the facilities and add the facilities to an existing operator's master lease. \nIn 2017, we sold 52 facilities (14 previously held for sale at December 31, 2016) subject to operating leases for approximately $257.8 million in net proceeds recognizing a gain on sale of approximately $53.9 million.\nIn addition to our direct financing leases with Orianna Health Systems ( Orianna\u201d), we own three facilities and had leased them to Orianna under a master lease which was to expire in 2026. The remaining three facility lease is accounted for as an operating lease. Our recorded investment in the three facilities subject to this operating lease was $30.5 million as of December 31, 2018. On October 31, 2018, Orianna rejected the operating lease and as a result we transitioned the remaining three facilities to an existing operator during the first quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we also have a revolving working capital loan issued to Orianna with a balance outstanding as of December 31, 2018 of $15.2 million.\nThe following is our discussion of the consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity and capital resources, which should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized impairment losses on real estate investments of $29.8 million, $99.1 million and $58.7 million, respectively.\n \u00b7 capital improvement programs; \n (6) All of the aforementioned acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. \n \u00b7 $180.9 million of investments in our capital expenditure programs. \nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts Receivable\nFor leases accounted for as direct financing leases, we record the present value of the future minimum lease payments (utilizing a constant interest rate over the term of the lease agreement) as a receivable and record interest income based on the contractual terms of the lease agreement. Certain direct financing leases include annual rent escalators; see Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\u201d below for further discussion regarding the recording of interest income on our direct financing leases. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have no unamortized direct costs related to originating our direct financing leases recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn June 1, 2018, subsidiaries of an existing operator assumed approximately $53 million of our indebtedness guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d) that secured 12 separate facilities located in Arkansas. In connection with our disposition of the mortgages we wrote-off approximately $0.6 million of unamortized deferred costs that are recorded in Gain on assets sold - net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These fixed rate mortgages had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.06% per annum and matured in July 2044.\nOur operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, were $881.7 million, a decrease of $26.7 million over the same period in 2017. Following is a description of certain of the changes in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017:\n(a)Includes amounts allocated to Omega stockholders and Omega OP Unit holders.\nAlthough industry occupancy levels have declined in recent years, the occupancy levels of our facilities and our operator coverages remained stable overall for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018. Our operators continue to experience increased labor costs which we believe is manageable. In addition, our operators continue to see declines in their overall quality mix (Medicare and private pay) as a percentage of operator revenue, which has been driven principally by managed care pressure on lengths of stay and rates. Texas, which represents 10% of our investments as of December 31, 2018, presents a difficult operating environment for SNF operators as a result of lower statewide occupancy levels and a Medicaid rate reimbursement that we believe is among the lowest in the United States. A number of our operators have experienced lower operating margins on their SNFs in Texas as a result of the foregoing and labor costs. The acquisition of MedEquities will increase the percentage of our investments in Texas. We believe the long-term outlook in Texas is positive with favorable demographics, limited new supply, the implementation of the PDPM, and the possibility of Medicaid rate relief.\n2017 Acquisitions and Other\n \u00b7 Mortgage interest income totaled $70.3 million, an increase of $4.1 million over the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to incremental interest income from additional mortgage funding to our operators, offset by mortgage payoffs. \nInvesting Activities - Net cash flow from investing activities was an outflow of $173.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to an outflow of $285.1 million for the same period in 2017. The $111.9 million change in cash flow from investing activities related primarily to (i) a $280.3 million decrease in real estate acquisitions, (ii) a $51.8 million increase in proceeds from sale of real estate investments, (iii) a $7.9 million decrease in capital improvements to real estate investments and (iv) a $6.0 million increase in receipts from insurance proceeds. Offsetting these changes were: (i) a $161.0 million increase in other investments - net primarily related to funding more other investments in 2018, (ii) a $52.8 million increase in investments in construction in progress in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, (iii) a $12.3 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of direct financing lease assets and (iv) a $6.1 million increase in mortgages - net primarily related to funding additional mortgages in 2018.\nOn June 1, 2018, subsidiaries of an existing operator assumed approximately $53 million of our indebtedness guaranteed by HUD that secured 12 separate facilities located in Arkansas. In connection with our disposition of the mortgages, we wrote-off approximately $0.6 million of unamortized deferred costs that are recorded in Gain on assets sold - net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These fixed rate mortgages had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.06% per annum and matured in July 2044.\n \u00b7 Mortgage interest income totaled $66.2 million, a decrease of $3.6 million over the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to mortgage loan payoffs, resulting in an $8.4 million reduction to interest income, offset by $4.8 million of incremental interest income from additional mortgage funding to our operators. \n(a)Includes amounts allocated to Omega stockholders and Omega OP Unit holders.\nAs a direct result of the challenges presented by the current operating environment in Texas as discussed under Overview and Outlook above, Daybreak requested further rent deferral. On January 30, 2019, we entered into a Second Amendment to Settlement and Forbearance Agreement under which we agreed to defer approximately $4.2 million of rent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and approximately $2.5 million (or approximately one month's rent) in each of the first two quarters of 2019. We believe these rent deferrals position Daybreak to continue to embark on certain operational improvements and to provide Daybreak time to receive the benefits of a significant increased participation in a Texas program providing SNF operators enhanced reimbursement for quality of care in its nursing facilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $0.8 million of state and local income tax provision and approximately $2.2 million of tax provision for foreign income taxes.\nOn January 11, 2019, pursuant to a Bankruptcy Court order, affiliates of Orianna purchased the remaining 15 SNFs subject to the direct financing lease with Orianna for $176 million of consideration, comprised of $146 million in cash received by Orianna and a $30.0 million seller note held by the Company. The $30.0 million note bears interest at 6% per annum and matures on January 11, 2026. Interest on the unpaid principal balance is due quarterly in arrears. Commencing on January 11, 2022, quarterly principal payments are due based on a 15-year amortization schedule on the then outstanding principal balance of the loan. On the same date, Orianna repaid the DIP financing, including all related interest.\nThe following table shows the amounts due in connection with the contractual obligations described below as of December 31, 2018:\nTo provide liquidity to Orianna during their Chapter 11 proceedings, we entered into a senior secured superpriority debtor-in-possession ( DIP\u201d) credit agreement with Orianna for a revolving credit and term loan DIP financing of up to $30 million, which DIP financing was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on an interim basis on March 9, 2018 and on a final basis on May 14, 2018.\nOn the same dates listed above, the Omega OP Unit holders received the same distributions per unit as those paid to the common stockholders of Omega.\n \u00b7 $9.1 million of new investments with an existing operator in the U.K. The investments included two care homes (similar to ALFs in the U.S.) acquired from an unrelated third party and leased to an existing operator. The two care homes were added to the existing operator's master lease with an initial annual cash yield of 8.5% with 2.5% annual escalators. \n (1) We recorded a non-cash deferred tax liability of approximately $0.4 million in connection with this acquisition \nAs healthcare delivery continues to evolve, we continuously evaluate our assets, our operators and our markets to position our portfolio for long-term success. Our strategy includes applying data analytics to enhance facility operations, investment underwriting and asset management, as well as selling or transitioning assets that do not meet our portfolio criteria.\n (5) We paid approximately $3.5 million in cash to acquire the facility. The remainder of the purchase price (approximately $5.5 million) was funded with the redemption of an other investment note. \n \u00b7 We also acquired nine SNFs and one ALF for approximately $60.7 million throughout the U.S. and invested an additional $10.0 million in an existing $50.0 million mezzanine loan. The annual interest rate was fixed at 12.0% per annum and the maturity date of the mezzanine loan was extended to May 2023. \n \u00b7 Rental income was $767.3 million, a decrease of $7.8 million over the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily the loss of rental income from facility sales and placing operators on cash basis in 2017 and 2018 as a result of non-payment of rent and/or concerns over the collectability of rents. The decreases were offset by facility transitions and acquisitions in the U.S. and lease amendments made throughout 2017 and 2018. \n (ii) uncertainties relating to the business operations of the operators of our assets, including those relating to reimbursement by third-party payors, regulatory matters and occupancy levels; \n \u00b7 Our impairment on real estate properties was $29.8 million, compared to $99.1 million for the same period in 2017. The 2018 impairments primarily related to 35 facilities to reduce their net book value to their estimated fair value less costs to sell or fair value. The 2017 impairments primarily related to 37 facilities to reduce their net book value to their estimated fair value less costs to sell or fair value. The 2018 and 2017 impairments were primarily the result of decisions to exit certain non-strategic facilities and/or operators. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total other expenses were $201.1 million, a decrease of approximately $8.2 million over the same period in 2017. The $8.2 million decrease was primarily the result of a $22.0 million decrease in interest refinancing costs related to early extinguishment costs incurred in 2017 to redeem the $400 million 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 and the write-off of deferred costs related to the 2014 credit facility, offset by a $10.4 million contractual settlement with an unrelated third party related to a contingent liability obligation that originated in 2012 that was resolved in the first quarter of 2017 and a $3.7 million increase in interest expense related to higher debt balances outstanding to fund new investments and higher blended borrowing costs in 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded impairments on real estate properties of approximately $63.5 million on 32 facilities (two were subsequently reclassified to held for sale). Of the $63.5 million impairment on real estate properties, $12.6 million related to one facility that was destroyed in a fire.\nOther Income (Expense)\n\n (xi) changes in interest rates; \n \u00b7 Our general and administrative expense was $47.7 million, compared to $45.9 million for the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily related to professional service costs and stock based compensation expense. \n \u00b7 Direct financing lease income was $32.3 million, a decrease of $30.0 million over the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily related to placing Orianna on a cash basis effective July 1, 2017 due to Orianna's non-payment of rent. \nOur Nareit FFO, for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $444.3 million, compared to $660.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of (i) Omega, (ii) Omega OP, and (iii) all direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Omega OP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any material properties or operators with facilities that are not materially occupied.\nOur funds from operations ( Nareit FFO\u201d), for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $587.4 million, compared to $444.3 million for the same period in 2017.\n \u00b7 common stock dividends; and \nAs a result of Orianna not satisfying the contractual payments due under the terms of the direct financing leases or the separate operating lease and the uncertainty of collection, we have not recognized any income from Orianna related to the direct financing leases or the operating lease for the period from July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded approximately $53.9 million of net gain on assets sold, as compared to $50.2 million for the same period in 2016. During 2017 and 2016, we sold 52 facilities and 38 facilities, respectively, as we continue to exit certain facilities, operator relationships and/or states to improve the strength of our overall portfolio.\n (i) those items discussed under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A to our annual report on Form 10-K; \n (7) The cash yield is based on the purchase price. \nIn the case of rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis, we generally record reserves against earned revenues from leases when collection becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators result in significant uncertainty regarding ultimate collection. The amount of the reserve is estimated based on what management believes will likely be collected. We continually evaluate the collectability of our straight-line rent assets. If it appears that we will not collect future rent due under our leases, we will record a provision for loss related to the straight-line rent asset.\n2018 Acquisitions and Other\n\nFinancing Activities\n \u00b7 Our general and administrative expense was $63.5 million, compared to $47.7 million for the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily related to professional service costs and stock based compensation expense. \nOn January 16, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Orianna's Plan, creating a Distribution Trust (the Trust\u201d) to distribute the proceeds from Orianna's sale of the remaining 15 SNFs, as well as the Trust's collections of Orianna's accounts receivable portfolio. Our remaining investment in the direct financing lease and the revolving working capital loan as of December 31, 2018 is expected to be recovered through liquidating payments made from the Trust. The Trust is comprised of $115.8 million of net cash proceeds from the sale by Orianna of the 15 SNFs on January 11, 2019 after repayment of the DIP financing, cash of $5.6 million, and accounts receivable, net of estimated allowance, of $21.3 million. We expect that the aggregate of such amounts will be used to pay the estimated costs of $26.9 million to other creditors and to wind down the Trust with the remainder paid to us under the direct financing leases and on account of the revolving working capital loan. The amount payable to us is contingent upon the collection of the accounts receivable balances and the estimated costs to wind down the Trust. These amounts are estimated and subject to change. Such changes could be significantly different than the currently estimated amounts and such differences could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nDepreciation and Real Estate Investment Impairment\nWe review our accounts receivable to determine their collectability. The determination of collectability of these assets requires significant judgment and is affected by several factors relating to the credit quality of our operators that we regularly monitor, including (i) payment history, (ii) the age of the contractual receivables, (iii) the current economic conditions and reimbursement environment, (iv) the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease and/or contractual loan agreements and (v) the value of the underlying collateral of the agreement. If we determine collectability of any of our contractual receivables is at risk, we estimate the potential uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance. In the case of a lease recognized on a straight-line basis, a mortgage recognized on an effective yield basis or the existence of lease inducements, we generally provide an allowance for straight-line, effective interest, and or lease inducement accounts receivable when certain conditions or indicators of adverse collectability are present. If the accounts receivable balance is subsequently deemed uncollectible, the receivable and allowance for doubtful account balance are written off.\nSubstantially all of our operating leases contain provisions for specified annual increases over the rents of the prior year and are generally computed in one of three methods depending on specific provisions of each lease as follows: (i) a specific annual increase over the prior year's rent, generally between 2.0% and 3.0%; (ii) an increase based on the change in pre-determined formulas from year to year (e.g. increases in the Consumer Price Index); or (iii) specific dollar increases over prior years. Revenue under lease arrangements with minimum fixed and determinable increases is recognized over the non-cancellable term of the lease on a straight-line basis. The authoritative guidance does not provide for the recognition of contingent revenue until all possible contingencies have been eliminated. We consider the operating history of the lessee, the payment history, the general condition of the industry and various other factors when evaluating whether all possible contingencies have been eliminated.\n (3) We also recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $1.9 million in connection with the acquisition. \n (2) We recorded a non-cash deferred tax liability of approximately $0.2 million in connection with this acquisition. \nHUD Mortgage Disposition\n \u00b7 provide capital expenditure funds to be used for the general maintenance and capital improvements of our 58 facilities in the amount of approximately $4.5 million per year for 3 years; \n \u00b7 debt service payments; \n\nManagement evaluates our real estate investments for impairment indicators at each reporting period, including the evaluation of our assets' useful lives. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as, but not limited to, market conditions, operator performance including the current payment status of contractual obligations and expectations of the ability to meet future contractual obligations, legal structure, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. If indicators of impairment are present, management evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to management's estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are generally based on the related lease which relates to one or more properties and may include cash flows from the eventual disposition of the asset. In some instances, there may be various potential outcomes for a real estate investment and its potential future cash flows. In these instances, the undiscounted future cash flows used to assess the recoverability are probability-weighted based on management's best estimates as of the date of evaluation. Provisions for impairment losses related to long-lived assets are recognized when expected future undiscounted cash flows based on our intended use of the property are determined to be less than the carrying values of the assets. An adjustment is made to the net carrying value of the real estate investments for the excess of carrying value over fair value. The fair value of the real estate investment is determined based on current market conditions and considers matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties, recent sales data for comparable properties, and, where applicable, contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers. Additionally, our evaluation of fair value may consider valuing the property as a nursing home as well as alternative uses. All impairments are taken as a period cost at that time, and depreciation is adjusted going forward to reflect the new value assigned to the asset. Management's impairment evaluation process, and when applicable, impairment calculations involve estimation of the future cash flows from management's intended use of the property as well as the fair value of the property. Changes in the facts and circumstances that drive management's assumptions may result in an impairment to our assets in a future period that could be material to our results of operations.\n \u00b7 In 2017, we recorded $198.2 million of impairment loss on direct financing leases primarily resulting from (a) terminating Orianna's Texas region lease, (b) selling Orianna's Northwest region facilities and (c) the impairment of Orianna's Southeast region lease. \n (2) Acquired from a related party. \nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\n$500 Million Equity Shelf Program\n\nWe calculate and report Nareit FFO in accordance with the definition of Funds from Operations and interpretive guidelines issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( Nareit\u201d), and, consequently, Nareit FFO is defined as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d)), adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization and impairment on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. We believe that Nareit FFO is an important supplemental measure of our operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. Nareit FFO was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue. Nareit FFO herein is not necessarily comparable to Nareit FFO of other REITs that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us.\nAsset Sales, Impairments, Accounts Receivable and Other\nSee Portfolio and Other Developments below for a description of 2018 acquisitions and other investments.\nOn May 7, 2018, Omega and Signature Healthcare entered into a consensual, out-of-court restructuring agreement. The restructuring involves multiple third-party constituents, including other third-party landlords, a new working capital lender, medical malpractice claimants, and other third-party interests. As part of the restructuring, Signature Healthcare was reorganized to separate each of its primary portfolios with its major landlords into three distinct lease silos and separate virtually all other legal obligations. As part of this restructuring, Signature Healthcare formed Agemo Holdings LLC ( Agemo\u201d) to be the holding company of the leases and loans of ours, and for which we agreed to:\nLiquidity\nOperating Expenses\nOverview and Outlook\n (4) We paid $63.0 million in cash at closing to acquire the facilities. We paid an additional $1.5 million in April 2017 and the remaining $1.5 million in April 2018. The additional consideration paid was contractually determined and not contingent on other factors. \n (ix) changes in the financial position of our operators; \nWe record direct financing lease income on a constant interest rate basis over the term of the lease. Costs related to originating the direct financing leases are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to income from direct financing leases over the term of the direct financing leases. Allowances are provided against earned revenues from direct financing leases when collection of amounts due becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators lead to lower expectations regarding ultimate collection.\nAs of December 31, 2018, three facilities, totaling approximately $1.0 million are classified as assets held for sale. We expect to sell these facilities over the next twelve months.\n2018 and Recent Highlights\nNareit FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Nareit FFO as one of several criteria to measure the operating performance of our business. We further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization, impairment on real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, Nareit FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. We offer this measure to assist the users of our financial statements in evaluating our financial performance under GAAP, and Nareit FFO should not be considered a measure of liquidity, an alternative to net income or an indicator of any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including net income.", "item_7_tables": "Table 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td>
