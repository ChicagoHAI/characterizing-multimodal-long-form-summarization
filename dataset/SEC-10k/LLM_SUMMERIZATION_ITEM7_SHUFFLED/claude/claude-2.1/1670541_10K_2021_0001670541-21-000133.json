Adient was incorporated under the laws of Ireland in fiscal 2016 for the purpose of holding these businesses. Adient's ordinary shares began trading \"regular-way\" under the ticker symbol \"ADNT\" on the New York Stock Exchange on October 31, 2016. Upon becoming an independent company, the capital structure of Adient consisted of 500 million authorized ordinary shares and 100 million authorized preferred shares (par value of $0.001 per ordinary and preferred share). The number of Adient ordinary shares issued on October 31, 2016 was 93,671,810.\nOverview\nAdient is a global leader in the automotive seating supply industry with relationships with the largest global auto manufacturers. Adient's technologies extend into virtually every area of automotive seating solutions, including complete seating systems, frames, mechanisms, foam, head restraints, armrests and trim covers. Adient is an independent seat supplier with global scale and the capability to design, develop, engineer, manufacture and deliver complete seat systems and components in every major automotive producing region in the world.\nAdient designs, manufactures and markets a full range of seating systems and components for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and light trucks, including vans, pick-up trucks and sport/crossover utility vehicles. Adient operates in 208 wholly- and\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 30\nmajority-owned manufacturing or assembly facilities, with operations in 33 countries. Additionally, Adient has partially-owned affiliates in China, Asia, Europe and North America. Through its global footprint and vertical integration, Adient leverages its capabilities to drive growth in the automotive seating industry.\nAdient manages its business on a geographic basis and operates in the following three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; 2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\") and 3) Asia Pacific/China (\"Asia\").\nAdient evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using an adjusted EBITDA metric defined as income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, restructuring related-costs, net mark-to-market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans, transaction gains/losses, purchase accounting amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"). Also, certain corporate-related costs are not allocated to the segments. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets served by Adient and reflect the financial information that is reviewed by its chief operating decision maker. Refer to Note 18, \"Segment Information,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on Adient's reportable segments.\nSupply Chain Disruptions and Inflationary Pressures\nThe global automotive industry continues to experience widespread supply chain disruptions primarily related to semiconductor chip shortages. Although Adient's seating products are not highly dependent on semiconductor chips, Adient is directly impacted by the lower production levels at the OEM's as a result of these supply disruptions. These disruptions have led to unplanned downtime at Adient's production facilities, often with very little warning, which results in operating inefficiencies and limits Adient's ability to adequately mitigate such inefficiencies. The automotive industry has also experienced a period of sustained price increases for commodities, primarily related to steel, and to a lesser extent petrochemicals. Shipping costs have also sharply increased throughout the fiscal year. These commodity and shipping cost increases may continue into the future as demand increases and supply may remain constrained, which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset. Adient is also closely monitoring labor availability and wage inflationary pressures, both internally and at key vendors, to assess any impact labor shortages and wage inflation might have on Adient's ability to perform its obligations. Although Adient has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, commodity and shipping costs, these strategies (which include targeted SG&A savings through hiring freezes, delayed merit increases, suspended 401(k) matches in the U.S. and RSU replacement awards in lieu of salary for certain executives of Adient), together with commercial negotiations with Adient's customers and suppliers, are only expected to offset a portion of the adverse impact. Refer to the consolidated results of operations and segment analysis discussion below for additional information on the impacts of these items on Adient's results. Also refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors section for additional information.\nOn-Going Impact of COVID-19\nThe impact of COVID-19, and related mutations, continues to be present throughout the world, including in all global and regional markets served by Adient. Although vaccines have been introduced that are expected to have the result of reducing the effect of COVID-19 and COVID-19 started to wane in certain geographic areas, governmental authorities continue to implement numerous measures attempting to contain and mitigate the effects of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, social distancing orders, shelter in place orders and shutdowns of non-essential activities. Adient's manufacturing facilities are located in areas that continue to be affected by the pandemic.\nAs previously disclosed, beginning at the end of January 2020 and continuing through June 2020, Adient experienced the shutdown of its facilities in all geographic regions (Asia, Americas and EMEA) at various points in time. Production finally started to resume in all regions and continued to ramp up through Adient's fiscal fourth quarter, and as of December 31, 2020, virtually all of Adient's plants had resumed production.\nAlthough the global automotive industry experienced increased demand for new vehicles as Adient emerged from the global shutdowns in late fiscal year 2020 and early fiscal year 2021, it is possible that, in the event of the resurgence of COVID-19, the global automotive industry will experience significantly lower demand for new vehicle sales over the long-term as a result of the global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic because new vehicle sales are highly dependent on strong consumer confidence and low unemployment. As a result, new vehicle sales could be significantly lower than historical and previously projected pre-pandemic sales levels.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 31\nThroughout fiscal year 2020 and 2021 and into fiscal year 2022, Adient continues to actively monitor the threat and impacts of COVID-19. Adient has taken, and continues to take, steps to mitigate the potential risks to the Company posed by COVID-19 and its impacts. In addition, Adient continues to assess and update its business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic, including analyzing constraints at its customers and suppliers, particularly components and labor-related shortages, respectively. Adient has taken precautions to help keep its workforce healthy and safe, including establishing a Global Response Team, implementing strict travel restrictions, enforcing rigorous hygiene protocols, increasing sanitization efforts at all facilities, enacting visitor restrictions, social distancing, face covering expectations, and temperature and health screenings and implementing remote working arrangements for the vast majority of Adient's employees who work outside the plants.\nAdient took significant measures to reduce its overall cash burn rate (defined as net cash outflow associated with operating the company) during the shutdown, including the furlough of direct/salary plant workers, reductions of salaries in all areas of the globe and retirement benefits for U.S. employees outside the plants, reduced/delayed capex spending to coincide with the resumption of production and effectively eliminating all discretionary spending.\nIn addition to the significant measures taken to reduce and contain costs, Adient took actions to provide additional liquidity, primarily including the draw down on its ABL revolving credit facility of $825 million at the end of March 2020 and the issuance of $600 million of senior secured notes due 2025 on April 20, 2020. Adient's ability to borrow against the ABL revolving credit facility is limited to its borrowing base, which consists primarily of accounts receivable, inventory and certain cash account balances at certain Adient subsidiaries. Adient repaid $825 million of the ABL revolving credit facility during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 and maintains $739 million of availability under the ABL revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2021.\nThe automotive production shutdown in fiscal 2020 also significantly impacted Adient's daily working capital. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient experienced significantly lower trade working capital balances (accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable) due to the shutdown of production in the early part of the third quarter and resumption of production only toward the latter part of the quarter. Trade working capital was favorably impacted during the early part of the third quarter but was more than offset by the unfavorable impact to trade working capital during the latter part of the quarter. The resumption of production in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 had a favorable impact to trade working capital as Adient returned to a more stabilized production run rate.\nAdient has also pursued, wherever it qualifies, governmental assistance. For example, Adient deferred the employer portion of FICA until fiscal 2021 or beyond and deferred VAT payments. Adient is seeking to take advantage of all such assistance to either defer payments to government authorities or to receive cash to help defray operating costs. Adient cannot guarantee that it will continue to qualify for, or receive any of, the assistance that it is pursuing.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken to restrain the spread of the virus have had, and may continue to have, a material negative impact on Adient's financial results and liquidity, and such negative impact may continue well beyond the containment of COVID-19 through the results of widespread use of the vaccine or otherwise. Adient cannot assure that the assumptions used to estimate its liquidity requirements will be correct because it has never previously experienced such a widespread cessation of its operations as it experienced during fiscal year 2020, and it is unclear what the lasting impacts of the slowdown in the automotive industry will be. In addition, the magnitude, duration, speed and potential resurgence or surges of the global pandemic are all uncertain. Consequently, the impact of the pandemic and its myriad of effects on Adient's business, financial condition or longer-term financial or operational results remain uncertain. Based on the actions it has taken and its current assumptions regarding the impact of COVID-19, Adient believes that its current financial resources will be sufficient to fund the company's liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nGlobal Automotive Industry\nAdient conducts its business globally in the automotive industry, which is highly competitive and sensitive to economic, political and social factors in the various regions. During fiscal 2020, automotive production across the globe declined due to the economic slow down resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2021, automotive production at the beginning of the year was higher in all regions, but experienced a slow down in the second half of the fiscal year due to the widespread supply chain disruptions impacting the global automotive industry.\nLight vehicle production levels by geographic region are provided below:\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 32\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Light Vehicle Production </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(units in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global </td> <td> </td> <td>79.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>73.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-17.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>89.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-22.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South America </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-30.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-25.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>China </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-6.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia, excluding China, and Other </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-14.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Source: IHS Automotive, October 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Results Summary\nSignificant aspects of Adient's financial results for fiscal 2021 include the items discussed below. The recently completed transactions in China had a significant impact on the fiscal 2021 financial results. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on these transactions.\n\u2022Adient recorded net sales of $13,680 million for fiscal 2021, representing an increase of $1,010 million when compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales is attributable to prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, the favorable impact of foreign currencies and favorable material economics recoveries, partially offset by current year temporary operational interruptions and production stoppages primarily resulting from semiconductor chip shortages, and prior year divestitures primarily consisting of the fabrics businesses, and unfavorable commercial settlements.\n\u2022Gross profit was $826 million, or 6.0% of net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to $592 million, or 4.7% of net sales for fiscal 2020. Profitability, including gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was higher due to higher current year volumes primarily resulting from prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, current year operational improvements, a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits, the favorable impact of foreign currencies, and favorable commercial settlements, partially offset by temporary operational inefficiencies and premium freight caused by unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor chip shortages, and unfavorable impacts of material economics, net of recoveries.\n\u2022Equity income was $1,484 million for fiscal 2021, which compares to equity income of $22 million for fiscal 2020. The significant increase is primarily attributable to a $1,181 million current year gain recognized upon sales of certain of Adient's equity interests in China as part of the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction and $33 million current year gain on the sale of SJA, favorable impact of foreign currencies, a $231 million prior year non-cash impairment of the YFAI investment as part of the 2020 Yanfeng transaction, and operational performance improvements primarily at Adient's affiliates in China. Excluding the impacts of current year transactional gains and prior year impairments, equity income increased by $17 million.\n\u2022Net income attributable to Adient was $1,108 million for fiscal 2021, compared to a loss of $547 million for fiscal 2020. The increased net income attributable to Adient is due to $1,214 million of one-time gains from sales of certain of Adient's equity interests in China, higher current year volumes primarily resulting from prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, current year operational improvements, lower restructuring charges, a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits, and a $231 million prior year non-cash impairment of the YFAI investment, partially offset by operational inefficiencies and premium freight caused by unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages, higher net financing charges, and higher income tax expense primarily resulting from the withholding taxes paid in association with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 33\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nSeptember 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,526 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales </td> <td> </td> <td>12,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>12,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23)% </td> <td> </td> <td>15,725 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40% </td> <td> </td> <td>592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26)% </td> <td> </td> <td>801 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4)% </td> <td> </td> <td>558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17)% </td> <td> </td> <td>671 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on business divestitures -

The cost of sales year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in all regions ($507 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($258 million), higher commodity costs ($150 million), temporary operational inefficiencies including premium freight and unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages and to a lesser extent COVID-19 related costs ($165 million) and prior year non-recurring favorable benefits related to actions taken as described in the On-Going Impact of COVID-19 section above ($36 million), partially offset by the impact of prior year divestitures primarily consisting of the RECARO and fabrics businesses ($120 million), overall operational performance improvements ($106 million), favorable material margins ($76 million), and a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits ($38 million). The increase in gross profit was due to higher overall volumes, the favorable impact of foreign currencies, operational performance improvements, the favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments, including material economics, and the one-time gain in Brazil, partially offset by higher commodity costs, inefficiencies caused by unplanned production stoppages and certain prior year incentive compensation costs and to a lesser extent other benefits that were not expected to recur.

Cost of sales were lower primarily due to the decrease in sales volumes as a result of the COVID-19 impact along with overall business performance improvements, the favorable impact of foreign currency ($195 million), and the impact of divestitures primarily related to RECARO ($97 million). Gross profit was lower as a result of the negative impact of lower sales volume due to the COVID-19 impact, partially offset by the impact of business performance improvements including lower launch inefficiencies, and reductions in operational waste and freight along with favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments.

The significant increase during fiscal 2021 was due primarily to a one-time gain associated with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction ($1,181 million), one-time gain associated with the sale of Adient's interest in SJA ($33 million), a prior year non-cash impairment charge related to Adient's YFAI investment divestiture ($231 million), a one-time gain on previously held interest at YFAS in an affiliate during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 ($5 million), favorable impact of foreign currencies ($19 million), and prior year lower production volumes within Adient's China affiliates due to the impact of COVID-19 primarily during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 despite the current year operational interruptions and temporary production stoppages resulting from semiconductor chip shortages ($27 million). These were partially offset by the impact of prior year divestitures of YFAI and the fabrics business as well as current year divestiture of SJA ($30 million), and prior year tax benefits at various China affiliates that are not expected to recur ($10 million). As a result of the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction, equity income associated with the equity interests sold by Adient and, therefore will not recur, equaled $155 million, including the equity income associated with the entities which Adient acquired controlling interests. Refer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nEquity income was $22 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $275 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease during fiscal 2020 was due primarily to the non-cash impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2020 of the YFAI investment as part of the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction ($231 million), and the impact from the planned divestiture of YFAI ($26 million), partially offset by higher income at certain China seating affiliates that included $10 million of benefits from tax credits at various China affiliates that are not expected to recur.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 36\nNet Financing Charge Table 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nSeptember 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net financing charges </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet financing charges increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of premium and related transaction costs paid on the repurchase of debt ($50 million), a write off of the associated deferred financing costs ($20 million), a derivative loss associated with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction ($30 million), and higher levels of outstanding debt and higher average interest rates during the current fiscal year. Net financing charges increased in fiscal 2020 as a result of higher levels of outstanding debt and to higher average interest rates in fiscal 2020, partially offset by $3 million of net gain resulting from the partial extinguishment of debt.

A pension mark-to-market gain ($15 million) occurred in fiscal 2021 compared to the $22 million mark-to-market charge in fiscal 2020. The decrease in pension expense in fiscal 2020 is due to the lower level of pension mark-to-market impact (a $22 million charge in fiscal 2020 compared to a $49 million charge in fiscal 2019), partially offset by a $2 million pension settlement expense related to the settlement of two plans in the United States.

In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. All of the factors that Adient considers in evaluating whether and when to establish or release all or a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance involve significant judgment. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary.\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2021 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in the Czech Republic, Korea, Mexico, and other jurisdictions would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $5 million, $5 million, $8 million, and $4 million, respectively, to establish valuation allowances. Adient continues to record valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and other jurisdictions as it remains more likely than not that they will not be realized.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 37\nThe fiscal 2020 income tax expense of $57 million was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, the repatriation of foreign earnings, and changes in uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the tax benefits related to the impairment and sale of Adient's YFAI investment, sale of Adient's automotive fabrics manufacturing business, and impairment charges recorded in the Asia segment.\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2020 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions would not be realized. These valuation allowances did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe fiscal 2019 income tax expense of $410 million was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the recognition of valuation allowances in Luxembourg, Poland, and the United Kingdom, repatriation of foreign earnings, changes in uncertain tax positions, and the impact of recognizing no tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances.\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2019 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence (including the external debt refinancing, the related incremental net financing costs, and the restructuring of the internal financing which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and including the long-lived asset impairment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2019), Adient determined it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets in Luxembourg (Q3), the United Kingdom (Q3) and certain Poland entities (Q2) would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $229 million, $25 million and $43 million, respectively, to establish valuation allowances.\nAdient is subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.S. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of Adient's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Adient's income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under audit by the respective tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities.

Resources\nAdient's primary liquidity needs are to fund general business requirements, including working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring costs and debt service requirements. Adient's principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, the revolving credit facility and other debt issuances, and existing cash balances. Adient actively manages its working capital and associated cash requirements and continually seeks more effective uses of cash. Working capital is highly influenced by the timing of cash flows associated with sales and purchases, and therefore can be difficult to manage at times.

Refer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" for more information on strategic transactions that have provided significant liquidity that will allow for additional voluntary debt pay down in fiscal 2022. Following the first quarter of fiscal 2019 dividend payout, Adient has suspended future dividends.\nIndebtedness\nAdient US LLC (\"Adient US\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Adient, together with certain of Adient's other subsidiaries, maintains an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility\u201d), which provides for a revolving line of credit up to $1,250 million, including a North American subfacility of up to $950 million and a European subfacility of up to $300 million, subject to borrowing base capacity. The ABL Credit Facility will mature on May 6, 2024, subject to a springing maturity date 91 days earlier if certain amounts remain outstanding at that time under the Term Loan B Agreement (defined below). Interest is payable on the ABL Credit Facility at a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00%. Adient will pay a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% on the unused portion of the commitments under the asset-based revolving credit facility based on average global availability. Letters of credit are limited to the lesser of (x) $150 million and (y) the aggregate unused amount of commitments under the ABL Credit Facility then in effect. Subject to certain conditions, the ABL Credit Facility may be expanded by up to $250 million in additional commitments. Loans under the ABL Credit Facility may be denominated, at the option of Adient, in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling or Swedish Kroner. The ABL Credit Agreement is secured on a first-priority lien on all accounts receivable, inventory and bank accounts (and funds on deposit therein) and a second-priority lien on all of the tangible and intangible assets of certain Adient subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2021, Adient had not drawn down on the ABL Credit Facility and had availability under this facility of $739 million (net of $59 million of letters of credit).\nIn addition, Adient US and Adient Global Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, maintain a term loan credit agreement (the Term Loan B Agreement\u201d) that initially provided for a 5-year $800 million senior secured term loan facility that was fully drawn on closing. The Term Loan B Agreement amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate of 1.00% per annum of the original principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance originally due at final maturity on May 6, 2024. Interest on the Term Loan B Agreement accrues at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin originally equal to 4.25% (with one 0.25% step down based on achievement of a specific secured net leverage level starting with the fiscal quarter ending\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 43\nDecember 31, 2019). The Term Loan B Agreement also permits Adient to incur incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $750 million and an unlimited amount subject to a pro forma first lien secured net leverage ratio of not greater than 1.75 to 1.00 and certain other conditions. In April 2021, Adient amended the Term Loan B Agreement (\"Amended Agreement\") which, among other changes (i) extended the maturity date for loans outstanding to April 8, 2028, (ii) reduced the interest rate margin applicable thereunder by 0.75% to 3.50%, in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans, and 2.50% (in the case of Base Rate loans) (in each case, with one 0.25% step down based on achievement of a specified first lien secured net leverage level starting with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021) and (iii) made certain other negative covenant and mandatory prepayment changes in connection therewith. The amendment also established incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $214 million resulting in total loans outstanding under the Amended Agreement of $1.0 billion. Adient paid $7 million related to the Amended Agreement and wrote off $8 million of previously deferred financing costs as a result of the debt extinguishment during the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nAdient US was also a party to an indenture relating to the issuance of $800 million aggregate principal amount of Senior First Lien Notes. The notes originally mature on May 15, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest on these notes was payable semi-annually in arrears on November 15 and May 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2019. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Adient repurchased $640 million of the outstanding balance of the Senior First Lien Notes at a price of 107% of the principal plus $17 million of accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, $9 million of previously deferred financing costs was written off to net financing charges. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, Adient redeemed the $160 million of remaining balance of the Senior First Lien Notes at a price of 103% of the principal plus $4 million of accrued and unpaid interest, and wrote off $3 million of previously deferred financing costs as a result of the debt extinguishment.\nThe ABL Credit Facility, Term Loan B Agreement and the Senior First Lien Notes due 2026 contain covenants that are usual and customary for facilities and debt instruments of this type and that, among other things, restrict the ability of Adient and its restricted subsidiaries to: create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee certain indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, Adient's capital stock or certain other debt; make other restricted payments; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of Adient's and its restricted subsidiaries' assets, to another person. These covenants are subject to a number of other limitations and exceptions set forth in the agreements. The agreements also provide for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, cross-default clauses with other debt arrangements, failure to pay principal and interest, failure to comply with covenants, agreements or conditions, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency involving Adient and its significant subsidiaries.\nAdient Global Holdings Ltd. ( AGH\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, maintains $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% USD-denominated unsecured notes due 2026. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient redeemed $103 million of face value of these notes, resulting in a remaining balance of $797 million as of September 30, 2020. Adient recorded a gain of $3 million associated with this partial redemption. AGH also maintains \u20ac1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024.\nAdient Germany Ltd. & Co. KG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adient, maintains \u20ac135 million in an unsecured term loan from the European Investment Bank ( EIB\u201d) due in 2022. The loan bears interest at the 6-month EURIBOR rate plus 158 basis points. Adient is compliant with the net leverage ratio at September 30, 2021 and expects to be compliant for the remainder of the term. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, Adient repaid $16 million of the EIB loan, triggered in part by the redemption of debt in the prior year. Adient repaid $20 million of the EIB loan in May 2021, triggered by the prior year sale of the fabrics business.\nOn April 20, 2020, Adient US offered $600 million (net proceeds of $591 million) aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025. These notes will mature on April 15, 2025, provided that if AGH has not refinanced (or otherwise redeemed) in whole its outstanding 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024 or any refinancing indebtedness thereof that matures earlier than 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Senior First Lien Notes due 2025 on or prior to May 15, 2024, these notes will mature on May 15, 2024. Interest on these notes is due on April 15 and October 15 each year, beginning on October 15, 2020. These notes contain covenants that are usual and customary, similar to the covenants on the Senior First Lien Notes due 2026 as described above. Adient incurred $10 million of debt issuance cost associated with this new debt in fiscal 2020.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 44\nSources of Cash Flows\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nSeptember 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided (used) by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>308 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided (used) by investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(383) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided (used) by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(770) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>303 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>(260) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(326) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(468) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities\nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: The increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to higher levels of operating profits, partially offset by unfavorable changes to working capital year-over-year driven by higher levels of inventory, higher levels of restructuring amounts paid and higher levels of interest paid in the current year.\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The decrease in operating cash flows is due primarily to lower levels of operating profits, partially offset by lower levels of trade working capital, specifically lower levels of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. See the working capital section below for further information on changes in working capital.\nCash flows from investing activities\nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: The increase in cash provided by investing activities is due to higher levels of proceeds received from business divestitures (primarily $715 million from the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction and $53 million from the sale of SJA) and lower levels of capital expenditures, partially offset by business acquisitions in the current year.\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures in the current year as well as $329 million of proceeds from the Yanfeng transaction and $170 million of net proceeds from the sale of the fabrics business, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of assets as compared to the prior year and a $37 million cash outflow as a result of the deconsolidation of the Adient Aerospace joint venture.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: The significant increase in cash used by financing activities is primarily due to the repayment of long-term debt, including premium paid, of $895 million, the prior year draw down of the ABL revolver of $179 million, and the $600 million of proceeds from the issuance of 9.00% Senior Notes in April 2020, partially offset by the $214 million incremental borrowing in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 under the amended Term Loan B Agreement.\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The increase in cash from financing activities is primarily attributable to the issuance of $600 million of debt in fiscal 2020 along with lower repayments of long-term debt.\nCapital expenditures\nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: Capital expenditures decreased year over year based on timing of program spend on product launches including certain launch delays in EMEA and tightening controls around overall spending.\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to decreased year over year spending based on timing of program spend on product launches and tightening controls around overall spending.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 45\nWorking capital\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,482 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>3,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>663 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in working capital of $912 million is primarily attributable to higher levels of inventory and other current assets (of which $643 million is attributable to the receivable related to the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction), lower levels of restructuring reserve, and other current liabilities, partially offset by lower levels of accounts receivable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAdient enters into supply chain financing programs in certain foreign jurisdictions to sell accounts receivable without recourse to third-party financial institutions. Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial position and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of September 30, 2021, $132 million has been funded under these programs.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of Adient's significant contractual obligations as of September 30, 2021:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023-2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025-2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>Beyond 2027 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>917 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td>369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension contributions </td> <td> </td> <td>131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,127 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes $67 million of committed capital expenditures.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe effects of inflation have historically not been significant to Adient's results of operations. Generally, Adient has been able to implement operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate. The automotive industry has recently experienced a period of sustained price increases for commodities such as steel and to a lesser extent petrochemicals, as well as higher freight costs, that may continue in the future as demand increases and supply may remain constrained which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nAdient prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following policies are considered by management\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 46\nto be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of Adient's consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nAdient records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Adient delivers products and records revenue pursuant to commercial agreements with its customers generally in the form of an approved purchase order, including the effects of contractual customer price productivity. Adient does negotiate discrete price changes with its customers, which are generally the result of unique commercial issues between Adient and its customers. Adient records amounts associated with discrete price changes as a reduction to revenue when specific facts and circumstances indicate that a price reduction is probable and the amounts are reasonably estimable. Adient records amounts associated with discrete price changes as an increase to revenue upon execution of a legally enforceable contractual agreement and when collectability is reasonably assured. Refer to Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" and Note 2, \"Revenue Recognition,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Other Long-lived Assets and Investments in Partially Owned Affiliates\nGoodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired. Adient reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. Adient performs impairment reviews for its reporting units, which have been determined to be Adient's reportable segments, using a fair value method based on management's judgments and assumptions or third-party valuations. The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In estimating the fair value, Adient uses the income approach in which discounted cash flow analyses are used to derive estimates of fair value of each reporting unit. Multiples of earnings based on the average of historical, published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics are also used in developing estimated fair values. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement.\" These calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions about market comparables, future cash flows and appropriate discount rates (based on weighted average cost of capital ranging from 15.0% - 17.5% at September 30, 2021) to reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows and to derive a reasonable enterprise value and related premium. The estimated future cash flows reflect management's latest assumptions of the financial projections based on current and anticipated competitive landscape, including estimates of revenue based on production volumes over the foreseeable future and long-term growth rates, and operating margins based on historical trends and future cost containment activities. The financial projections also considered the impact that COVID-19, operational interruptions due to semiconductor shortages and higher commodity and shipping costs are having on Adient's current and future operations as well as the impact to new vehicle sales in future years. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on the results of the goodwill impairment test and on Adient's results of operations. The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. Adient is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. As a result of the tests, there was no goodwill impairment recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Refer to Note 6, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAdient reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets with definite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Adient conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, \"Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\" ASC 360-10-15 requires Adient to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. Intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing as part of their asset group if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of an impairment within a separate China entity and as a result recorded a $5 million pre-tax non-cash impairment in the Asia segment related to long-lived assets due to an overall decline in the forecasted operations within that business. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment within the Futuris China business and as a result recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment of $27 million in the Asia segment, which consisted of customer relationship intangible assets of $24 million and other long-lived assets of $3 million, due to an\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 47\noverall decline in forecasted operations within that business. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Adient concluded it had triggering events requiring assessment of impairment of long-lived assets in the seat structure and mechanism operations. As a result, Adient reviewed the long-lived assets for impairment and recorded a $66 million impairment charge within restructuring and impairment costs on the consolidated statements of income (loss). The impairment charge related to long-lived assets in North America and Europe asset groups as of March 31, 2019 in support of current programs. No other long-lived asset impairments were identified in fiscal 2019. These impairments were measured, depending on the asset, either under an income approach utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows or a market approach utilizing appraisal techniques to determine fair values of the impaired assets. These methods are consistent with the methods Adient employed in prior periods to value other long-lived assets. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement\" and primarily consist of expected future operating margins and cash flows, estimated production volumes, weighted average cost of capital rates (13.0%), estimated salable values and third-party appraisal techniques such as market comparables. To the extent that profitability on current or future programs decline as compared to forecasted profitability or if adverse changes occur to key assumptions or other fair value measurement inputs, further impairment of long-lived assets could occur in the future. Refer to Note 16, \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAdient monitors its investments in partially-owned affiliates for indicators of other-than-temporary declines in value on an ongoing basis. If Adient determines that an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred, it recognizes an impairment loss, which is measured as the difference between the recorded book value and the fair value of the investment. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flows or negotiated transaction values. During fiscal 2020, Adient entered into an agreement to, among other things, transfer all of the issued and outstanding equity interest in YFAI held, directly or indirectly, by Adient, which represented 30% of YFAI's total issued and outstanding equity interest, to Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Company Ltd. for $369 million, of which $309 million was paid at closing and $60 million is to be paid on a deferred basis. This transaction closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Adient concluded that indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present in certain quarters during fiscal 2020 related to the investment in YFAI and recorded a total of $231 million non-cash impairment of Adient's YFAI investment within equity income. The impairments were determined based on combining the fair value of consideration received for all transactions contemplated within the Master Agreement, including an estimated fair value of the YFAS joint venture extension, and allocating the total consideration received to the individual transactions based on relative fair values. Adient estimated the fair value of the individual transactions using both an income approach and market approach. The inputs utilized in the fair value analyses of the transactions are classified as level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement\" and primarily consisted of expected future operating margins and cash flows of YFAI, estimated production volumes, estimated dividend payments from YFAS over the extension period, estimated terminal values of YFAS, market comparables, weighted-average costs of capital (YFAI - 15.0%, YFAS - 10.5%), and noncontrolling interest discounts. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d and Note 19, \"Nonconsolidated Partially-Owned Affiliates,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nAdient provides a range of pension benefits to its employees and retired employees. These benefits are Adient's direct obligation and have been recorded within Adient's consolidated financial statements. Plan assets and obligations are measured annually, or more frequently if there is a remeasurement event, based on Adient's measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date. Adient reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.\nAdient utilizes a mark-to-market approach for recognizing pension benefit expenses, including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event.\nU.S. GAAP requires that companies recognize in the statement of financial position a liability for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are underfunded or unfunded, or an asset for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are overfunded. U.S. GAAP also requires that companies measure the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets that determine a benefit plan's funded status as of the date of the employer's fiscal year end.\nAdient considers the expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis when setting assumed discount rates. As a result, Adient uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction, the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For the U.S. pension plans, Adient uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds. For the non-U.S. pension, Adient consistently uses the\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 48\nrelevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates. Adient's discount rate on U.S. pension plans was 3.06% and 2.91% at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Adient's weighted average discount rate on non-U.S. plans was 1.71% and 1.87% at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn estimating the expected return on plan assets, Adient considers the historical returns on plan assets, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans' invested assets. Reflecting the relatively long-term nature of the plans' obligations, approximately 60% of the plans' assets are invested in fixed income securities and 15% in equity securities, with the remainder primarily invested in alternative investments. For fiscal years 2021 and 2020, Adient's expected long-term return on U.S. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 5.75% and 5.75% respectively. The actual rate of return on U.S. pension plans was below 5.75% in fiscal 2021 and 2020. For fiscal years 2021 and 2020, Adient's weighted average expected long-term return on non-U.S. pension plan assets was 3.68% and 4.01%, respectively. The actual rate of return on non-U.S. pension plans was above 3.68% in fiscal 2021 and was above 4.01% in fiscal 2020.\nFor fiscal 2022, Adient estimates the long-term rate of return will approximate 5.75% and 3.20% for U.S. pension and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Any differences between actual investment results and the expected long-term asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. If Adient's actual returns on plan assets are less than Adient's expectations, additional contributions may be required.\nIn fiscal 2021, total Adient contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were $23 million. Adient expects to contribute at least $16 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2021, total Adient contributions to the postretirement plans were not significant.\nBased on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, Adient believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRefer to Note 14, \"Retirement Plans,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on Adient's pension plans.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Adient records a valuation allowance that primarily represents operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain. Management judgment is required in determining Adient's provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against Adient's net deferred tax assets.\nAdient reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary.\nAdient is subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.S. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of Adient's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Adient's income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under audit by the respective tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nAdient does not generally provide for additional income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. Adient's intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax efficient.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 49\nRefer to Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for Adient's income tax disclosures.\nRestructuring Costs\nAdient accrues costs in connection with its restructuring actions. These accruals include estimates primarily related to employee headcount, local statutory benefits, and other employee termination costs. Actual costs may vary from these estimates. These accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified. Refer to Note 15, Restructuring and Impairment Costs,\u201d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\nDuring fiscal 2021, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (\"2021 Plan\") of $27 million that was offset by $16 million of prior year underspend. Of the restructuring costs recorded, $23 million related to the EMEA segment, $3 million related to the Americas segment, and $1 million relates to the Asia segment. Adient currently estimates that upon completion of the restructuring actions, the fiscal 2021 restructuring plan will reduce annual operating costs by approximately $23 million, which is primarily the result of lower costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses due to reduced employee-related costs, of which approximately 25%-35% will result in net savings. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by fiscal 2022.\nDuring fiscal 2020, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (\"2020 Plan\") of $205 million. Of the restructuring costs recorded, $20 million relates to the Americas segment, $175 million relates to the EMEA segment and $10 million relates to the Asia segment. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions. Adient currently estimates that upon completion of the restructuring actions, the fiscal 2020 restructuring plan will reduce annual operating costs by approximately $180 million, which is primarily the result of lower costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses due to reduced employee-related costs, of which approximately 35%-40% will result in net savings. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by fiscal 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2019, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (\"2019 Plan\") of $105 million. Of the restructuring costs recorded, $81 million relates to the EMEA segment, $16 million relates to the Americas segment and $8 million relates to the Asia segment. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions. Also recorded in fiscal 2019 was $16 million of prior year underspend, a $9 million increase to a prior year reserve and $6 million of recoveries from a customer related to previous restructuring charges.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 50", "item_7_truncated": "Impairment of Goodwill, Other Long-lived Assets and Investments in Partially Owned Affiliates\nComprehensive income attributable to Adient was $1,146 million for fiscal 2021 compared to a comprehensive loss attributable to Adient of $643 million for fiscal 2020. The increased level of comprehensive income attributable to Adient in fiscal 2021 is primarily due to higher net income ($1,676 million), the favorable change in foreign currency translation adjustments ($85 million) and favorable change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives ($40 million), partially offset by the increase in comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($13 million).\nOn April 20, 2020, Adient US offered $600 million (net proceeds of $591 million) aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025. These notes will mature on April 15, 2025, provided that if AGH has not refinanced (or otherwise redeemed) in whole its outstanding 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024 or any refinancing indebtedness thereof that matures earlier than 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Senior First Lien Notes due 2025 on or prior to May 15, 2024, these notes will mature on May 15, 2024. Interest on these notes is due on April 15 and October 15 each year, beginning on October 15, 2020. These notes contain covenants that are usual and customary, similar to the covenants on the Senior First Lien Notes due 2026 as described above. Adient incurred $10 million of debt issuance cost associated with this new debt in fiscal 2020.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nSeptember 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income attributable to noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nSeptember 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,785 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td>5,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,675 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia </td> <td> </td> <td>2,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,337 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations </td> <td> </td> <td>(171) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(189) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(271) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,526 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdient evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using an adjusted EBITDA metric defined as income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, restructuring related-costs, net mark-to-market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans, transaction gains/losses, purchase accounting amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items (\"Adjusted EBITDA\").

See the working capital section below for further information on changes in working capital.\nDuring fiscal 2021, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (\"2021 Plan\") of $27 million that was offset by $16 million of prior year underspend. Of the restructuring costs recorded, $23 million related to the EMEA segment, $3 million related to the Americas segment, and $1 million relates to the Asia segment. Adient currently estimates that upon completion of the restructuring actions, the fiscal 2021 restructuring plan will reduce annual operating costs by approximately $23 million, which is primarily the result of lower costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses due to reduced employee-related costs, of which approximately 25%-35% will result in net savings. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by fiscal 2022.\nSee Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nRefer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the assets held for sale.

The significant increase during fiscal 2021 was due primarily to a one-time gain associated with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction ($1,181 million), one-time gain associated with the sale of Adient's interest in SJA ($33 million), a prior year non-cash impairment charge related to Adient's YFAI investment divestiture ($231 million), a one-time gain on previously held interest at YFAS in an affiliate during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 ($5 million), favorable impact of foreign currencies ($19 million), and prior year lower production volumes within Adient's China affiliates due to the impact of COVID-19 primarily during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 despite the current year operational interruptions and temporary production stoppages resulting from semiconductor chip shortages ($27 million).

The ABL Credit Facility will mature on May 6, 2024, subject to a springing maturity date 91 days earlier if certain amounts remain outstanding at that time under the Term Loan B Agreement (defined below). Interest is payable on the ABL Credit Facility at a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00%. Adient will pay a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% on the unused portion of the commitments under the asset-based revolving credit facility based on average global availability. Letters of credit are limited to the lesser of (x) $150 million and (y) the aggregate unused amount of commitments under the ABL Credit Facility then in effect. Subject to certain conditions, the ABL Credit Facility may be expanded by up to $250 million in additional commitments. Loans under the ABL Credit Facility may be denominated, at the option of Adient, in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling or Swedish Kroner. The ABL Credit Agreement is secured on a first-priority lien on all accounts receivable, inventory and bank accounts (and funds on deposit therein) and a second-priority lien on all of the tangible and intangible assets of certain Adient subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2021, Adient had not drawn down on the ABL Credit Facility and had availability under this facility of $739 million (net of $59 million of letters of credit).\n\nCost of sales increased by $776 million, or 6% and gross profit increased by $234 million, or 40%, in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The cost of sales year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in all regions ($507 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($258 million), higher commodity costs ($150 million), temporary operational inefficiencies including premium freight and unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages and to a lesser extent COVID-19 related costs ($165 million) and prior year non-recurring favorable benefits related to actions taken as described in the On-Going Impact of COVID-19 section above ($36 million), partially offset by the impact of prior year divestitures primarily consisting of the RECARO and fabrics businesses ($120 million), overall operational performance improvements ($106 million), favorable material margins ($76 million), and a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits ($38 million). The increase in gross profit was due to higher overall volumes, the favorable impact of foreign currencies, operational performance improvements, the favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments, including material economics, and the one-time gain in Brazil, partially offset by higher commodity costs, inefficiencies caused by unplanned production stoppages and certain prior year incentive compensation costs and to a lesser extent other benefits that were not expected to recur. Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment profitability.\nAdient Global Holdings Ltd. ( AGH\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, maintains $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% USD-denominated unsecured notes due 2026. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient redeemed $103 million of face value of these notes, resulting in a remaining balance of $797 million as of September 30, 2020. Adient recorded a gain of $3 million associated with this partial redemption. AGH also maintains \u20ac1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024.\nAlthough the global automotive industry experienced increased demand for new vehicles as Adient emerged from the global shutdowns in late fiscal year 2020 and early fiscal year 2021, it is possible that, in the event of the resurgence of COVID-19, the global automotive industry will experience significantly lower demand for new vehicle sales over the long-term as a result of the global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic because new vehicle sales are highly dependent on strong consumer confidence and low unemployment. As a result, new vehicle sales could be significantly lower than historical and previously projected pre-pandemic sales levels.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nSeptember 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,337 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>513 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nSeptember 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>275 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdient conducts its business globally in the automotive industry, which is highly competitive and sensitive to economic, political and social factors in the various regions.

The decrease in pension expense in fiscal 2020 is due to the lower level of pension mark-to-market impact (a $22 million charge in fiscal 2020 compared to a $49 million charge in fiscal 2019), partially offset by a $2 million pension settlement expense related to the settlement of two plans in the United States.

The increased net income attributable to Adient is due to $1,214 million of one-time gains from sales of certain of Adient's equity interests in China, higher current year volumes primarily resulting from prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, current year operational improvements, lower restructuring charges, a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits, and a $231 million prior year non-cash impairment of the YFAI investment, partially offset by operational inefficiencies and premium freight caused by unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages, higher net financing charges, and higher income tax expense primarily resulting from the withholding taxes paid in association with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nSeptember 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Adient </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(643) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(529) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes $67 million of committed capital expenditures.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 30\nThe impact of COVID-19, and related mutations, continues to be present throughout the world, including in all global and regional markets served by Adient. Although vaccines have been introduced that are expected to have the result of reducing the effect of COVID-19 and COVID-19 started to wane in certain geographic areas, governmental authorities continue to implement numerous measures attempting to contain and mitigate the effects of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, social distancing orders, shelter in place orders and shutdowns of non-essential activities. Adient's manufacturing facilities are located in areas that continue to be affected by the pandemic.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 43\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nDuring fiscal 2019, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (\"2019 Plan\") of $105 million. Of the restructuring costs recorded, $81 million relates to the EMEA segment, $16 million relates to the Americas segment and $8 million relates to the Asia segment. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions. Also recorded in fiscal 2019 was $16 million of prior year underspend, a $9 million increase to a prior year reserve and $6 million of recoveries from a customer related to previous restructuring charges.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 29\nNet Sales \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nAdient prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following policies are considered by management\nThe fiscal 2021 income tax expense of $249 million was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, the establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, and the repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by tax benefits from audit settlements, the write-off of deferred tax liabilities related to withholding taxes, and withholding taxes on the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction at a rate lower than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5%.\nAdient designs, manufactures and markets a full range of seating systems and components for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and light trucks, including vans, pick-up trucks and sport/crossover utility vehicles. Adient operates in 208 wholly- and\nThe increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2021 is attributable to higher income resulting from higher volumes in the current year, attributable primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at certain Seating affiliates in varying jurisdictions during the prior year. The decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to lower income resulting from lower volumes, as a result of the COVID-19 impact at certain Seating affiliates in varying jurisdictions during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased by $113 million, or 17%, in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. SG&A was favorably impacted by lower overall administrative and engineering spending ($88 million), including lower levels of certain compensation and discretionary spending which are not expected to recur as part of the annual SG&A run rate, prior year Adient Aerospace and RECARO costs ($39 million), lower share based compensation expense ($5 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency ($5 million), partially offset by higher transaction costs in the current year related to the Yanfeng transaction and sale of the fabrics business ($12 million). Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment profitability.\nAs previously disclosed, beginning at the end of January 2020 and continuing through June 2020, Adient experienced the shutdown of its facilities in all geographic regions (Asia, Americas and EMEA) at various points in time. Production finally started to resume in all regions and continued to ramp up through Adient's fiscal fourth quarter, and as of December 31, 2020, virtually all of Adient's plants had resumed production.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 31\nNet sales increased by $1,010 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the prior year significant operational interruptions related to COVID-19 starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 which resulted in lower sales volumes across all regions and despite current year certain unplanned temporary production stoppages primarily resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages ($786 million), favorable foreign currency impact ($273 million), favorable material economics recoveries ($83 million), and favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments, partially offset by the impact of divestitures primarily related to RECARO and fabrics businesses ($156 million). Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment net sales.\nThe ABL Credit Facility, Term Loan B Agreement and the Senior First Lien Notes due 2026 contain covenants that are usual and customary for facilities and debt instruments of this type and that, among other things, restrict the ability of Adient and its restricted subsidiaries to: create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee certain indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, Adient's capital stock or certain other debt; make other restricted payments; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of Adient's and its restricted subsidiaries' assets, to another person. These covenants are subject to a number of other limitations and exceptions set forth in the agreements. The agreements also provide for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, cross-default clauses with other debt arrangements, failure to pay principal and interest, failure to comply with covenants, agreements or conditions, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency involving Adient and its significant subsidiaries.\nOverview\nAsia\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 33\nThe fiscal 2020 income tax expense of $57 million was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, the repatriation of foreign earnings, and changes in uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the tax benefits related to the impairment and sale of Adient's YFAI investment, sale of Adient's automotive fabrics manufacturing business, and impairment charges recorded in the Asia segment.\n(7) The year ended September 30, 2021 reflects a one-time gain of $38 million associated with the retrospective recovery of indirect tax credits in Brazil resulting from a favorable court ruling (of which $36 million relates to recoveries covering the past 20 years and is adjusted out of Americas' segment results), a $5 million gain on previously held interest at YFAS in an affiliate, and $19 million of transaction costs. The year ended September 30, 2020 includes $15 million of transaction costs and $1 million of tax adjustments at YFAI. The year ended September 30, 2019 includes $4 million of integration costs associated with the acquisition of Futuris, $3 million of transaction costs and $2 million of tax adjustments at YFAI.\nSeparation from the former Parent\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures in the current year as well as $329 million of proceeds from the Yanfeng transaction and $170 million of net proceeds from the sale of the fabrics business, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of assets as compared to the prior year and a $37 million cash outflow as a result of the deconsolidation of the Adient Aerospace joint venture.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to decreased year over year spending based on timing of program spend on product launches and tightening controls around overall spending.\nAdient enters into supply chain financing programs in certain foreign jurisdictions to sell accounts receivable without recourse to third-party financial institutions. Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial position and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of September 30, 2021, $132 million has been funded under these programs.\nEquity income was $22 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $275 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease during fiscal 2020 was due primarily to the non-cash impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2020 of the YFAI investment as part of the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction ($231 million), and the impact from the planned divestiture of YFAI ($26 million), partially offset by higher income at certain China seating affiliates that included $10 million of benefits from tax credits at various China affiliates that are not expected to recur.\nAdient does not generally provide for additional income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. Adient's intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax efficient.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 37\nAdient's primary liquidity needs are to fund general business requirements, including working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring costs and debt service requirements. Adient's principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, the revolving credit facility and other debt issuances, and existing cash balances. Adient actively manages its working capital and associated cash requirements and continually seeks more effective uses of cash. Working capital is highly influenced by the timing of cash flows associated with sales and purchases, and therefore can be difficult to manage at times. See below and refer to Note 9, \"Debt and Financing Arrangements,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of financing arrangements. Refer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" for more information on strategic transactions that have provided significant liquidity that will allow for additional voluntary debt pay down in fiscal 2022. Following the first quarter of fiscal 2019 dividend payout, Adient has suspended future dividends.\n\u2022Adient recorded net sales of $13,680 million for fiscal 2021, representing an increase of $1,010 million when compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales is attributable to prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, the favorable impact of foreign currencies and favorable material economics recoveries, partially offset by current year temporary operational interruptions and production stoppages primarily resulting from semiconductor chip shortages, and prior year divestitures primarily consisting of the fabrics businesses, and unfavorable commercial settlements.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 35\nNet sales decreased by $3,856 million, or 23%, in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the significant operational interruptions related to COVID-19 starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 which resulted in lower sales volumes across all regions, unfavorable foreign currency impact ($217 million), and the impact of divestitures primarily related to RECARO ($115 million), partially offset by favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments, including material economics, net of recoveries. Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment net sales.\n\nNet financing charges increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of premium and related transaction costs paid on the repurchase of debt ($50 million), a write off of the associated deferred financing costs ($20 million), a derivative loss associated with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction ($30 million), and higher levels of outstanding debt and higher average interest rates during the current fiscal year. Net financing charges increased in fiscal 2020 as a result of higher levels of outstanding debt and to higher average interest rates in fiscal 2020, partially offset by $3 million of net gain resulting from the partial extinguishment of debt. Refer to Note 9, \"Debt and Financing Arrangements,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the components of Adient's net financing charges.\nAdient monitors its investments in partially-owned affiliates for indicators of other-than-temporary declines in value on an ongoing basis. If Adient determines that an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred, it recognizes an impairment loss, which is measured as the difference between the recorded book value and the fair value of the investment. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flows or negotiated transaction values. During fiscal 2020, Adient entered into an agreement to, among other things, transfer all of the issued and outstanding equity interest in YFAI held, directly or indirectly, by Adient, which represented 30% of YFAI's total issued and outstanding equity interest, to Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Company Ltd. for $369 million, of which $309 million was paid at closing and $60 million is to be paid on a deferred basis. This transaction closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Adient concluded that indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present in certain quarters during fiscal 2020 related to the investment in YFAI and recorded a total of $231 million non-cash impairment of Adient's YFAI investment within equity income. The impairments were determined based on combining the fair value of consideration received for all transactions contemplated within the Master Agreement, including an estimated fair value of the YFAS joint venture extension, and allocating the total consideration received to the individual transactions based on relative fair values. Adient estimated the fair value of the individual transactions using both an income approach and market approach. The inputs utilized in the fair value analyses of the transactions are classified as level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement\" and primarily consisted of expected future operating margins and cash flows of YFAI, estimated production volumes, estimated dividend payments from YFAS over the extension period, estimated terminal values of YFAS, market comparables, weighted-average costs of capital (YFAI - 15.0%, YFAS - 10.5%), and noncontrolling interest discounts. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d and Note 19, \"Nonconsolidated Partially-Owned Affiliates,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe automotive production shutdown in fiscal 2020 also significantly impacted Adient's daily working capital. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient experienced significantly lower trade working capital balances (accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable) due to the shutdown of production in the early part of the third quarter and resumption of production only toward the latter part of the quarter. Trade working capital was favorably impacted during the early part of the third quarter but was more than offset by the unfavorable impact to trade working capital during the latter part of the quarter. The resumption of production in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 had a favorable impact to trade working capital as Adient returned to a more stabilized production run rate.\nCost of Sales / Gross Profit\nComprehensive Income Attributable to Adient\noverall decline in forecasted operations within that business. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Adient concluded it had triggering events requiring assessment of impairment of long-lived assets in the seat structure and mechanism operations. As a result, Adient reviewed the long-lived assets for impairment and recorded a $66 million impairment charge within restructuring and impairment costs on the consolidated statements of income (loss). The impairment charge related to long-lived assets in North America and Europe asset groups as of March 31, 2019 in support of current programs. No other long-lived asset impairments were identified in fiscal 2019. These impairments were measured, depending on the asset, either under an income approach utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows or a market approach utilizing appraisal techniques to determine fair values of the impaired assets. These methods are consistent with the methods Adient employed in prior periods to value other long-lived assets. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement\" and primarily consist of expected future operating margins and cash flows, estimated production volumes, weighted average cost of capital rates (13.0%), estimated salable values and third-party appraisal techniques such as market comparables. To the extent that profitability on current or future programs decline as compared to forecasted profitability or if adverse changes occur to key assumptions or other fair value measurement inputs, further impairment of long-lived assets could occur in the future. Refer to Note 16, \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nNet sales increased during fiscal 2021 by $416 million as a result of prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19 and despite certain unplanned temporary production stoppages in the current year primarily resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages ($254 million), the favorable impact of foreign currency ($234 million), the favorable impact of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($22 million), and the favorable impact of material economics recoveries ($50 million), partially offset by the impact of prior year divestitures primarily consisting of the RECARO and fabrics businesses ($144 million).\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The increase in cash from financing activities is primarily attributable to the issuance of $600 million of debt in fiscal 2020 along with lower repayments of long-term debt.\n(2) Reflects restructuring charges for costs that are directly attributable to restructuring activities and meet the definition of restructuring under ASC 420 and non-recurring impairment charges. Included in restructuring charges in fiscal 2021 is a $9 million held for sale non-cash impairment charge in EMEA, and a $1 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets in EMEA. Included in restructuring charges in fiscal 2020 is a non-cash pre-tax impairment related to China intangible assets of $24 million, held for sale asset impairments of $21 million, and $8 million of other long-lived asset impairments. Included in restructuring charges in fiscal 2019 is a $66 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets ($11 million in the Americas and $55 million in EMEA) and an $18 million non-cash impairment charge related to assets held for sale ($6 million in the Americas and $12 million in Asia). Refer to Note 6, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" Note 15, \"Restructuring and Impairment Costs,\" and Note 16, \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nCash flows from operating activities\nThe fiscal 2019 income tax expense of $410 million was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the recognition of valuation allowances in Luxembourg, Poland, and the United Kingdom, repatriation of foreign earnings, changes in uncertain tax positions, and the impact of recognizing no tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances.\nAdient accrues costs in connection with its restructuring actions. These accruals include estimates primarily related to employee headcount, local statutory benefits, and other employee termination costs. Actual costs may vary from these estimates. These accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified. Refer to Note 15, Restructuring and Impairment Costs,\u201d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2019 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence (including the external debt refinancing, the related incremental net financing costs, and the restructuring of the internal financing which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and including the long-lived asset impairment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2019), Adient determined it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets in Luxembourg (Q3), the United Kingdom (Q3) and certain Poland entities (Q2) would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $229 million, $25 million and $43 million, respectively, to establish valuation allowances.\nGlobal Automotive Industry\nmajority-owned manufacturing or assembly facilities, with operations in 33 countries. Additionally, Adient has partially-owned affiliates in China, Asia, Europe and North America. Through its global footprint and vertical integration, Adient leverages its capabilities to drive growth in the automotive seating industry.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 44\nIndebtedness\nLight vehicle production levels by geographic region are provided below:\n\n($3 million), and the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($29 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of material economics, net of recoveries ($9 million), unfavorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($21 million), the impact of current year divestiture of SJA ($9 million), the impact of prior year divestiture of YFAI ($18 million) and RECARO ($5 million), prior year tax benefits at various affiliates that were not expected to recur ($10 million), higher administrative expense due in part to prior year benefits that were not expected to recur ($9 million), and operational inefficiencies including premium freight and unplanned temporary production stoppages resulting from semiconductor shortages and to a lesser extent COVID-19 related costs ($6 million).\n(6) The year ended September 30, 2021 includes a gain associated with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction of $1,181 million and a gain of $33 million on the sale of Adient's interest in SJA. The year ended September 30, 2020 includes non-cash impairment charges related to Adient's YFAI investment balance recorded in conjunction with the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction. All of these impacts have been recorded within the equity income line in the consolidated statements of income.\nIn fiscal 2021, total Adient contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were $23 million. Adient expects to contribute at least $16 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2021, total Adient contributions to the postretirement plans were not significant.\nAdient Germany Ltd. & Co. KG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adient, maintains \u20ac135 million in an unsecured term loan from the European Investment Bank ( EIB\u201d) due in 2022. The loan bears interest at the 6-month EURIBOR rate plus 158 basis points. Adient is compliant with the net leverage ratio at September 30, 2021 and expects to be compliant for the remainder of the term. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, Adient repaid $16 million of the EIB loan, triggered in part by the redemption of debt in the prior year. Adient repaid $20 million of the EIB loan in May 2021, triggered by the prior year sale of the fabrics business.\nAdient is subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.S. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of Adient's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Adient's income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under audit by the respective tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nContractual Obligations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nDecember 31, 2019). The Term Loan B Agreement also permits Adient to incur incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $750 million and an unlimited amount subject to a pro forma first lien secured net leverage ratio of not greater than 1.75 to 1.00 and certain other conditions. In April 2021, Adient amended the Term Loan B Agreement (\"Amended Agreement\") which, among other changes (i) extended the maturity date for loans outstanding to April 8, 2028, (ii) reduced the interest rate margin applicable thereunder by 0.75% to 3.50%, in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans, and 2.50% (in the case of Base Rate loans) (in each case, with one 0.25% step down based on achievement of a specified first lien secured net leverage level starting with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021) and (iii) made certain other negative covenant and mandatory prepayment changes in connection therewith. The amendment also established incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $214 million resulting in total loans outstanding under the Amended Agreement of $1.0 billion. Adient paid $7 million related to the Amended Agreement and wrote off $8 million of previously deferred financing costs as a result of the debt extinguishment during the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased during fiscal 2021 by $4 million due primarily to higher current year volumes as explained above and product mix ($120 million), operational performance improvements ($3 million), the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($8 million), and favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($70 million), partially offset by operational inefficiencies including premium freight and unplanned temporary production stoppages in the current year resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages and to a lesser extent COVID-19 related costs ($104 million), higher administrative expense primarily related to certain prior year benefits related costs that were not expected to recur, net of current year efficiency improvements ($44 million), the unfavorable material economics, net of recoveries ($46 million), and lower equity income ($3 million).\nIn estimating the expected return on plan assets, Adient considers the historical returns on plan assets, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans' invested assets. Reflecting the relatively long-term nature of the plans' obligations, approximately 60% of the plans' assets are invested in fixed income securities and 15% in equity securities, with the remainder primarily invested in alternative investments. For fiscal years 2021 and 2020, Adient's expected long-term return on U.S. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 5.75% and 5.75% respectively. The actual rate of return on U.S. pension plans was below 5.75% in fiscal 2021 and 2020. For fiscal years 2021 and 2020, Adient's weighted average expected long-term return on non-U.S. pension plan assets was 3.68% and 4.01%, respectively. The actual rate of return on non-U.S. pension plans was above 3.68% in fiscal 2021 and was above 4.01% in fiscal 2020.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken to restrain the spread of the virus have had, and may continue to have, a material negative impact on Adient's financial results and liquidity, and such negative impact may continue well beyond the containment of COVID-19 through the results of widespread use of the vaccine or otherwise. Adient cannot assure that the assumptions used to estimate its liquidity requirements will be correct because it has never previously experienced such a widespread cessation of its operations as it experienced during fiscal year 2020, and it is unclear what the lasting impacts of the slowdown in the automotive industry will be. In addition, the magnitude, duration, speed and potential resurgence or surges of the global pandemic are all uncertain. Consequently, the impact of the pandemic and its myriad of effects on Adient's business, financial condition or longer-term financial or operational results remain uncertain. Based on the actions it has taken and its current assumptions regarding the impact of COVID-19, Adient believes that its current financial resources will be sufficient to fund the company's liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.\n\u2022Equity income was $1,484 million for fiscal 2021, which compares to equity income of $22 million for fiscal 2020. The significant increase is primarily attributable to a $1,181 million current year gain recognized upon sales of certain of Adient's equity interests in China as part of the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction and $33 million current year gain on the sale of SJA, favorable impact of foreign currencies, a $231 million prior year non-cash impairment of the YFAI investment as part of the 2020 Yanfeng transaction, and operational performance improvements primarily at Adient's affiliates in China. Excluding the impacts of current year transactional gains and prior year impairments, equity income increased by $17 million.\nAdient is subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.S. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of Adient's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Adient's income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under audit by the respective tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 50\nAdient reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary.\nSources of Cash Flows\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 32\nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: The increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to higher levels of operating profits, partially offset by unfavorable changes to working capital year-over-year driven by higher levels of inventory, higher levels of restructuring amounts paid and higher levels of interest paid in the current year.\n\n(1) Corporate-related costs not allocated to the segments include executive office, communications, corporate development, legal and corporate finance.\nAdient utilizes a mark-to-market approach for recognizing pension benefit expenses, including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event.\n\nAdient reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets with definite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Adient conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, \"Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\" ASC 360-10-15 requires Adient to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. Intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing as part of their asset group if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of an impairment within a separate China entity and as a result recorded a $5 million pre-tax non-cash impairment in the Asia segment related to long-lived assets due to an overall decline in the forecasted operations within that business. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment within the Futuris China business and as a result recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment of $27 million in the Asia segment, which consisted of customer relationship intangible assets of $24 million and other long-lived assets of $3 million, due to an\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 34\nThe global automotive industry continues to experience widespread supply chain disruptions primarily related to semiconductor chip shortages. Although Adient's seating products are not highly dependent on semiconductor chips, Adient is directly impacted by the lower production levels at the OEM's as a result of these supply disruptions. These disruptions have led to unplanned downtime at Adient's production facilities, often with very little warning, which results in operating inefficiencies and limits Adient's ability to adequately mitigate such inefficiencies. The automotive industry has also experienced a period of sustained price increases for commodities, primarily related to steel, and to a lesser extent petrochemicals. Shipping costs have also sharply increased throughout the fiscal year. These commodity and shipping cost increases may continue into the future as demand increases and supply may remain constrained, which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset. Adient is also closely monitoring labor availability and wage inflationary pressures, both internally and at key vendors, to assess any impact labor shortages and wage inflation might have on Adient's ability to perform its obligations. Although Adient has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, commodity and shipping costs, these strategies (which include targeted SG&A savings through hiring freezes, delayed merit increases, suspended 401(k) matches in the U.S. and RSU replacement awards in lieu of salary for certain executives of Adient), together with commercial negotiations with Adient's customers and suppliers, are only expected to offset a portion of the adverse impact. Refer to the consolidated results of operations and segment analysis discussion below for additional information on the impacts of these items on Adient's results. Also refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors section for additional information.\nSignificant aspects of Adient's financial results for fiscal 2021 include the items discussed below. The recently completed transactions in China had a significant impact on the fiscal 2021 financial results. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on these transactions.\nAdient considers the expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis when setting assumed discount rates. As a result, Adient uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction, the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For the U.S. pension plans, Adient uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds. For the non-U.S. pension, Adient consistently uses the\nIncome Tax Provision\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2020 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions would not be realized. These valuation allowances did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring fiscal 2020, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (\"2020 Plan\") of $205 million. Of the restructuring costs recorded, $20 million relates to the Americas segment, $175 million relates to the EMEA segment and $10 million relates to the Asia segment. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions. Adient currently estimates that upon completion of the restructuring actions, the fiscal 2020 restructuring plan will reduce annual operating costs by approximately $180 million, which is primarily the result of lower costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses due to reduced employee-related costs, of which approximately 35%-40% will result in net savings. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by fiscal 2024.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 48\nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: The increase in cash provided by investing activities is due to higher levels of proceeds received from business divestitures (primarily $715 million from the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction and $53 million from the sale of SJA) and lower levels of capital expenditures, partially offset by business acquisitions in the current year.\n\nrelevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates. Adient's discount rate on U.S. pension plans was 3.06% and 2.91% at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Adient's weighted average discount rate on non-U.S. plans was 1.71% and 1.87% at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 38\nThe effects of inflation have historically not been significant to Adient's results of operations. Generally, Adient has been able to implement operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate. The automotive industry has recently experienced a period of sustained price increases for commodities such as steel and to a lesser extent petrochemicals, as well as higher freight costs, that may continue in the future as demand increases and supply may remain constrained which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 40\nFinancial Results Summary\nEMEA \n\nAdient manages its business on a geographic basis and operates in the following three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; 2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\") and 3) Asia Pacific/China (\"Asia\").\nPresentation of Information\nAdient is a global leader in the automotive seating supply industry with relationships with the largest global auto manufacturers. Adient's technologies extend into virtually every area of automotive seating solutions, including complete seating systems, frames, mechanisms, foam, head restraints, armrests and trim covers. Adient is an independent seat supplier with global scale and the capability to design, develop, engineer, manufacture and deliver complete seat systems and components in every major automotive producing region in the world.\nCash flows from financing activities\nUnless the context requires otherwise, references to \"Adient plc\" or \"Adient\" refer to Adient plc and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods subsequent to its separation from Johnson Controls International plc (\"the former Parent\") on October 31, 2016. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the \"separation\" refer to the legal separation and transfer of the former Parent's automotive seating and interiors business to Adient on October 31, 2016. The information presented herein are based on management's perspective of Adient's results of operations.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Adient\nOther Pension Expense (Income) \nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2021 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in the Czech Republic, Korea, Mexico, and other jurisdictions would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $5 million, $5 million, $8 million, and $4 million, respectively, to establish valuation allowances. Adient continues to record valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and other jurisdictions as it remains more likely than not that they will not be realized.\nFor fiscal 2022, Adient estimates the long-term rate of return will approximate 5.75% and 3.20% for U.S. pension and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Any differences between actual investment results and the expected long-term asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. If Adient's actual returns on plan assets are less than Adient's expectations, additional contributions may be required.\nNet sales decreased during fiscal 2020 by $1,896 million due to lower production volumes ($1,787 million) resulting primarily from the operational shutdowns during fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as $55 million attributable to the GM labor strike during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and the impact of Adient specific launches, along with the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($75 million), the unfavorable impact of material economics ($21 million), and the unfavorable impact of the RECARO divestiture ($39 million), partially offset by the favorable impact of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($26 million).\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased during fiscal 2020 by $60 million due to lower volumes ($243 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($12 million), unfavorable material economics, net of recovery ($10 million), and lower equity income ($3 million), partially offset by operational performance improvements ($91 million), lower administrative and engineering expense ($56 million) including lower levels of certain compensation and discretionary spending which are not expected to recur as part of the annual run rate, favorable net material and pricing adjustments ($57 million), and the favorable impact of divestitures primarily related to RECARO ($4 million).\nComprehensive loss attributable to Adient was $643 million for fiscal 2020 compared to comprehensive loss attributable to Adient for fiscal 2019 of $529 million. This increased level of comprehensive loss attributable to Adient in fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of higher levels of net loss ($56 million), the unfavorable impact in foreign currency transaction adjustments resulting from overall weakening of emerging market currencies, partially offset by the strengthening of the Chinese yuan ($34 million), and the unfavorable impact in realized and unrealized losses on derivatives ($19 million), partially offset by the decrease in comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($15 million).\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Adient records a valuation allowance that primarily represents operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain. Management judgment is required in determining Adient's provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against Adient's net deferred tax assets.\nThe increase in working capital of $912 million is primarily attributable to higher levels of inventory and other current assets (of which $643 million is attributable to the receivable related to the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction), lower levels of restructuring reserve, and other current liabilities, partially offset by lower levels of accounts receivable.\nRevenue Recognition\nCapital expenditures\nRefer to Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for Adient's income tax disclosures.\nU.S. GAAP requires that companies recognize in the statement of financial position a liability for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are underfunded or unfunded, or an asset for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are overfunded. U.S. GAAP also requires that companies measure the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets that determine a benefit plan's funded status as of the date of the employer's fiscal year end.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 36\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased during fiscal 2020 by $89 million due to the impact of lower production volumes ($73 million), the unfavorable impact of the planned YFAI divestiture ($26 million), unfavorable material economics, net of recoveries ($3 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($12 million), the unfavorable impact of the RECARO divestiture ($9 million), and higher administrative and engineering costs ($2 million), partially offset by operational performance improvements ($8 million), higher equity income from China seating affiliates that included $10 million of benefits from tax credits at various China affiliates that are not expected to recur ($16 million), and favorable net material and pricing adjustments ($12 million).\n(5) The year ended September 30, 2021 includes a $21 million loss associated with certain aspects of the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction and a $5 million loss on sale of non-core assets in China. The year ended September 30, 2020 includes a $21 million loss of sale of RECARO and $4 million loss on deconsolidation of Aerospace, partially offset by a $12 million gain on completion of the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction.\nCost of sales decreased by $3,647 million, or 23%, and gross profit decreased by $209 million, or 26%, in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. Cost of sales were lower primarily due to the decrease in sales volumes as a result of the COVID-19 impact along with overall business performance improvements, the favorable impact of foreign currency ($195 million), and the impact of divestitures primarily related to RECARO ($97 million). Gross profit was lower as a result of the negative impact of lower sales volume due to the COVID-19 impact, partially offset by the impact of business performance improvements including lower launch inefficiencies, and reductions in operational waste and freight along with favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments. Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment profitability.\nNet sales increased during fiscal 2021 by $275 million as a result of prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19 and despite certain unplanned temporary production stoppages in the current year primarily resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages ($262 million), favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($33 million), and the favorable impact of material economics recoveries ($24 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($34 million), and the impact of the prior year divestiture of RECARO ($10 million).\nAdient provides a range of pension benefits to its employees and retired employees. These benefits are Adient's direct obligation and have been recorded within Adient's consolidated financial statements. Plan assets and obligations are measured annually, or more frequently if there is a remeasurement event, based on Adient's measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date. Adient reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 45\n\nAdient manages its business on a geographic basis and operates in the following three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; 2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\") and 3) Asia Pacific/China (\"Asia\").\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 46\nGoodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired. Adient reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. Adient performs impairment reviews for its reporting units, which have been determined to be Adient's reportable segments, using a fair value method based on management's judgments and assumptions or third-party valuations. The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In estimating the fair value, Adient uses the income approach in which discounted cash flow analyses are used to derive estimates of fair value of each reporting unit. Multiples of earnings based on the average of historical, published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics are also used in developing estimated fair values. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement.\" These calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions about market comparables, future cash flows and appropriate discount rates (based on weighted average cost of capital ranging from 15.0% - 17.5% at September 30, 2021) to reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows and to derive a reasonable enterprise value and related premium. The estimated future cash flows reflect management's latest assumptions of the financial projections based on current and anticipated competitive landscape, including estimates of revenue based on production volumes over the foreseeable future and long-term growth rates, and operating margins based on historical trends and future cost containment activities. The financial projections also considered the impact that COVID-19, operational interruptions due to semiconductor shortages and higher commodity and shipping costs are having on Adient's current and future operations as well as the impact to new vehicle sales in future years. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on the results of the goodwill impairment test and on Adient's results of operations. The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. Adient is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. As a result of the tests, there was no goodwill impairment recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Refer to Note 6, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\u2022Gross profit was $826 million, or 6.0% of net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to $592 million, or 4.7% of net sales for fiscal 2020. Profitability, including gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was higher due to higher current year volumes primarily resulting from prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, current year operational improvements, a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits, the favorable impact of foreign currencies, and favorable commercial settlements, partially offset by temporary operational inefficiencies and premium freight caused by unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor chip shortages, and unfavorable impacts of material economics, net of recoveries.\nNet Financing Charge \nAdient evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using an adjusted EBITDA metric defined as income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, restructuring related-costs, net mark-to-market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans, transaction gains/losses, purchase accounting amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"). Also, certain corporate-related costs are not allocated to the segments. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets served by Adient and reflect the financial information that is reviewed by its chief operating decision maker. Refer to Note 18, \"Segment Information,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on Adient's reportable segments.\nRestructuring and impairment costs were lower by $217 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to higher levels of restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2020 after the industry experienced significant volume decreases resulting from the COVID-19 impact, and $53 million of one-time non-cash impairment charges in the prior year of long-lived assets in China and other assets held for sale.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 39\nAdient reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. All of the factors that Adient considers in evaluating whether and when to establish or release all or a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance involve significant judgment. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased during fiscal 2021 by $62 million due primarily to higher current year volumes as explained above ($50 million), higher equity income as a result of the prior year operational interruptions at Adient's China affiliates due to COVID-19 ($34 million), operational performance improvements ($33 million), lower administrative and engineering expense\n\ncertain corporate-related costs are not allocated to the segments. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets served by Adient and reflect the financial information that is reviewed by its chief operating decision maker.\nRestructuring Costs\n(3) Reflects amortization of intangible assets including those related to partially owned affiliates recorded within equity income.\nNet sales decreased during the fiscal 2020 by $515 million due to lower production volumes ($474 million) primarily resulting from the operational shutdowns in China and in other Asia countries in fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the unfavorable impact of the RECARO divestiture ($37 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($13 million), and the unfavorable impact of material economics ($3 million), partially offset by the favorable impact of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($12 million).\n\nRefer to Note 14, \"Retirement Plans,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on Adient's pension plans.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 41\nSupply Chain Disruptions and Inflationary Pressures\nIncome Taxes\n\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 47\nAdjusted EBITDA increased during fiscal 2020 by $18 million due to the impact of operational performance improvements ($104 million), lower administrative and engineering expense ($100 million) including lower levels of certain compensation and discretionary spending which are not expected to recur as part of the annual run rate, the favorable impact of Adient Aerospace deconsolidation and RECARO divestiture ($25 million), the favorable impact of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($55 million) and favorable material economics, net of recoveries ($15 million), partially offset by lower production volumes ($274 million), lower equity income ($2 million), and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($5 million).\nAdjusted EBITDA increased during fiscal 2021 by $176 million due primarily to higher current year volumes as explained above ($110 million), current year operational performance improvements ($61 million), lower administrative and engineering expense related to efficiencies and the impact of certain launch delays ($50 million), favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($51 million) and higher equity income ($1 million), partially offset by operational inefficiencies as a result of unplanned temporary production stoppages in the current year stemming from semiconductor shortages and to a lesser extent COVID-19 related costs ($55 million), unfavorable net commodity pricing adjustments ($11 million), unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($9 million), higher administrative and engineering expense due to prior year benefits that were not expected to recur ($18 million), and the impact of prior year divestitures primarily consisting of the RECARO and fabrics businesses ($4 million).\nRestructuring and Impairment Costs \nNet income attributable to Adient was $1,108 million for fiscal 2021, compared to a loss of $547 million for fiscal 2020. The increased net income attributable Adient is due to $1,214 million of one-time gains from sales of certain of Adient's equity interests in China, higher current year volumes primarily resulting from prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, current year operational improvements, lower restructuring charges, a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits, and a $231 million prior year non-cash impairment of the YFAI investment, partially offset by operational inefficiencies and premium freight caused by unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages, higher net financing charges, and higher income tax expense primarily resulting from the withholding taxes paid in association with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction.\nIn addition, Adient US and Adient Global Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, maintain a term loan credit agreement (the Term Loan B Agreement\u201d) that initially provided for a 5-year $800 million senior secured term loan facility that was fully drawn on closing. The Term Loan B Agreement amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate of 1.00% per annum of the original principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance originally due at final maturity on May 6, 2024. Interest on the Term Loan B Agreement accrues at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin originally equal to 4.25% (with one 0.25% step down based on achievement of a specific secured net leverage level starting with the fiscal quarter ending\nAdient US was also a party to an indenture relating to the issuance of $800 million aggregate principal amount of Senior First Lien Notes. The notes originally mature on May 15, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest on these notes was payable semi-annually in arrears on November 15 and May 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2019. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Adient repurchased $640 million of the outstanding balance of the Senior First Lien Notes at a price of 107% of the principal plus $17 million of accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, $9 million of previously deferred financing costs was written off to net financing charges. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, Adient redeemed the $160 million of remaining balance of the Senior First Lien Notes at a price of 103% of the principal plus $4 million of accrued and unpaid interest, and wrote off $3 million of previously deferred financing costs as a result of the debt extinguishment.\nAdient has also pursued, wherever it qualifies, governmental assistance. For example, Adient deferred the employer portion of FICA until fiscal 2021 or beyond and deferred VAT payments. Adient is seeking to take advantage of all such assistance to either defer payments to government authorities or to receive cash to help defray operating costs. Adient cannot guarantee that it will continue to qualify for, or receive any of, the assistance that it is pursuing.\nNet loss attributable to Adient was $547 million for fiscal 2020, compared to a loss of $491 million for fiscal 2019. The increased net loss attributable to Adient is primarily due to the impact of having significantly lower volumes due to COVID-19 along with a one-time non-cash impairment charge of $231 million on Adient's YFAI investment, a $25 million loss on the sale of the RECARO business and deconsolidation of Adient Aerospace, higher restructuring costs, and overall higher net financing costs, partially offset by operating improvements and lower administrative costs and one-time charges in the prior year related to impairment in the seat structures and mechanism business of $66 million and income tax charges to establish valuation allowances of $297 million.\nAmericas \nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: The significant increase in cash used by financing activities is primarily due to the repayment of long-term debt, including premium paid, of $895 million, the prior year draw down of the ABL revolver of $179 million, and the $600 million of proceeds from the issuance of 9.00% Senior Notes in April 2020, partially offset by the $214 million incremental borrowing in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 under the amended Term Loan B Agreement.\nRestructuring and impairment charges increased by $62 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher levels of restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2020 after the industry experienced significant volume decreases resulting from the COVID-19 impact, and $53 million of one-time non-cash impairment charges of long-lived assets in China and other assets held for sale, partially offset by one-time non-cash impairment charges in the prior year related to the seat structures and mechanisms business ($66 million).\nBased on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, Adient believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased by $21 million, or 4% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. SG&A was favorably impacted by lower overall engineering and other administrative spending ($41 million), and prior year RECARO and fabrics administrative costs ($30 million), partially offset by higher stock-based compensation costs ($21 million), prior year non-recurring favorable benefits related to actions taken as described in the On-Going Impact of COVID -19 section above ($4 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($21 million), and higher transaction costs ($4 million).\nThroughout fiscal year 2020 and 2021 and into fiscal year 2022, Adient continues to actively monitor the threat and impacts of COVID-19. Adient has taken, and continues to take, steps to mitigate the potential risks to the Company posed by COVID-19 and its impacts. In addition, Adient continues to assess and update its business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic, including analyzing constraints at its customers and suppliers, particularly components and labor-related shortages, respectively. Adient has taken precautions to help keep its workforce healthy and safe, including establishing a Global Response Team, implementing strict travel restrictions, enforcing rigorous hygiene protocols, increasing sanitization efforts at all facilities, enacting visitor restrictions, social distancing, face covering expectations, and temperature and health screenings and implementing remote working arrangements for the vast majority of Adient's employees who work outside the plants.\nNet sales increased during fiscal 2021 by $301 million due to higher production volumes across the region, which was primarily a result of prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19 and despite certain unplanned temporary production stoppages in the current year primarily resulting from semiconductor shortages ($263 million), the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($74 million), and the favorable impact of material economics recoveries ($9 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($31 million), and the impact of the prior year divestiture of RECARO ($14 million).\nAdient does not generally provide for additional income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. Adient's intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax efficient.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIncome Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nWorking capital\nEquity Income \nAdient records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Adient delivers products and records revenue pursuant to commercial agreements with its customers generally in the form of an approved purchase order, including the effects of contractual customer price productivity. Adient does negotiate discrete price changes with its customers, which are generally the result of unique commercial issues between Adient and its customers. Adient records amounts associated with discrete price changes as a reduction to revenue when specific facts and circumstances indicate that a price reduction is probable and the amounts are reasonably estimable. Adient records amounts associated with discrete price changes as an increase to revenue upon execution of a legally enforceable contractual agreement and when collectability is reasonably assured.

The increased level of comprehensive income attributable to Adient in fiscal 2021 is primarily due to higher net income ($1,676 million), the favorable change in foreign currency translation adjustments ($85 million) and favorable change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives ($40 million), partially offset by the increase in comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($13 million).\nOn April 20, 2020, Adient US offered $600 million (net proceeds of $591 million) aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025. These notes will mature on April 15, 2025, provided that if AGH has not refinanced (or otherwise redeemed) in whole its outstanding 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024 or any refinancing indebtedness thereof that matures earlier than 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Senior First Lien Notes due 2025 on or prior to May 15, 2024, these notes will mature on May 15, 2024. Interest on these notes is due on April 15 and October 15 each year, beginning on October 15, 2020. These notes contain covenants that are usual and customary, similar to the covenants on the Senior First Lien Notes due 2026 as described above. Adient incurred $10 million of debt issuance cost associated with this new debt in fiscal 2020.\n\nAdient evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using an adjusted EBITDA metric defined as income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, restructuring related-costs, net mark-to-market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans, transaction gains/losses, purchase accounting amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"). Also,\nSegment Analysis\nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: Capital expenditures decreased year over year based on timing of program spend on product launches including certain launch delays in EMEA and tightening controls around overall spending.\nAdient has made statements in this section and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Form 10-K\") that are management's perspective of forward-looking information and, therefore, are subject to risks and uncertainties.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the Adient's fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to Adient's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. The forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K are made only as of the date of this report, unless otherwise specified, and, except as required by law, Adient assumes no obligation, and disclaims any obligation, to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-K.\nAdient took significant measures to reduce its overall cash burn rate (defined as net cash outflow associated with operating the company) during the shutdown, including the furlough of direct/salary plant workers, reductions of salaries in all areas of the globe and retirement benefits for U.S. employees outside the plants, reduced/delayed capex spending to coincide with the resumption of production and effectively eliminating all discretionary spending.\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The decrease in operating cash flows is due primarily to lower levels of operating profits, partially offset by lower levels of trade working capital, specifically lower levels of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. See the working capital section below for further information on changes in working capital.\nDuring fiscal 2021, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (\"2021 Plan\") of $27 million that was offset by $16 million of prior year underspend. Of the restructuring costs recorded, $23 million related to the EMEA segment, $3 million related to the Americas segment, and $1 million relates to the Asia segment. Adient currently estimates that upon completion of the restructuring actions, the fiscal 2021 restructuring plan will reduce annual operating costs by approximately $23 million, which is primarily the result of lower costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses due to reduced employee-related costs, of which approximately 25%-35% will result in net savings. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by fiscal 2022.\nSee Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nRefer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the assets held for sale. Refer to Note 6, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the non-cash impairment charges of long-lived assets in fiscal 2020. Refer to Note 15, \"Restructuring and Impairment Costs,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to Adient's restructuring plans. Refer to Note 16, \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 42\nEquity income was $1,484 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $22 million for fiscal 2020. The significant increase during fiscal 2021 was due primarily to a one-time gain associated with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction ($1,181 million), one-time gain associated with the sale of Adient's interest in SJA ($33 million), a prior year non-cash impairment charge related to Adient's YFAI investment divestiture ($231 million), a one-time gain on previously held interest at YFAS in an affiliate during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 ($5 million), favorable impact of foreign currencies ($19 million), and prior year lower production volumes within Adient's China affiliates due to the impact of COVID-19 primarily during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 despite the current year operational interruptions and temporary production stoppages resulting from semiconductor chip shortages ($27 million). These were partially offset by the impact of prior year divestitures of YFAI and the fabrics business as well as current year divestiture of SJA ($30 million), and prior year tax benefits at various China affiliates that are not expected to recur ($10 million). As a result of the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction, equity income associated with the equity interests sold by Adient and, therefore will not recur, equaled $155 million, including the equity income associated with the entities which Adient acquired controlling interests. Refer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nto be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of Adient's consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nNet sales decreased during fiscal 2020 by $1,527 million due to lower production volumes ($1,353 million) resulting primarily from the operational shutdowns during fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic along with the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($137 million), the unfavorable impact of the RECARO divestiture ($39 million) and the unfavorable impact of material economics ($14 million), partially offset by favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($16 million).\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 49\nIn addition to the significant measures taken to reduce and contain costs, Adient took actions to provide additional liquidity, primarily including the draw down on its ABL revolving credit facility of $825 million at the end of March 2020 and the issuance of $600 million of senior secured notes due 2025 on April 20, 2020. Adient's ability to borrow against the ABL revolving credit facility is limited to its borrowing base, which consists primarily of accounts receivable, inventory and certain cash account balances at certain Adient subsidiaries. Adient repaid $825 million of the ABL revolving credit facility during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 and maintains $739 million of availability under the ABL revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2021.\nA summary of Adient's significant contractual obligations as of September 30, 2021:\nNotes:\nOn October 31, 2016, Adient became an independent company as a result of the separation of the automotive seating and interiors business from Johnson Controls. Adient was incorporated under the laws of Ireland in fiscal 2016 for the purpose of holding these businesses. Adient's ordinary shares began trading \"regular-way\" under the ticker symbol \"ADNT\" on the New York Stock Exchange on October 31, 2016. Upon becoming an independent company, the capital structure of Adient consisted of 500 million authorized ordinary shares and 100 million authorized preferred shares (par value of $0.001 per ordinary and preferred share). The number of Adient ordinary shares issued on October 31, 2016 was 93,671,810.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAdient US LLC (\"Adient US\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Adient, together with certain of Adient's other subsidiaries, maintains an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility\u201d), which provides for a revolving line of credit up to $1,250 million, including a North American subfacility of up to $950 million and a European subfacility of up to $300 million, subject to borrowing base capacity. The ABL Credit Facility will mature on May 6, 2024, subject to a springing maturity date 91 days earlier if certain amounts remain outstanding at that time under the Term Loan B Agreement (defined below). Interest is payable on the ABL Credit Facility at a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00%. Adient will pay a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% on the unused portion of the commitments under the asset-based revolving credit facility based on average global availability. Letters of credit are limited to the lesser of (x) $150 million and (y) the aggregate unused amount of commitments under the ABL Credit Facility then in effect. Subject to certain conditions, the ABL Credit Facility may be expanded by up to $250 million in additional commitments. Loans under the ABL Credit Facility may be denominated, at the option of Adient, in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling or Swedish Kroner. The ABL Credit Agreement is secured on a first-priority lien on all accounts receivable, inventory and bank accounts (and funds on deposit therein) and a second-priority lien on all of the tangible and intangible assets of certain Adient subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2021, Adient had not drawn down on the ABL Credit Facility and had availability under this facility of $739 million (net of $59 million of letters of credit).\n\nCost of sales increased by $776 million, or 6% and gross profit increased by $234 million, or 40%, in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The cost of sales year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in all regions ($507 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($258 million), higher commodity costs ($150 million), temporary operational inefficiencies including premium freight and unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages and to a lesser extent COVID-19 related costs ($165 million) and prior year non-recurring favorable benefits related to actions taken as described in the On-Going Impact of COVID-19 section above ($36 million), partially offset by the impact of prior year divestitures primarily consisting of the RECARO and fabrics businesses ($120 million), overall operational performance improvements ($106 million), favorable material margins ($76 million), and a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits ($38 million). The increase in gross profit was due to higher overall volumes, the favorable impact of foreign currencies, operational performance improvements, the favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments, including material economics, and the one-time gain in Brazil, partially offset by higher commodity costs, inefficiencies caused by unplanned production stoppages and certain prior year incentive compensation costs and to a lesser extent other benefits that were not expected to recur. Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment profitability.\nAdient Global Holdings Ltd. ( AGH\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, maintains $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% USD-denominated unsecured notes due 2026. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient redeemed $103 million of face value of these notes, resulting in a remaining balance of $797 million as of September 30, 2020. Adient recorded a gain of $3 million associated with this partial redemption. AGH also maintains \u20ac1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024.\nAlthough the global automotive industry experienced increased demand for new vehicles as Adient emerged from the global shutdowns in late fiscal year 2020 and early fiscal year 2021, it is possible that, in the event of the resurgence of COVID-19, the global automotive industry will experience significantly lower demand for new vehicle sales over the long-term as a result of the global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic because new vehicle sales are highly dependent on strong consumer confidence and low unemployment. As a result, new vehicle sales could be significantly lower than historical and previously projected pre-pandemic sales levels.\n\nAdient conducts its business globally in the automotive industry, which is highly competitive and sensitive to economic, political and social factors in the various regions. During fiscal 2020, automotive production across the globe declined due to the economic slow down resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2021, automotive production at the beginning of the year was higher in all regions, but experienced a slow down in the second half of the fiscal year due to the widespread supply chain disruptions impacting the global automotive industry.\nOther pension expense (income) consists of mark-to-market adjustments of Adient's retirement plans and non-service components of Adient's net periodic pension costs. A pension mark-to-market gain ($15 million) occurred in fiscal 2021 compared to the $22 million mark-to-market charge in fiscal 2020. The decrease in pension expense in fiscal 2020 is due to the lower level of pension mark-to-market impact (a $22 million charge in fiscal 2020 compared to a $49 million charge in fiscal 2019), partially offset by a $2 million pension settlement expense related to the settlement of two plans in the United States. Refer to Note 14, \"Retirement Plans,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the components of Adient's net periodic pension costs.\nOn-Going Impact of COVID-19\n\u2022Net income attributable to Adient was $1,108 million for fiscal 2021, compared to a loss of $547 million for fiscal 2020. The increased net income attributable to Adient is due to $1,214 million of one-time gains from sales of certain of Adient's equity interests in China, higher current year volumes primarily resulting from prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, current year operational improvements, lower restructuring charges, a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits, and a $231 million prior year non-cash impairment of the YFAI investment, partially offset by operational inefficiencies and premium freight caused by unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages, higher net financing charges, and higher income tax expense primarily resulting from the withholding taxes paid in association with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction.\n(1) Includes $67 million of committed capital expenditures.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 30\nThe impact of COVID-19, and related mutations, continues to be present throughout the world, including in all global and regional markets served by Adient. Although vaccines have been introduced that are expected to have the result of reducing the effect of COVID-19 and COVID-19 started to wane in certain geographic areas, governmental authorities continue to implement numerous measures attempting to contain and mitigate the effects of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, social distancing orders, shelter in place orders and shutdowns of non-essential activities. Adient's manufacturing facilities are located in areas that continue to be affected by the pandemic.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 43\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nDuring fiscal 2019, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (\"2019 Plan\") of $105 million. Of the restructuring costs recorded, $81 million relates to the EMEA segment, $16 million relates to the Americas segment and $8 million relates to the Asia segment. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions. Also recorded in fiscal 2019 was $16 million of prior year underspend, a $9 million increase to a prior year reserve and $6 million of recoveries from a customer related to previous restructuring charges.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 29\nNet Sales \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nAdient prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following policies are considered by management\nThe fiscal 2021 income tax expense of $249 million was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, the establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, and the repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by tax benefits from audit settlements, the write-off of deferred tax liabilities related to withholding taxes, and withholding taxes on the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction at a rate lower than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5%.\nAdient designs, manufactures and markets a full range of seating systems and components for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and light trucks, including vans, pick-up trucks and sport/crossover utility vehicles. Adient operates in 208 wholly- and\nThe increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2021 is attributable to higher income resulting from higher volumes in the current year, attributable primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at certain Seating affiliates in varying jurisdictions during the prior year. The decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to lower income resulting from lower volumes, as a result of the COVID-19 impact at certain Seating affiliates in varying jurisdictions during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased by $113 million, or 17%, in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. SG&A was favorably impacted by lower overall administrative and engineering spending ($88 million), including lower levels of certain compensation and discretionary spending which are not expected to recur as part of the annual SG&A run rate, prior year Adient Aerospace and RECARO costs ($39 million), lower share based compensation expense ($5 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency ($5 million), partially offset by higher transaction costs in the current year related to the Yanfeng transaction and sale of the fabrics business ($12 million). Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment profitability.\nAs previously disclosed, beginning at the end of January 2020 and continuing through June 2020, Adient experienced the shutdown of its facilities in all geographic regions (Asia, Americas and EMEA) at various points in time. Production finally started to resume in all regions and continued to ramp up through Adient's fiscal fourth quarter, and as of December 31, 2020, virtually all of Adient's plants had resumed production.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 31\nNet sales increased by $1,010 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the prior year significant operational interruptions related to COVID-19 starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 which resulted in lower sales volumes across all regions and despite current year certain unplanned temporary production stoppages primarily resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages ($786 million), favorable foreign currency impact ($273 million), favorable material economics recoveries ($83 million), and favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments, partially offset by the impact of divestitures primarily related to RECARO and fabrics businesses ($156 million). Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment net sales.\nThe ABL Credit Facility, Term Loan B Agreement and the Senior First Lien Notes due 2026 contain covenants that are usual and customary for facilities and debt instruments of this type and that, among other things, restrict the ability of Adient and its restricted subsidiaries to: create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee certain indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, Adient's capital stock or certain other debt; make other restricted payments; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of Adient's and its restricted subsidiaries' assets, to another person. These covenants are subject to a number of other limitations and exceptions set forth in the agreements. The agreements also provide for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, cross-default clauses with other debt arrangements, failure to pay principal and interest, failure to comply with covenants, agreements or conditions, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency involving Adient and its significant subsidiaries.\nOverview\nAsia\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 33\nThe fiscal 2020 income tax expense of $57 million was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, the repatriation of foreign earnings, and changes in uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the tax benefits related to the impairment and sale of Adient's YFAI investment, sale of Adient's automotive fabrics manufacturing business, and impairment charges recorded in the Asia segment.\n(7) The year ended September 30, 2021 reflects a one-time gain of $38 million associated with the retrospective recovery of indirect tax credits in Brazil resulting from a favorable court ruling (of which $36 million relates to recoveries covering the past 20 years and is adjusted out of Americas' segment results), a $5 million gain on previously held interest at YFAS in an affiliate, and $19 million of transaction costs. The year ended September 30, 2020 includes $15 million of transaction costs and $1 million of tax adjustments at YFAI. The year ended September 30, 2019 includes $4 million of integration costs associated with the acquisition of Futuris, $3 million of transaction costs and $2 million of tax adjustments at YFAI.\nSeparation from the former Parent\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures in the current year as well as $329 million of proceeds from the Yanfeng transaction and $170 million of net proceeds from the sale of the fabrics business, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of assets as compared to the prior year and a $37 million cash outflow as a result of the deconsolidation of the Adient Aerospace joint venture.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to decreased year over year spending based on timing of program spend on product launches and tightening controls around overall spending.\nAdient enters into supply chain financing programs in certain foreign jurisdictions to sell accounts receivable without recourse to third-party financial institutions. Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial position and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of September 30, 2021, $132 million has been funded under these programs.\nEquity income was $22 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $275 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease during fiscal 2020 was due primarily to the non-cash impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2020 of the YFAI investment as part of the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction ($231 million), and the impact from the planned divestiture of YFAI ($26 million), partially offset by higher income at certain China seating affiliates that included $10 million of benefits from tax credits at various China affiliates that are not expected to recur.\nAdient does not generally provide for additional income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. Adient's intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax efficient.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 37\nAdient's primary liquidity needs are to fund general business requirements, including working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring costs and debt service requirements. Adient's principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, the revolving credit facility and other debt issuances, and existing cash balances. Adient actively manages its working capital and associated cash requirements and continually seeks more effective uses of cash. Working capital is highly influenced by the timing of cash flows associated with sales and purchases, and therefore can be difficult to manage at times. See below and refer to Note 9, \"Debt and Financing Arrangements,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of financing arrangements. Refer to Note 3, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" for more information on strategic transactions that have provided significant liquidity that will allow for additional voluntary debt pay down in fiscal 2022. Following the first quarter of fiscal 2019 dividend payout, Adient has suspended future dividends.\n\u2022Adient recorded net sales of $13,680 million for fiscal 2021, representing an increase of $1,010 million when compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales is attributable to prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, the favorable impact of foreign currencies and favorable material economics recoveries, partially offset by current year temporary operational interruptions and production stoppages primarily resulting from semiconductor chip shortages, and prior year divestitures primarily consisting of the fabrics businesses, and unfavorable commercial settlements.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 35\nNet sales decreased by $3,856 million, or 23%, in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the significant operational interruptions related to COVID-19 starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 which resulted in lower sales volumes across all regions, unfavorable foreign currency impact ($217 million), and the impact of divestitures primarily related to RECARO ($115 million), partially offset by favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments, including material economics, net of recoveries. Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment net sales.\n\nNet financing charges increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of premium and related transaction costs paid on the repurchase of debt ($50 million), a write off of the associated deferred financing costs ($20 million), a derivative loss associated with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction ($30 million), and higher levels of outstanding debt and higher average interest rates during the current fiscal year. Net financing charges increased in fiscal 2020 as a result of higher levels of outstanding debt and to higher average interest rates in fiscal 2020, partially offset by $3 million of net gain resulting from the partial extinguishment of debt. Refer to Note 9, \"Debt and Financing Arrangements,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the components of Adient's net financing charges.\nAdient monitors its investments in partially-owned affiliates for indicators of other-than-temporary declines in value on an ongoing basis. If Adient determines that an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred, it recognizes an impairment loss, which is measured as the difference between the recorded book value and the fair value of the investment. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flows or negotiated transaction values. During fiscal 2020, Adient entered into an agreement to, among other things, transfer all of the issued and outstanding equity interest in YFAI held, directly or indirectly, by Adient, which represented 30% of YFAI's total issued and outstanding equity interest, to Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Company Ltd. for $369 million, of which $309 million was paid at closing and $60 million is to be paid on a deferred basis. This transaction closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Adient concluded that indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present in certain quarters during fiscal 2020 related to the investment in YFAI and recorded a total of $231 million non-cash impairment of Adient's YFAI investment within equity income. The impairments were determined based on combining the fair value of consideration received for all transactions contemplated within the Master Agreement, including an estimated fair value of the YFAS joint venture extension, and allocating the total consideration received to the individual transactions based on relative fair values. Adient estimated the fair value of the individual transactions using both an income approach and market approach. The inputs utilized in the fair value analyses of the transactions are classified as level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement\" and primarily consisted of expected future operating margins and cash flows of YFAI, estimated production volumes, estimated dividend payments from YFAS over the extension period, estimated terminal values of YFAS, market comparables, weighted-average costs of capital (YFAI - 15.0%, YFAS - 10.5%), and noncontrolling interest discounts. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d and Note 19, \"Nonconsolidated Partially-Owned Affiliates,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe automotive production shutdown in fiscal 2020 also significantly impacted Adient's daily working capital. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient experienced significantly lower trade working capital balances (accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable) due to the shutdown of production in the early part of the third quarter and resumption of production only toward the latter part of the quarter. Trade working capital was favorably impacted during the early part of the third quarter but was more than offset by the unfavorable impact to trade working capital during the latter part of the quarter. The resumption of production in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 had a favorable impact to trade working capital as Adient returned to a more stabilized production run rate.\nCost of Sales / Gross Profit\nComprehensive Income Attributable to Adient\noverall decline in forecasted operations within that business. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Adient concluded it had triggering events requiring assessment of impairment of long-lived assets in the seat structure and mechanism operations. As a result, Adient reviewed the long-lived assets for impairment and recorded a $66 million impairment charge within restructuring and impairment costs on the consolidated statements of income (loss). The impairment charge related to long-lived assets in North America and Europe asset groups as of March 31, 2019 in support of current programs. No other long-lived asset impairments were identified in fiscal 2019. These impairments were measured, depending on the asset, either under an income approach utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows or a market approach utilizing appraisal techniques to determine fair values of the impaired assets. These methods are consistent with the methods Adient employed in prior periods to value other long-lived assets. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement\" and primarily consist of expected future operating margins and cash flows, estimated production volumes, weighted average cost of capital rates (13.0%), estimated salable values and third-party appraisal techniques such as market comparables. To the extent that profitability on current or future programs decline as compared to forecasted profitability or if adverse changes occur to key assumptions or other fair value measurement inputs, further impairment of long-lived assets could occur in the future. Refer to Note 16, \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nNet sales increased during fiscal 2021 by $416 million as a result of prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19 and despite certain unplanned temporary production stoppages in the current year primarily resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages ($254 million), the favorable impact of foreign currency ($234 million), the favorable impact of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($22 million), and the favorable impact of material economics recoveries ($50 million), partially offset by the impact of prior year divestitures primarily consisting of the RECARO and fabrics businesses ($144 million).\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019: The increase in cash from financing activities is primarily attributable to the issuance of $600 million of debt in fiscal 2020 along with lower repayments of long-term debt.\n(2) Reflects restructuring charges for costs that are directly attributable to restructuring activities and meet the definition of restructuring under ASC 420 and non-recurring impairment charges. Included in restructuring charges in fiscal 2021 is a $9 million held for sale non-cash impairment charge in EMEA, and a $1 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets in EMEA. Included in restructuring charges in fiscal 2020 is a non-cash pre-tax impairment related to China intangible assets of $24 million, held for sale asset impairments of $21 million, and $8 million of other long-lived asset impairments. Included in restructuring charges in fiscal 2019 is a $66 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets ($11 million in the Americas and $55 million in EMEA) and an $18 million non-cash impairment charge related to assets held for sale ($6 million in the Americas and $12 million in Asia). Refer to Note 6, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" Note 15, \"Restructuring and Impairment Costs,\" and Note 16, \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nCash flows from operating activities\nThe fiscal 2019 income tax expense of $410 million was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the recognition of valuation allowances in Luxembourg, Poland, and the United Kingdom, repatriation of foreign earnings, changes in uncertain tax positions, and the impact of recognizing no tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances.\nAdient accrues costs in connection with its restructuring actions. These accruals include estimates primarily related to employee headcount, local statutory benefits, and other employee termination costs. Actual costs may vary from these estimates. These accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified. Refer to Note 15, Restructuring and Impairment Costs,\u201d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2019 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence (including the external debt refinancing, the related incremental net financing costs, and the restructuring of the internal financing which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and including the long-lived asset impairment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2019), Adient determined it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets in Luxembourg (Q3), the United Kingdom (Q3) and certain Poland entities (Q2) would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $229 million, $25 million and $43 million, respectively, to establish valuation allowances.\nGlobal Automotive Industry\nmajority-owned manufacturing or assembly facilities, with operations in 33 countries. Additionally, Adient has partially-owned affiliates in China, Asia, Europe and North America. Through its global footprint and vertical integration, Adient leverages its capabilities to drive growth in the automotive seating industry.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 44\nIndebtedness\nLight vehicle production levels by geographic region are provided below:\n\n($3 million), and the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($29 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of material economics, net of recoveries ($9 million), unfavorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($21 million), the impact of current year divestiture of SJA ($9 million), the impact of prior year divestiture of YFAI ($18 million) and RECARO ($5 million), prior year tax benefits at various affiliates that were not expected to recur ($10 million), higher administrative expense due in part to prior year benefits that were not expected to recur ($9 million), and operational inefficiencies including premium freight and unplanned temporary production stoppages resulting from semiconductor shortages and to a lesser extent COVID-19 related costs ($6 million).\n(6) The year ended September 30, 2021 includes a gain associated with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction of $1,181 million and a gain of $33 million on the sale of Adient's interest in SJA. The year ended September 30, 2020 includes non-cash impairment charges related to Adient's YFAI investment balance recorded in conjunction with the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction. All of these impacts have been recorded within the equity income line in the consolidated statements of income.\nIn fiscal 2021, total Adient contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were $23 million. Adient expects to contribute at least $16 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2021, total Adient contributions to the postretirement plans were not significant.\nAdient Germany Ltd. & Co. KG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adient, maintains \u20ac135 million in an unsecured term loan from the European Investment Bank ( EIB\u201d) due in 2022. The loan bears interest at the 6-month EURIBOR rate plus 158 basis points. Adient is compliant with the net leverage ratio at September 30, 2021 and expects to be compliant for the remainder of the term. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, Adient repaid $16 million of the EIB loan, triggered in part by the redemption of debt in the prior year. Adient repaid $20 million of the EIB loan in May 2021, triggered by the prior year sale of the fabrics business.\nAdient is subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.S. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of Adient's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Adient's income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under audit by the respective tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nContractual Obligations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nDecember 31, 2019). The Term Loan B Agreement also permits Adient to incur incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $750 million and an unlimited amount subject to a pro forma first lien secured net leverage ratio of not greater than 1.75 to 1.00 and certain other conditions. In April 2021, Adient amended the Term Loan B Agreement (\"Amended Agreement\") which, among other changes (i) extended the maturity date for loans outstanding to April 8, 2028, (ii) reduced the interest rate margin applicable thereunder by 0.75% to 3.50%, in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans, and 2.50% (in the case of Base Rate loans) (in each case, with one 0.25% step down based on achievement of a specified first lien secured net leverage level starting with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021) and (iii) made certain other negative covenant and mandatory prepayment changes in connection therewith. The amendment also established incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $214 million resulting in total loans outstanding under the Amended Agreement of $1.0 billion. Adient paid $7 million related to the Amended Agreement and wrote off $8 million of previously deferred financing costs as a result of the debt extinguishment during the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased during fiscal 2021 by $4 million due primarily to higher current year volumes as explained above and product mix ($120 million), operational performance improvements ($3 million), the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($8 million), and favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($70 million), partially offset by operational inefficiencies including premium freight and unplanned temporary production stoppages in the current year resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages and to a lesser extent COVID-19 related costs ($104 million), higher administrative expense primarily related to certain prior year benefits related costs that were not expected to recur, net of current year efficiency improvements ($44 million), the unfavorable material economics, net of recoveries ($46 million), and lower equity income ($3 million).\nIn estimating the expected return on plan assets, Adient considers the historical returns on plan assets, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans' invested assets. Reflecting the relatively long-term nature of the plans' obligations, approximately 60% of the plans' assets are invested in fixed income securities and 15% in equity securities, with the remainder primarily invested in alternative investments. For fiscal years 2021 and 2020, Adient's expected long-term return on U.S. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 5.75% and 5.75% respectively. The actual rate of return on U.S. pension plans was below 5.75% in fiscal 2021 and 2020. For fiscal years 2021 and 2020, Adient's weighted average expected long-term return on non-U.S. pension plan assets was 3.68% and 4.01%, respectively. The actual rate of return on non-U.S. pension plans was above 3.68% in fiscal 2021 and was above 4.01% in fiscal 2020.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken to restrain the spread of the virus have had, and may continue to have, a material negative impact on Adient's financial results and liquidity, and such negative impact may continue well beyond the containment of COVID-19 through the results of widespread use of the vaccine or otherwise. Adient cannot assure that the assumptions used to estimate its liquidity requirements will be correct because it has never previously experienced such a widespread cessation of its operations as it experienced during fiscal year 2020, and it is unclear what the lasting impacts of the slowdown in the automotive industry will be. In addition, the magnitude, duration, speed and potential resurgence or surges of the global pandemic are all uncertain. Consequently, the impact of the pandemic and its myriad of effects on Adient's business, financial condition or longer-term financial or operational results remain uncertain. Based on the actions it has taken and its current assumptions regarding the impact of COVID-19, Adient believes that its current financial resources will be sufficient to fund the company's liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.\n\u2022Equity income was $1,484 million for fiscal 2021, which compares to equity income of $22 million for fiscal 2020. The significant increase is primarily attributable to a $1,181 million current year gain recognized upon sales of certain of Adient's equity interests in China as part of the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction and $33 million current year gain on the sale of SJA, favorable impact of foreign currencies, a $231 million prior year non-cash impairment of the YFAI investment as part of the 2020 Yanfeng transaction, and operational performance improvements primarily at Adient's affiliates in China. Excluding the impacts of current year transactional gains and prior year impairments, equity income increased by $17 million.\nAdient is subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.S. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of Adient's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Adient's income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under audit by the respective tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 50\nAdient reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary.\nSources of Cash Flows\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 32\nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: The increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to higher levels of operating profits, partially offset by unfavorable changes to working capital year-over-year driven by higher levels of inventory, higher levels of restructuring amounts paid and higher levels of interest paid in the current year.\n\n(1) Corporate-related costs not allocated to the segments include executive office, communications, corporate development, legal and corporate finance.\nAdient utilizes a mark-to-market approach for recognizing pension benefit expenses, including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event.\n\nAdient reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets with definite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Adient conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, \"Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\" ASC 360-10-15 requires Adient to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. Intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing as part of their asset group if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of an impairment within a separate China entity and as a result recorded a $5 million pre-tax non-cash impairment in the Asia segment related to long-lived assets due to an overall decline in the forecasted operations within that business. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, Adient concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment within the Futuris China business and as a result recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment of $27 million in the Asia segment, which consisted of customer relationship intangible assets of $24 million and other long-lived assets of $3 million, due to an\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 34\nThe global automotive industry continues to experience widespread supply chain disruptions primarily related to semiconductor chip shortages. Although Adient's seating products are not highly dependent on semiconductor chips, Adient is directly impacted by the lower production levels at the OEM's as a result of these supply disruptions. These disruptions have led to unplanned downtime at Adient's production facilities, often with very little warning, which results in operating inefficiencies and limits Adient's ability to adequately mitigate such inefficiencies. The automotive industry has also experienced a period of sustained price increases for commodities, primarily related to steel, and to a lesser extent petrochemicals. Shipping costs have also sharply increased throughout the fiscal year. These commodity and shipping cost increases may continue into the future as demand increases and supply may remain constrained, which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset. Adient is also closely monitoring labor availability and wage inflationary pressures, both internally and at key vendors, to assess any impact labor shortages and wage inflation might have on Adient's ability to perform its obligations. Although Adient has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, commodity and shipping costs, these strategies (which include targeted SG&A savings through hiring freezes, delayed merit increases, suspended 401(k) matches in the U.S. and RSU replacement awards in lieu of salary for certain executives of Adient), together with commercial negotiations with Adient's customers and suppliers, are only expected to offset a portion of the adverse impact. Refer to the consolidated results of operations and segment analysis discussion below for additional information on the impacts of these items on Adient's results. Also refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors section for additional information.\nSignificant aspects of Adient's financial results for fiscal 2021 include the items discussed below. The recently completed transactions in China had a significant impact on the fiscal 2021 financial results. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on these transactions.\nAdient considers the expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis when setting assumed discount rates. As a result, Adient uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction, the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For the U.S. pension plans, Adient uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds. For the non-U.S. pension, Adient consistently uses the\nIncome Tax Provision\nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2020 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions would not be realized. These valuation allowances did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring fiscal 2020, Adient committed to a restructuring plan (\"2020 Plan\") of $205 million. Of the restructuring costs recorded, $20 million relates to the Americas segment, $175 million relates to the EMEA segment and $10 million relates to the Asia segment. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions. Adient currently estimates that upon completion of the restructuring actions, the fiscal 2020 restructuring plan will reduce annual operating costs by approximately $180 million, which is primarily the result of lower costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses due to reduced employee-related costs, of which approximately 35%-40% will result in net savings. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by fiscal 2024.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 48\nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: The increase in cash provided by investing activities is due to higher levels of proceeds received from business divestitures (primarily $715 million from the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction and $53 million from the sale of SJA) and lower levels of capital expenditures, partially offset by business acquisitions in the current year.\n\nrelevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates. Adient's discount rate on U.S. pension plans was 3.06% and 2.91% at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Adient's weighted average discount rate on non-U.S. plans was 1.71% and 1.87% at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 38\nThe effects of inflation have historically not been significant to Adient's results of operations. Generally, Adient has been able to implement operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate. The automotive industry has recently experienced a period of sustained price increases for commodities such as steel and to a lesser extent petrochemicals, as well as higher freight costs, that may continue in the future as demand increases and supply may remain constrained which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 40\nFinancial Results Summary\nEMEA \n\nAdient manages its business on a geographic basis and operates in the following three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; 2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\") and 3) Asia Pacific/China (\"Asia\").\nPresentation of Information\nAdient is a global leader in the automotive seating supply industry with relationships with the largest global auto manufacturers. Adient's technologies extend into virtually every area of automotive seating solutions, including complete seating systems, frames, mechanisms, foam, head restraints, armrests and trim covers. Adient is an independent seat supplier with global scale and the capability to design, develop, engineer, manufacture and deliver complete seat systems and components in every major automotive producing region in the world.\nCash flows from financing activities\nUnless the context requires otherwise, references to \"Adient plc\" or \"Adient\" refer to Adient plc and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods subsequent to its separation from Johnson Controls International plc (\"the former Parent\") on October 31, 2016. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the \"separation\" refer to the legal separation and transfer of the former Parent's automotive seating and interiors business to Adient on October 31, 2016. The information presented herein are based on management's perspective of Adient's results of operations.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Adient\nOther Pension Expense (Income) \nAs a result of Adient's fiscal 2021 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in the Czech Republic, Korea, Mexico, and other jurisdictions would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $5 million, $5 million, $8 million, and $4 million, respectively, to establish valuation allowances. Adient continues to record valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and other jurisdictions as it remains more likely than not that they will not be realized.\nFor fiscal 2022, Adient estimates the long-term rate of return will approximate 5.75% and 3.20% for U.S. pension and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Any differences between actual investment results and the expected long-term asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. If Adient's actual returns on plan assets are less than Adient's expectations, additional contributions may be required.\nNet sales decreased during fiscal 2020 by $1,896 million due to lower production volumes ($1,787 million) resulting primarily from the operational shutdowns during fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as $55 million attributable to the GM labor strike during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and the impact of Adient specific launches, along with the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($75 million), the unfavorable impact of material economics ($21 million), and the unfavorable impact of the RECARO divestiture ($39 million), partially offset by the favorable impact of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($26 million).\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased during fiscal 2020 by $60 million due to lower volumes ($243 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($12 million), unfavorable material economics, net of recovery ($10 million), and lower equity income ($3 million), partially offset by operational performance improvements ($91 million), lower administrative and engineering expense ($56 million) including lower levels of certain compensation and discretionary spending which are not expected to recur as part of the annual run rate, favorable net material and pricing adjustments ($57 million), and the favorable impact of divestitures primarily related to RECARO ($4 million).\nComprehensive loss attributable to Adient was $643 million for fiscal 2020 compared to comprehensive loss attributable to Adient for fiscal 2019 of $529 million. This increased level of comprehensive loss attributable to Adient in fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of higher levels of net loss ($56 million), the unfavorable impact in foreign currency transaction adjustments resulting from overall weakening of emerging market currencies, partially offset by the strengthening of the Chinese yuan ($34 million), and the unfavorable impact in realized and unrealized losses on derivatives ($19 million), partially offset by the decrease in comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($15 million).\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Adient records a valuation allowance that primarily represents operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain. Management judgment is required in determining Adient's provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against Adient's net deferred tax assets.\nThe increase in working capital of $912 million is primarily attributable to higher levels of inventory and other current assets (of which $643 million is attributable to the receivable related to the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction), lower levels of restructuring reserve, and other current liabilities, partially offset by lower levels of accounts receivable.\nRevenue Recognition\nCapital expenditures\nRefer to Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for Adient's income tax disclosures.\nU.S. GAAP requires that companies recognize in the statement of financial position a liability for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are underfunded or unfunded, or an asset for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are overfunded. U.S. GAAP also requires that companies measure the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets that determine a benefit plan's funded status as of the date of the employer's fiscal year end.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 36\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased during fiscal 2020 by $89 million due to the impact of lower production volumes ($73 million), the unfavorable impact of the planned YFAI divestiture ($26 million), unfavorable material economics, net of recoveries ($3 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($12 million), the unfavorable impact of the RECARO divestiture ($9 million), and higher administrative and engineering costs ($2 million), partially offset by operational performance improvements ($8 million), higher equity income from China seating affiliates that included $10 million of benefits from tax credits at various China affiliates that are not expected to recur ($16 million), and favorable net material and pricing adjustments ($12 million).\n(5) The year ended September 30, 2021 includes a $21 million loss associated with certain aspects of the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction and a $5 million loss on sale of non-core assets in China. The year ended September 30, 2020 includes a $21 million loss of sale of RECARO and $4 million loss on deconsolidation of Aerospace, partially offset by a $12 million gain on completion of the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction.\nCost of sales decreased by $3,647 million, or 23%, and gross profit decreased by $209 million, or 26%, in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. Cost of sales were lower primarily due to the decrease in sales volumes as a result of the COVID-19 impact along with overall business performance improvements, the favorable impact of foreign currency ($195 million), and the impact of divestitures primarily related to RECARO ($97 million). Gross profit was lower as a result of the negative impact of lower sales volume due to the COVID-19 impact, partially offset by the impact of business performance improvements including lower launch inefficiencies, and reductions in operational waste and freight along with favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments. Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment profitability.\nNet sales increased during fiscal 2021 by $275 million as a result of prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19 and despite certain unplanned temporary production stoppages in the current year primarily resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages ($262 million), favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($33 million), and the favorable impact of material economics recoveries ($24 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($34 million), and the impact of the prior year divestiture of RECARO ($10 million).\nAdient provides a range of pension benefits to its employees and retired employees. These benefits are Adient's direct obligation and have been recorded within Adient's consolidated financial statements. Plan assets and obligations are measured annually, or more frequently if there is a remeasurement event, based on Adient's measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date. Adient reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 45\n\nAdient manages its business on a geographic basis and operates in the following three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; 2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\") and 3) Asia Pacific/China (\"Asia\").\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 46\nGoodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired. Adient reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. Adient performs impairment reviews for its reporting units, which have been determined to be Adient's reportable segments, using a fair value method based on management's judgments and assumptions or third-party valuations. The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In estimating the fair value, Adient uses the income approach in which discounted cash flow analyses are used to derive estimates of fair value of each reporting unit. Multiples of earnings based on the average of historical, published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics are also used in developing estimated fair values. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement.\" These calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions about market comparables, future cash flows and appropriate discount rates (based on weighted average cost of capital ranging from 15.0% - 17.5% at September 30, 2021) to reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows and to derive a reasonable enterprise value and related premium. The estimated future cash flows reflect management's latest assumptions of the financial projections based on current and anticipated competitive landscape, including estimates of revenue based on production volumes over the foreseeable future and long-term growth rates, and operating margins based on historical trends and future cost containment activities. The financial projections also considered the impact that COVID-19, operational interruptions due to semiconductor shortages and higher commodity and shipping costs are having on Adient's current and future operations as well as the impact to new vehicle sales in future years. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on the results of the goodwill impairment test and on Adient's results of operations. The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. Adient is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. As a result of the tests, there was no goodwill impairment recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Refer to Note 6, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\u2022Gross profit was $826 million, or 6.0% of net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to $592 million, or 4.7% of net sales for fiscal 2020. Profitability, including gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was higher due to higher current year volumes primarily resulting from prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, current year operational improvements, a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits, the favorable impact of foreign currencies, and favorable commercial settlements, partially offset by temporary operational inefficiencies and premium freight caused by unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor chip shortages, and unfavorable impacts of material economics, net of recoveries.\nNet Financing Charge \nAdient evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using an adjusted EBITDA metric defined as income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, restructuring related-costs, net mark-to-market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans, transaction gains/losses, purchase accounting amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"). Also, certain corporate-related costs are not allocated to the segments. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets served by Adient and reflect the financial information that is reviewed by its chief operating decision maker. Refer to Note 18, \"Segment Information,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on Adient's reportable segments.\nRestructuring and impairment costs were lower by $217 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to higher levels of restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2020 after the industry experienced significant volume decreases resulting from the COVID-19 impact, and $53 million of one-time non-cash impairment charges in the prior year of long-lived assets in China and other assets held for sale.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 39\nAdient reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. All of the factors that Adient considers in evaluating whether and when to establish or release all or a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance involve significant judgment. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased during fiscal 2021 by $62 million due primarily to higher current year volumes as explained above ($50 million), higher equity income as a result of the prior year operational interruptions at Adient's China affiliates due to COVID-19 ($34 million), operational performance improvements ($33 million), lower administrative and engineering expense\n\ncertain corporate-related costs are not allocated to the segments. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets served by Adient and reflect the financial information that is reviewed by its chief operating decision maker.\nRestructuring Costs\n(3) Reflects amortization of intangible assets including those related to partially owned affiliates recorded within equity income.\nNet sales decreased during the fiscal 2020 by $515 million due to lower production volumes ($474 million) primarily resulting from the operational shutdowns in China and in other Asia countries in fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the unfavorable impact of the RECARO divestiture ($37 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($13 million), and the unfavorable impact of material economics ($3 million), partially offset by the favorable impact of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($12 million).\n\nRefer to Note 14, \"Retirement Plans,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on Adient's pension plans.\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 41\nSupply Chain Disruptions and Inflationary Pressures\nIncome Taxes\n\nAdient plc | Form 10-K | 47\nAdjusted EBITDA increased during fiscal 2020 by $18 million due to the impact of operational performance improvements ($104 million), lower administrative and engineering expense ($100 million) including lower levels of certain compensation and discretionary spending which are not expected to recur as part of the annual run rate, the favorable impact of Adient Aerospace deconsolidation and RECARO divestiture ($25 million), the favorable impact of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($55 million) and favorable material economics, net of recoveries ($15 million), partially offset by lower production volumes ($274 million), lower equity income ($2 million), and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($5 million).\nAdjusted EBITDA increased during fiscal 2021 by $176 million due primarily to higher current year volumes as explained above ($110 million), current year operational performance improvements ($61 million), lower administrative and engineering expense related to efficiencies and the impact of certain launch delays ($50 million), favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($51 million) and higher equity income ($1 million), partially offset by operational inefficiencies as a result of unplanned temporary production stoppages in the current year stemming from semiconductor shortages and to a lesser extent COVID-19 related costs ($55 million), unfavorable net commodity pricing adjustments ($11 million), unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($9 million), higher administrative and engineering expense due to prior year benefits that were not expected to recur ($18 million), and the impact of prior year divestitures primarily consisting of the RECARO and fabrics businesses ($4 million).\nRestructuring and Impairment Costs \nNet income attributable to Adient was $1,108 million for fiscal 2021, compared to a loss of $547 million for fiscal 2020. The increased net income attributable Adient is due to $1,214 million of one-time gains from sales of certain of Adient's equity interests in China, higher current year volumes primarily resulting from prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19, current year operational improvements, lower restructuring charges, a one-time gain associated with retrospective recoveries of Brazil indirect tax credits, and a $231 million prior year non-cash impairment of the YFAI investment, partially offset by operational inefficiencies and premium freight caused by unplanned production stoppages resulting from semiconductor and petrochemical shortages, higher net financing charges, and higher income tax expense primarily resulting from the withholding taxes paid in association with the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction.\nIn addition, Adient US and Adient Global Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, maintain a term loan credit agreement (the Term Loan B Agreement\u201d) that initially provided for a 5-year $800 million senior secured term loan facility that was fully drawn on closing. The Term Loan B Agreement amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate of 1.00% per annum of the original principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance originally due at final maturity on May 6, 2024. Interest on the Term Loan B Agreement accrues at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin originally equal to 4.25% (with one 0.25% step down based on achievement of a specific secured net leverage level starting with the fiscal quarter ending\nAdient US was also a party to an indenture relating to the issuance of $800 million aggregate principal amount of Senior First Lien Notes. The notes originally mature on May 15, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest on these notes was payable semi-annually in arrears on November 15 and May 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2019. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Adient repurchased $640 million of the outstanding balance of the Senior First Lien Notes at a price of 107% of the principal plus $17 million of accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, $9 million of previously deferred financing costs was written off to net financing charges. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, Adient redeemed the $160 million of remaining balance of the Senior First Lien Notes at a price of 103% of the principal plus $4 million of accrued and unpaid interest, and wrote off $3 million of previously deferred financing costs as a result of the debt extinguishment.\nAdient has also pursued, wherever it qualifies, governmental assistance. For example, Adient deferred the employer portion of FICA until fiscal 2021 or beyond and deferred VAT payments. Adient is seeking to take advantage of all such assistance to either defer payments to government authorities or to receive cash to help defray operating costs. Adient cannot guarantee that it will continue to qualify for, or receive any of, the assistance that it is pursuing.\nNet loss attributable to Adient was $547 million for fiscal 2020, compared to a loss of $491 million for fiscal 2019. The increased net loss attributable to Adient is primarily due to the impact of having significantly lower volumes due to COVID-19 along with a one-time non-cash impairment charge of $231 million on Adient's YFAI investment, a $25 million loss on the sale of the RECARO business and deconsolidation of Adient Aerospace, higher restructuring costs, and overall higher net financing costs, partially offset by operating improvements and lower administrative costs and one-time charges in the prior year related to impairment in the seat structures and mechanism business of $66 million and income tax charges to establish valuation allowances of $297 million.\nAmericas \nFiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020: The significant increase in cash used by financing activities is primarily due to the repayment of long-term debt, including premium paid, of $895 million, the prior year draw down of the ABL revolver of $179 million, and the $600 million of proceeds from the issuance of 9.00% Senior Notes in April 2020, partially offset by the $214 million incremental borrowing in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 under the amended Term Loan B Agreement.\nRestructuring and impairment charges increased by $62 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher levels of restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2020 after the industry experienced significant volume decreases resulting from the COVID-19 impact, and $53 million of one-time non-cash impairment charges of long-lived assets in China and other assets held for sale, partially offset by one-time non-cash impairment charges in the prior year related to the seat structures and mechanisms business ($66 million).\nBased on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, Adient believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased by $21 million, or 4% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. SG&A was favorably impacted by lower overall engineering and other administrative spending ($41 million), and prior year RECARO and fabrics administrative costs ($30 million), partially offset by higher stock-based compensation costs ($21 million), prior year non-recurring favorable benefits related to actions taken as described in the On-Going Impact of COVID -19 section above ($4 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($21 million), and higher transaction costs ($4 million).\nThroughout fiscal year 2020 and 2021 and into fiscal year 2022, Adient continues to actively monitor the threat and impacts of COVID-19. Adient has taken, and continues to take, steps to mitigate the potential risks to the Company posed by COVID-19 and its impacts. In addition, Adient continues to assess and update its business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic, including analyzing constraints at its customers and suppliers, particularly components and labor-related shortages, respectively. Adient has taken precautions to help keep its workforce healthy and safe, including establishing a Global Response Team, implementing strict travel restrictions, enforcing rigorous hygiene protocols, increasing sanitization efforts at all facilities, enacting visitor restrictions, social distancing, face covering expectations, and temperature and health screenings and implementing remote working arrangements for the vast majority of Adient's employees who work outside the plants.\nNet sales increased during fiscal 2021 by $301 million due to higher production volumes across the region, which was primarily a result of prior year operational interruptions due to COVID-19 and despite certain unplanned temporary production stoppages in the current year primarily resulting from semiconductor shortages ($263 million), the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($74 million), and the favorable impact of material economics recoveries ($9 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($31 million), and the impact of the prior year divestiture of RECARO ($14 million).\nAdient does not generally provide for additional income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. Adient's intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax efficient.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIncome Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nWorking capital\nEquity Income \nAdient records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Adient delivers products and records revenue pursuant to commercial agreements with its customers generally in the form of an approved purchase order, including the effects of contractual customer price productivity. Adient does negotiate discrete price changes with its customers, which are generally the result of unique commercial issues between Adient and its customers. Adient records amounts associated with discrete price changes as a reduction to revenue when specific facts and circumstances indicate that a price reduction is probable and the amounts are reasonably estimable. Adient records amounts associated with discrete price changes as an increase to revenue upon execution of a legally enforceable contractual agreement and when collectability is reasonably assured.

$547 million in fiscal 2020 due to one-time gains from sales of equity interests in China, higher volumes, and other factors. \n- Net sales were $13,680 million in fiscal 2021, an 8% increase over fiscal 2020, primarily driven by fewer COVID-19 operational interruptions.\n- Equity income was $1,484 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $22 million in fiscal 2020, largely due to gains on China transactions. \n\nResults of Operations\n- Gross profit increased to $826 million (6.0% of sales) in fiscal 2021 from $592 million (4.7% of sales) in fiscal 2020, due to higher volumes and other factors.\n- Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by 4% year-over-year.  \n- Restructuring and impairment costs decreased by $217 million, largely due to higher prior year charges.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Cash from operations increased slightly in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Investing cash flows increased due to divestiture proceeds.  \n- Long-term debt was $3.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Adient has amended debt agreements to extend maturities.\n- Working capital increased by $912 million in fiscal 2021, largely due to changes in inventory, liabilities, and receivables.\n\nThe report also discusses supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, COVID-19 impacts, forward-looking statements, and other topics related to Adient's business."}
