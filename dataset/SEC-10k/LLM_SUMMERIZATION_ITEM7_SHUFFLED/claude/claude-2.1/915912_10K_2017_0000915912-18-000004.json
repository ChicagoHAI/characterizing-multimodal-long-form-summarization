MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help provide an understanding of our business, financial condition and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this report.\nCapitalized terms used without definition have the meanings provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness Description\nOur strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select U.S. markets, providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value. We pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets, leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management. Our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets.\nWe develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California. We focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life. We believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns over the long-term on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics. We believe that the Denver, Colorado, and Southeast Florida markets share these characteristics, and we are pursuing opportunities to invest in these markets through acquisitions and developments, having acquired one operating community in each of these markets in 2017. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive.\nFinancial Highlights\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $876,921,000, a decrease of $157,081,000, or 15.2%, from the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains, coupled with increases in depreciation, loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense, and a net casualty and impairment loss in the current year compared to a gain in the prior year. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Established Communities NOI increased by $27,191,000, or 2.5%, over the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 2.5%, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 2.5% over 2016.\nDuring 2017, we raised approximately $2,320,132,000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes, sale of common shares under CEP IV and the sale of real estate. This amount does not include proceeds from joint venture dispositions and secured debt associated with the refinancing of existing secured indebtedness. The funds raised from the sale of real estate consist of the proceeds from the sale of six operating communities, three undeveloped land parcels and other real estate. We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms.\nWe believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2017, we completed the construction of 14 communities containing an aggregate of 5,189 apartment homes and 71,000 square feet of retail space, for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $1,897,000,000. We also started the construction of eight communities containing an aggregate of 2,600 apartment homes, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $808,000,000. In addition, during 2017 we completed the redevelopment of seven communities containing an aggregate of 2,072 apartment homes for a total investment of $99,000,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold six wholly-owned operating communities, containing an aggregate of 1,624 apartment homes, for an aggregate sales price of $475,500,000. We also sold other ancillary real estate including undeveloped land parcels and 421-a tax certificates representing the right to qualify for certain property tax exemptions in New York City, for an aggregate sales price $39,154,000. We recorded an aggregate gain in accordance with GAAP of $252,845,000 associated with our real estate disposition activity.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired three communities containing an aggregate of 1,062 apartment homes and 27,000 square feet of retail space for an aggregate purchase price of $365,750,000.\nWe believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets. We expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: existing cash on hand; operating cash flows; borrowings under our Credit Facility; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt, preferred equity and/or common equity); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. See the discussion under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nCommunities Overview\nAs of December 31, 2017 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 288 apartment communities containing 84,158 apartment homes in 12 states and the District of Columbia, of which 21 communities were under development and nine communities were under redevelopment. Of these communities, 12 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including six owned by the U.S. Fund, three owned by the AC JV and one that is being developed within a joint venture. In addition, we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 29 wholly-owned communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated 9,496 apartment homes.\nOur real estate investments consist primarily of Current Communities, Development Communities and Development Rights. Our Current Communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities, Redevelopment Communities and Unconsolidated Communities.\nEstablished Communities are generally consolidated communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year, allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy during the current year. Lease-Up Communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. Unconsolidated Communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 8, Segment Reporting,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAlthough each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations\u201d as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nNOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities.\nResults of Operations\nOur year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity. A comparison of our operating results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

15.2%, to $876,921,000 in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains, coupled with increases in depreciation, loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense, and a net casualty and impairment loss in the current year compared to a gain in the prior year. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities. Net income attributable to common stockholders increased $291,964,000, or 39.3%, to $1,034,002,000 in 2016 from 2015, primarily due to an increase in NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in real estate sales and related gains. These amounts were partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense, and a loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year coupled with a gain on extinguishment of debt in the prior year.\nNOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses, expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities, depreciation expense, corporate income tax expense, casualty and impairment loss (gain), net, gain on sale of communities, loss (gain) on other real estate transactions and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale.\nNOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/15\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>876,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,033,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>741,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income\n</td> <td>65,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments and investment management expense\n</td> <td>5,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries\n</td> <td>2,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>199,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt, net\n</td> <td>25,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,736\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>50,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities\n</td> <td>(70,744\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,962\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70,018\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation expense\n</td> <td>584,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>477,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty and impairment loss (gain), net\n</td> <td>6,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,935\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,542\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate assets\n</td> <td>(252,599\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(374,623\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on other real estate transactions\n</td> <td>10,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,224\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,647\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale\n</td> <td>(14,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59,383\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,490,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,383,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,215,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe NOI increases for both 2017 and 2016, as compared to the prior years, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands):\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Full Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Established Communities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Stabilized Communities (1)\n</td> <td>41,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development and Redevelopment Communities (2)\n</td> <td>37,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>NOI for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $20,306 in business interruption insurance proceeds related to the Edgewater casualty loss.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>NOI for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $3,495 in business interruption insurance proceeds related to the Maplewood casualty loss.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in our Established Communities' NOI in 2017 and 2016 is due to increased rental rates, partially offset by increased operating expenses. The increase in 2016 is also partially offset by decreased economic occupancy.\nRental and other income increased in both 2017 and 2016 compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our Established Communities. The changes between years are also impacted by business interruption insurance proceeds received due to the final settlement of the Edgewater and Maplewood casualty losses, as described above.\nConsolidated Communities-The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 70,081 apartment homes for 2017, as compared to 67,849 homes for 2016 and 64,211 homes for 2015. The weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $2,556 for 2017 as compared to $2,476 in 2016 and $2,388 in 2015.\nEstablished Communities-Rental revenue increased $38,648,000, or 2.5%, to $1,574,395,000 for 2017 from $1,535,747,000 in the prior year. The increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 2.4% to $2,511 per apartment home and an increase in economic occupancy of 0.1% to 95.5%. Rental revenue increased $64,206,000, or 4.3%, for 2016, as compared to the prior year. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents.\nWe experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our Established Communities' regions in 2017 as compared to the prior year, as discussed in more detail below.\nThe Metro New York/New Jersey region accounted for approximately 23.0% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 2.1% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 2.0% to $3,038 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 95.8% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect operating conditions in the Metro New York/New Jersey region to remain bifurcated between New York City and surrounding suburban submarkets in 2018. We believe elevated levels of new apartment deliveries in New York City are limiting our ability to increase rental rates, while surrounding suburban submarkets are more insulated from this new competition.\nThe Southern California region accounted for approximately 21.5% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 3.9% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 4.1% to $2,214 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.3% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect an increase in new apartment deliveries in Southern California in 2018 but believe strengthening job and income growth will continue to support a favorable operating environment.\nThe Northern California region accounted for approximately 21.4% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 1.6% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 1.1% to $2,839 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.5% to 95.7% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect operating conditions to remain challenged in the Northern California region in 2018 due to slower job growth and an increase in competition from new apartment deliveries.\nThe New England region accounted for approximately 14.8% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 2.4% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 2.3% to $2,420 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 95.6% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect the operating environment in New England in 2018 to be more favorable in the suburban submarkets than in the urban submarkets due to higher levels of new apartment deliveries in the urban submarkets.\nThe Mid-Atlantic region accounted for approximately 14.0% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 1.8% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 1.9% to $2,153 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.1% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.2% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We believe elevated levels of new apartment deliveries in the Mid-Atlantic region will limit our ability to increase rental rates in select submarkets in 2018.\nThe Pacific Northwest region accounted for approximately 5.3% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 5.4% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 5.2% to $2,228 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.2% to 95.2% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect strong job and income growth in 2018 in the Pacific Northwest region will continue to support a favorable operating environment.\nManagement, development and other fees decreased $1,452,000 or 25.9%, and $4,348,000, or 43.7%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The decreases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from Fund II and the U.S. Fund. The decrease in 2016 was also due to asset management and disposition fees earned in the prior year not present in 2016 from the Residual JV.\nDirect property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $21,874,000, or 5.4%, and $29,260,000, or 7.8%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities.\nFor Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $6,067,000, or 2.0%, and $7,256,000, or 2.5%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation expense, bad debt and turnover and maintenance costs, partially offset by decreased property insurance costs. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased bad debt expense, compensation and community repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by decreased utility costs and a decrease in snow removal and other costs related to the severe winter storms in our Northeast markets that occurred during the first quarter of 2015.\nProperty taxes increased $16,538,000, or 8.1%, and $11,338,000, or 5.9%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities, increased assessments across our portfolio, as well as successful appeals and reductions of supplemental taxes in the prior years in excess of those recognized in the then current year.\nFor Established Communities, property taxes increased $5,300,000, or 3.5%, and $6,616,000, or 4.4%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased assessments in the current year periods, as well as successful appeals in the prior year periods in the Company's West Coast markets. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased assessments as well as appeals and supplemental tax reversals in 2015 in excess of those recognized in 2016. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change in the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). Massachusetts also has laws in place to limit property tax increases. We evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate.\nCorporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased $2,521,000 , or 3.8%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation related costs in the current year, partially offset by severance costs in the prior year not present in current year.\nInvestments and investment management expense increased by $1,114,000, or 23.1%, and $452,000, or 10.3%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to increases in compensation expense.\nExpensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries primarily reflect abandoned pursuit costs as well as acquisition costs related to business acquisitions that occurred prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01 as of October 1, 2016. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions, and result in acquisition costs being capitalized instead of expensed. Abandoned pursuit costs include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. These aggregate costs decreased $7,186,000, or 72.4%, in 2017, and increased $3,100,000, or 45.4%, in 2016, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2017 was due to a decrease in acquisition costs related to communities acquired during the prior year periods that were expensed prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, decreased development pursuit costs, as well as the non-cash write-off of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the U.S. Fund in the prior year period in excess of amounts recognized in the current year period. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to costs related to five operating communities acquired in 2016, as well as the non-cash write-off of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the U.S. Fund.\nInterest expense, net increased $12,151,000, or 6.5%, and $11,895,000, or 6.8%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. This category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity, amortization of premium/discount on debt, and interest income. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in amounts of interest capitalized, as well as an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness. The increase in 2016 was due to an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness, as well as an increase in variable interest rates.\nLoss (gain) on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects prepayment penalties, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired. The loss of $25,472,000 for 2017 was primarily due to prepayment penalties of $33,515,000 and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $1,450,000 associated with the repayment of $556,313,000 aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mortgage notes secured by 12 wholly-owned operating communities in advance of their May 2019 maturity dates. This was partially offset by a gain of $10,839,000, primarily composed of the write-off of unamortized premium on the repayment of $670,590,000 principal amount of fixed rate mortgage notes secured by 11 wholly-owned operating communities in advance of their November 2017 maturity dates. The loss of $7,075,000 for 2016 was primarily due to the prepayment penalty associated with the early repayment of $250,000,000 principal amount of 5.70% coupon unsecured notes and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs for the variable rate debt secured by Avalon Walnut Creek.\nDepreciation expense increased $52,716,000, or 9.9%, and $53,511,000, or 11.2%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities.\nGeneral and administrative expense ( G&A\u201d) increased $4,902,000, or 10.7%, and $2,997,000, or 7.0%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses, professional fees, and sales and use tax expense. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in legal and consulting fees, as well as increased charitable contributions over the prior year.\nCasualty and impairment loss (gain), net for 2017 consists of a $9,350,000 impairment charge recognized for a land parcel we had acquired for development in 2004 and sold in July 2017, and the net impact of the Maplewood casualty loss, net of associated insurance receivables, of $2,338,000, partially offset by $5,438,000 of legal settlement proceeds relating to construction defects at a community acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. The gain for 2016 consists of $8,702,000 of property damage insurance proceeds from the final insurance settlement for the Edgewater casualty loss and $5,732,000 in net third-party insurance proceeds related to severe winter storms that occurred in 2015 in our Northeast markets. These amounts were partially offset by $10,500,000 of aggregate impairment charges recognized for ancillary land parcels.\nEquity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities increased $5,782,000, or 8.9%, and decreased $5,056,000, or 7.2%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to the recognition of income for the Company's promoted interest, partially offset by decreased gains on the sale of communities in various ventures in the current year, and decreased NOI from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2016 and 2017. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to decreased NOI from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2015 and 2016, as well as amounts received in 2015 for Avalon\nat Mission Bay II, related to a modification of the joint venture agreement to eliminate our promoted interest for future distributions, partially offset by increased gains from dispositions in 2016.\nGain on sale of communities decreased in 2017 and increased 2016 as compared to the prior years. The amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area. The gain of $252,599,000 in 2017 was primarily due to the sale of six wholly-owned operating communities, and the gain of $374,623,000 in 2016 was primarily due to the sale of seven wholly-owned operating communities.\n(Loss) gain on other real estate transactions decreased in 2017 and increased 2016 as compared to the prior years. The loss of $10,907,000 in 2017 was primarily composed of the non-cash write-off of prepaid rent associated with the purchase of land previously under a ground lease. The gain of $10,224,000 in 2016 was primarily composed of the gain on the land we sold to an unconsolidated joint venture.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $164,000 and $1,178,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the timing of federal income tax expense amounts related to dispositions of our direct and indirect interests in certain real estate assets acquired in the Archstone Acquisition, which were owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management. When we source capital, we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative then available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility. Our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>normal recurring operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $201,906,000 at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $128,071,000 from $329,977,000 at December 31, 2016. The following discussion relates to changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report.\nOperating Activities-Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $1,256,257,000 in 2017 from $1,160,272,000 in 2016. The change was driven primarily by increased NOI from existing, acquired and newly developed communities.\nInvesting Activities-Net cash used in investing activities totaled $965,381,000 in 2017. The net cash used was primarily due to:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>investment of $979,947,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>acquisition of three operating communities and land for an operating community previously encumbered by a ground lease for $462,317,000; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capital expenditures of $73,990,000 for our operating communities and non-real estate assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese amounts are partially offset by:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>proceeds from dispositions of $503,039,000; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>net distributions from unconsolidated real estate entities of $64,812,000.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities-Net cash used in financing activities totaled $418,947,000 in 2017.

We may extend the maturity for up to nine months, provided we are not in default and upon payment of a $1,500,000 extension fee. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.825% per annum (2.40% at January 31, 2018 assuming a one month borrowing rate). The annual facility fee is 0.125% (or approximately $1,875,000 annually based on the $1,500,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating).\nWe had $163,000,000 under the Credit Facility and had $46,165,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of January 31, 2018.\nFinancial Covenants\nWe are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The principal financial covenants include the following:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>minimum levels of debt service coverage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured.\nContinuous Equity Offering Program\nIn December 2015, we commenced a fourth continuous equity program ( CEP IV\u201d) under which we may sell up to $1,000,000,000 of our common stock from time to time. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. In conjunction with CEP IV, we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 2.0% of the gross sales price for shares sold. CEP IV also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements up to $1,000,000,000 in aggregate sales price of our common stock. We expect that we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. In connection with each forward sale agreement, we will pay the relevant forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, commission of up to 2.0% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. In 2017, we sold 568,424 shares at an average sales price of $188.39 per share, for net proceeds of $105,478,000. As of January 31, 2018, we had $892,915,000 of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program and no forward sales agreements outstanding.\nForward Interest Rate Swap Agreements\nIn 2017, we entered into $300,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2018, which are outstanding as of December 31, 2017. At maturity of the outstanding swap agreements, we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value. Assuming that we issue the debt as expected, the hedging impact from these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment.\nIn addition, during 2017, we settled an aggregate of $800,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements, receiving net aggregate payments of $391,000, which consisted of the following activity:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in conjunction with the refinancing of three secured borrowings in May 2017, in April 2017, we settled $185,100,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability of the secured notes, making a payment of $2,326,000;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in conjunction with our May 2017 unsecured note issuance, we settled $400,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the forecasted issuance of the unsecured notes, making a payment of $1,361,000; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in conjunction with our June 2017 unsecured note issuance, we settled $214,900,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the forecasted issuance of the unsecured notes, receiving a payment of $4,078,000.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuture Financing and Capital Needs-Debt Maturities\nOne of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at maturity. For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory.\nThe following debt activity occurred during 2017:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In February 2017, we repaid $17,300,000 of variable rate debt secured by Avalon Mountain View at par at its scheduled maturity date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In February 2017, we entered into a $250,000,000 variable rate unsecured term loan (the \"$250 million Term Loan\"), of which $100,000,000 matures in February 2022 with stated pricing of LIBOR plus 0.90%, and $150,000,000 matures in February 2024 with stated pricing of LIBOR plus 1.50%.

Additional sources of liquidity in 2018 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects.\nBefore beginning new construction or reconstruction activity, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred.\nFrom time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures.\nIn evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop, redevelop or acquire, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets. We believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs.\nUnconsolidated Real Estate Investments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nUnconsolidated Investments\nFund II was established to engage in a real estate acquisition program through a discretionary investment fund. We believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio.\nFund II has six institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II and we have an equity investment of $2,576,000 (net of distributions), representing a 31.3% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Upon achievement of a threshold return, we have a right to incentive distributions for our promoted interest representing the first 40.0% of further Fund II distributions, which are in addition to our share of the remaining 60.0% of distributions. Fund II served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in August 2011. In 2017, Fund II sold its final apartment communities. We expect to complete the dissolution of Fund II in 2018.\nDuring 2017, Fund II sold its final three communities containing 1,366 apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of $272,050,000. Our share of the gain was $26,322,000, and in addition we recognized income for our promoted interest of $26,742,000. In conjunction with the disposition of these communities, Fund II repaid the remaining $127,179,000 of secured indebtedness at par in advance of the scheduled maturity dates.\nThe U.S. Fund has six institutional investors, including us. We are the general partner of the U.S. Fund and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the U.S. Fund, we have an equity investment of $39,896,000 (net of distributions), representing a 28.6% combined equity interest. The U.S. Fund was formed in July 2011 and is fully invested. The U.S. Fund has a term that expires in July 2023, assuming the exercise of two, one-year extension options.\nDuring 2017, the U.S. Fund sold one community containing 192 apartment homes for a sales price of $107,000,000. Our share of the gain was $13,788,000. In conjunction with the disposition of this community, the U.S. Fund repaid $32,542,000 of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity date, which resulted in charges for prepayment penalties and write-offs of deferred financing costs, of which our portion was $406,000.\nThe AC JV has four institutional investors, including us. Excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the AC JV, we have an equity investment of $49,492,000 (net of distributions), representing a 20.0% equity interest. The AC JV was formed in 2011.\nDuring 2016, we entered into a joint venture to develop, own, and operate AVA North Point, an apartment community located in Cambridge, MA, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 265 apartment homes upon completion. We own a 55.0% interest in the venture, and the venture partner owns the remaining 45.0% interest. AVA North Point is the third phase of a master planned development, the other phases of which are owned through the AC JV. During 2016, we provided the partners of the AC JV the opportunity to acquire the AVA North Point land parcel we owned as required in the ROFO provisions for the AC JV. After certain partners of the AC JV declined to participate, we entered into the new joint venture and sold the land parcel to the venture in exchange for a cash payment and a capital account credit, and we are overseeing the development in exchange for a developer fee. Upon sale of the land parcel, we recognized a gain of $10,621,000. The construction of AVA North Point is expected to be completed during 2018 and, as of December 31, 2017, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of AVA North Point, we have an equity investment of $36,370,000.\nDuring 2015, we entered into a joint venture agreement to purchase land and pursue entitlements and pre-development activity for a mixed-use development project in Sudbury, MA, including multifamily apartment homes, retail, senior housing and age-restricted housing. We have a 60.0% ownership interest in the venture. During 2017, we and our joint venture partner each acquired our respective portions of the real estate held by the venture, with our portion consisting of a parcel of land acquired for an investment of $19,200,000. Along with our joint venture partner, we retain continuing involvement with the venture to fund the completion of the planned infrastructure and site work. At December 31, 2017, we recorded an obligation of $4,340,000, representing our share of costs for the venture to complete this work.\nAs part of the Archstone Acquisition we entered into a limited liability company agreement with Equity Residential, through which we assumed obligations of Archstone in the form of preferred interests, some of which are governed by tax protection arrangements (the Legacy JV\u201d). We have a 40.0% interest in the Legacy JV. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Legacy JV redeemed certain of the preferred interests and paid accrued dividends, of which our portion was $2,000,000, $1,960,000 and $14,410,000, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the remaining preferred interests had an aggregate liquidation value of $37,579,000, our share of which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets presented elsewhere in this report.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate accounted for under the equity method of accounting excluding development joint ventures and Fund II, which sold its final apartment community in 2017. Refer to Note 5, Investments in Real Estate Entities,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results.

Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 5, Investments in Real Estate Entities,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities, as referenced in the table above, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so. In the future, in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support, or take any other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve.\nThere are no other material lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest.\nContractual Obligations\nScheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,404,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>913,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,135,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,271,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Debt Obligations\n</td> <td>2,812,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>487,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,690,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations (1)\n</td> <td>1,153,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,052,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Lease Obligations (1) (2)\n</td> <td>49,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,419,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,443,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,564,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,058,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142.

In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. Similarly, in a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements\u201d as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nof 1995.

If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nWe may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting.\nWe determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate.\nIf we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at December 31, 2017, our assets would have increased by $571,578,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $534,355,000. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur:\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and we were considered the primary beneficiary.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs.\nCost Capitalization\nWe capitalize costs during the development of assets. Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue. We defer external costs associated with originating new leases, recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease.\nDuring the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project-specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $47,063,000, $45,201,000 and $43,943,000 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.\nThere may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2017 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our costs charged to expense would have increased by $4,706,000.\nWe capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense.\nDue to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If we had determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with Development Rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have decreased by $4,582,000.\nAbandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment\nWe evaluate our real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. We assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments.\nWe expense costs related to abandoned pursuits, which include the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. These costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years.\nOur focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nREIT Status\nWe are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A REIT is a corporate entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on our taxable income if we annually distribute 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to regular federal and state corporate income taxes and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2017, our net income would have decreased by approximately $352,522,000.\nOur qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate.\nAcquisition of Investments in Real Estate\nThe adoption of ASU 2017-01, as discussed in Note 1, Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report, has impacted our accounting framework for the acquisition of investments in real estate. Prior to adoption of ASU 2017-01 on October 1, 2016, we accounted for acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement, which required the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value. Typical assets and liabilities acquired include land, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above or below market leases and in-place leases. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilized various sources, including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. Consideration for acquisitions is typically in the form of cash unless otherwise disclosed. We expensed all costs incurred related to acquisitions of operating communities. Subsequent to adoption of ASU 2017-01, we assess each acquisition of an operating community to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition. We expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions, and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs, and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities.", "item_7_truncated": "The Mid-Atlantic region accounted for approximately 14.0% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 1.8% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 1.9% to $2,153 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.1% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.2% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We believe elevated levels of new apartment deliveries in the Mid-Atlantic region will limit our ability to increase rental rates in select submarkets in 2018.\n_________________________________\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

long-term debt at maturity. For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory.\nThe Pacific Northwest region accounted for approximately 5.3% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 5.4% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 5.2% to $2,228 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.2% to 95.2% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect strong job and income growth in 2018 in the Pacific Northwest region will continue to support a favorable operating environment.\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 the impact of legal proceedings relating to the Edgewater casualty loss and related matters, including liability to third parties resulting therefrom. \nWe have a $1,500,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the \"Credit Facility\") which matures in April 2020. We may extend the maturity for up to nine months, provided we are not in default and upon payment of a $1,500,000 extension fee. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.825% per annum (2.40% at January 31, 2018 assuming a one month borrowing rate). The annual facility fee is 0.125% (or approximately $1,875,000 annually based on the $1,500,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 proceeds from dispositions of $503,039,000; and \nAcquisition of Investments in Real Estate\n (1) Includes credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees' fees, the impact of interest rate hedges, offering costs, mark to market amortization and other fees. \nFuture Financing and Capital Needs-Portfolio and Capital Markets Activity\n (1) NOI for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $20,306 in business interruption insurance proceeds related to the Edgewater casualty loss. \nNOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses, expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities, depreciation expense, corporate income tax expense, casualty and impairment loss (gain), net, gain on sale of communities, loss (gain) on other real estate transactions and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale.\nFund II has six institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II and we have an equity investment of $2,576,000 (net of distributions), representing a 31.3% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Upon achievement of a threshold return, we have a right to incentive distributions for our promoted interest representing the first 40.0% of further Fund II distributions, which are in addition to our share of the remaining 60.0% of distributions. Fund II served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in August 2011. In 2017, Fund II sold its final apartment communities. We expect to complete the dissolution of Fund II in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expense ( G&A\u201d) increased $4,902,000, or 10.7%, and $2,997,000, or 7.0%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses, professional fees, and sales and use tax expense. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in legal and consulting fees, as well as increased charitable contributions over the prior year.\n (6) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. \nExecutive Overview\nCasualty and impairment loss (gain), net for 2017 consists of a $9,350,000 impairment charge recognized for a land parcel we had acquired for development in 2004 and sold in July 2017, and the net impact of the Maplewood casualty loss, net of associated insurance receivables, of $2,338,000, partially offset by $5,438,000 of legal settlement proceeds relating to construction defects at a community acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. The gain for 2016 consists of $8,702,000 of property damage insurance proceeds from the final insurance settlement for the Edgewater casualty loss and $5,732,000 in net third-party insurance proceeds related to severe winter storms that occurred in 2015 in our Northeast markets. These amounts were partially offset by $10,500,000 of aggregate impairment charges recognized for ancillary land parcels.\nDuring 2016, we entered into a joint venture to develop, own, and operate AVA North Point, an apartment community located in Cambridge, MA, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 265 apartment homes upon completion. We own a 55.0% interest in the venture, and the venture partner owns the remaining 45.0% interest. AVA North Point is the third phase of a master planned development, the other phases of which are owned through the AC JV. During 2016, we provided the partners of the AC JV the opportunity to acquire the AVA North Point land parcel we owned as required in the ROFO provisions for the AC JV. After certain partners of the AC JV declined to participate, we entered into the new joint venture and sold the land parcel to the venture in exchange for a cash payment and a capital account credit, and we are overseeing the development in exchange for a developer fee. Upon sale of the land parcel, we recognized a gain of $10,621,000. The construction of AVA North Point is expected to be completed during 2018 and, as of December 31, 2017, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of AVA North Point, we have an equity investment of $36,370,000.\n(Loss) gain on other real estate transactions decreased in 2017 and increased 2016 as compared to the prior years. The loss of $10,907,000 in 2017 was primarily composed of the non-cash write-off of prepaid rent associated with the purchase of land previously under a ground lease. The gain of $10,224,000 in 2016 was primarily composed of the gain on the land we sold to an unconsolidated joint venture.\nWe capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense.\nThe NOI increases for both 2017 and 2016, as compared to the prior years, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands):\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold six wholly-owned operating communities, containing an aggregate of 1,624 apartment homes, for an aggregate sales price of $475,500,000. We also sold other ancillary real estate including undeveloped land parcels and 421-a tax certificates representing the right to qualify for certain property tax exemptions in New York City, for an aggregate sales price $39,154,000. We recorded an aggregate gain in accordance with GAAP of $252,845,000 associated with our real estate disposition activity.\nFund II was established to engage in a real estate acquisition program through a discretionary investment fund. We believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio.\nThe U.S. Fund has six institutional investors, including us. We are the general partner of the U.S. Fund and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the U.S. Fund, we have an equity investment of $39,896,000 (net of distributions), representing a 28.6% combined equity interest. The U.S. Fund was formed in July 2011 and is fully invested. The U.S. Fund has a term that expires in July 2023, assuming the exercise of two, one-year extension options.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $201,906,000 at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $128,071,000 from $329,977,000 at December 31, 2016. The following discussion relates to changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report.\nGain on sale of communities decreased in 2017 and increased 2016 as compared to the prior years. The amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area. The gain of $252,599,000 in 2017 was primarily due to the sale of six wholly-owned operating communities, and the gain of $374,623,000 in 2016 was primarily due to the sale of seven wholly-owned operating communities.\n (7) During 2017, we repaid this borrowing in advance of its scheduled maturity date. \nResults of Operations\nDue to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If we had determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with Development Rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have decreased by $4,582,000.\nWe may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting.\n_________________________________\n \u2022 In February 2017, we repaid $17,300,000 of variable rate debt secured by Avalon Mountain View at par at its scheduled maturity date. \nOur focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\n \u2022 debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity; and \nCritical Accounting Policies\nFinancial Highlights\n \u2022 occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; \nConsolidated Communities-The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 70,081 apartment homes for 2017, as compared to 67,849 homes for 2016 and 64,211 homes for 2015. The weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $2,556 for 2017 as compared to $2,476 in 2016 and $2,388 in 2015.\n \u2022 For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and we were considered the primary beneficiary. \nIn addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 5, Investments in Real Estate Entities,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets. We expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: existing cash on hand; operating cash flows; borrowings under our Credit Facility; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt, preferred equity and/or common equity); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. See the discussion under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nWe employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management. When we source capital, we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative then available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility. Our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund:\n \u2022 minimum levels of debt service coverage. \nSubstantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. Similarly, in a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases.\nInterest expense, net increased $12,151,000, or 6.5%, and $11,895,000, or 6.8%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. This category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity, amortization of premium/discount on debt, and interest income. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in amounts of interest capitalized, as well as an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness. The increase in 2016 was due to an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness, as well as an increase in variable interest rates.\n\nContractual Obligations\nCommunities Overview\nFrom time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures.\n \u2022 proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes and borrowing under the $250 million Term Loan in the aggregate amount of $1,696,826,000; \n \u2022 our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code; \n (1) Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. \nBusiness Description\nIn addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured.\n\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements\u201d as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nat Mission Bay II, related to a modification of the joint venture agreement to eliminate our promoted interest for future distributions, partially offset by increased gains from dispositions in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $876,921,000, a decrease of $157,081,000, or 15.2%, from the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains, coupled with increases in depreciation, loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense, and a net casualty and impairment loss in the current year compared to a gain in the prior year. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities.\n \u2022 we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses; \n \u2022 In October 2017, we refinanced the secured borrowing of Archstone Lexington for a principal balance of $21,700,000, with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.35% and maturity date of October 2020. \nIn addition, during 2017, we settled an aggregate of $800,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements, receiving net aggregate payments of $391,000, which consisted of the following activity:\n \u2022 development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; \n \u2022 capital expenditures of $73,990,000 for our operating communities and non-real estate assets. \n \u2022 our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; \nBefore beginning new construction or reconstruction activity, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred.\nContinuous Equity Offering Program\n \u2022 trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; and \nFor Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $6,067,000, or 2.0%, and $7,256,000, or 2.5%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation expense, bad debt and turnover and maintenance costs, partially offset by decreased property insurance costs. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased bad debt expense, compensation and community repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by decreased utility costs and a decrease in snow removal and other costs related to the severe winter storms in our Northeast markets that occurred during the first quarter of 2015.\nOur strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select U.S. markets, providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value. We pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets, leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management. Our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets.\nThe Metro New York/New Jersey region accounted for approximately 23.0% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 2.1% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 2.0% to $3,038 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 95.8% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect operating conditions in the Metro New York/New Jersey region to remain bifurcated between New York City and surrounding suburban submarkets in 2018. We believe elevated levels of new apartment deliveries in New York City are limiting our ability to increase rental rates, while surrounding suburban submarkets are more insulated from this new competition.\nIn evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop, redevelop or acquire, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets. We believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs.\nWe are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A REIT is a corporate entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on our taxable income if we annually distribute 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to regular federal and state corporate income taxes and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2017, our net income would have decreased by approximately $352,522,000.\nOur year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity. A comparison of our operating results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 follows (dollars in thousands):\nCorporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased $2,521,000 , or 3.8%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation related costs in the current year, partially offset by severance costs in the prior year not present in current year.\n\nWe evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs.\n \u2022 in conjunction with our May 2017 unsecured note issuance, we settled $400,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the forecasted issuance of the unsecured notes, making a payment of $1,361,000; and \n \u2022 we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; \n_________________________________\n \u2022 in conjunction with our June 2017 unsecured note issuance, we settled $214,900,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the forecasted issuance of the unsecured notes, receiving a payment of $4,078,000. \n \u2022 In November 2017, we repaid our $300,000,000 variable rate unsecured term loan (the \"$300 million Term Loan\") entered into in March 2014. In conjunction with the repayment, we recognized a charge of $1,367,000 for the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs. \nWe are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The principal financial covenants include the following:\n \u2022 the repayment of the $300 million Term Loan. \n \u2022 In May 2017, we repaid $670,590,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.26% fixed rate secured notes secured by 11 communities, representing the majority of the Fannie Mae pool 2 secured indebtedness assumed as part of the Archstone Acquisition, which had a contractual maturity date of November 2017 but opened for prepayment at par on April 30, 2017. In conjunction with the repayment, we recognized a gain of $10,839,000, primarily composed of the write-off of unamortized premium. We refinanced the secured borrowings for three of these communities for an aggregate principal amount of $185,100,000, with a contractual fixed interest rate of 3.61% and maturity dates of June 2027. \nCost Capitalization\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help provide an understanding of our business, financial condition and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this report.\n \u2022 the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; \n \u2022 the repayment of secured notes in the amount of $1,313,025,000; \nWe capitalize costs during the development of assets. Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue. We defer external costs associated with originating new leases, recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease.\n (2) Aggregate capital lease payments include $25,961 in interest costs. \n (4) Borrowing on this community is a variable rate loan which has been converted to a fixed rate borrowing with an interest rate swap. \nREIT Status\nnot rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Established Communities NOI increased by $27,191,000, or 2.5%, over the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 2.5%, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 2.5% over 2016.\nEquity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities increased $5,782,000, or 8.9%, and decreased $5,056,000, or 7.2%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to the recognition of income for the Company's promoted interest, partially offset by decreased gains on the sale of communities in various ventures in the current year, and decreased NOI from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2016 and 2017. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to decreased NOI from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2015 and 2016, as well as amounts received in 2015 for Avalon\n \u2022 In June 2017, we issued $300,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $297,372,000. The notes mature in July 2047 and were issued at a 4.15% interest rate. \n \u2022 construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; \n\nVariable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility\nDuring 2015, we entered into a joint venture agreement to purchase land and pursue entitlements and pre-development activity for a mixed-use development project in Sudbury, MA, including multifamily apartment homes, retail, senior housing and age-restricted housing. We have a 60.0% ownership interest in the venture. During 2017, we and our joint venture partner each acquired our respective portions of the real estate held by the venture, with our portion consisting of a parcel of land acquired for an investment of $19,200,000. Along with our joint venture partner, we retain continuing involvement with the venture to fund the completion of the planned infrastructure and site work. At December 31, 2017, we recorded an obligation of $4,340,000, representing our share of costs for the venture to complete this work.\n \u2022 our expectations, estimates and assumptions as of the date of this filing regarding the outcome of investigations and/or legal proceedings resulting from the Edgewater casualty loss, are subject to change. \nFuture Financing and Capital Needs-Debt Maturities\n \u2022 financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; \nPrinciples of Consolidation\n (1) Represents total capitalized cost as of December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; \nForward-Looking Statements\n \u2022 we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition; and \nUnconsolidated Investments\n\n \u2022 In November 2017, we issued $300,000,000 principal amount of floating rate unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $298,800,000. The notes mature in January 2021 and were issued at three month LIBOR plus 0.43%. \nInflation and Deflation\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate accounted for under the equity method of accounting excluding development joint ventures and Fund II, which sold its final apartment community in 2017. Refer to Note 5, Investments in Real Estate Entities,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. For ventures holding operating apartment communities as of December 31, 2017, detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table (dollars in thousands).\nAs part of the Archstone Acquisition we entered into a limited liability company agreement with Equity Residential, through which we assumed obligations of Archstone in the form of preferred interests, some of which are governed by tax protection arrangements (the Legacy JV\u201d). We have a 40.0% interest in the Legacy JV. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Legacy JV redeemed certain of the preferred interests and paid accrued dividends, of which our portion was $2,000,000, $1,960,000 and $14,410,000, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the remaining preferred interests had an aggregate liquidation value of $37,579,000, our share of which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets presented elsewhere in this report.\nScheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nAlthough each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations\u201d as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\n \u2022 acquisition of three operating communities and land for an operating community previously encumbered by a ground lease for $462,317,000; and \n (5) In February 2017, we repaid this borrowing at par at its scheduled maturity date. \n \u2022 interest rates; \nExpensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries primarily reflect abandoned pursuit costs as well as acquisition costs related to business acquisitions that occurred prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01 as of October 1, 2016. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions, and result in acquisition costs being capitalized instead of expensed. Abandoned pursuit costs include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. These aggregate costs decreased $7,186,000, or 72.4%, in 2017, and increased $3,100,000, or 45.4%, in 2016, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2017 was due to a decrease in acquisition costs related to communities acquired during the prior year periods that were expensed prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, decreased development pursuit costs, as well as the non-cash write-off of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the U.S. Fund in the prior year period in excess of amounts recognized in the current year period. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to costs related to five operating communities acquired in 2016, as well as the non-cash write-off of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the U.S. Fund.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017.\nOur qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate.\nLoss (gain) on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects prepayment penalties, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired. The loss of $25,472,000 for 2017 was primarily due to prepayment penalties of $33,515,000 and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $1,450,000 associated with the repayment of $556,313,000 aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mortgage notes secured by 12 wholly-owned operating communities in advance of their May 2019 maturity dates. This was partially offset by a gain of $10,839,000, primarily composed of the write-off of unamortized premium on the repayment of $670,590,000 principal amount of fixed rate mortgage notes secured by 11 wholly-owned operating communities in advance of their November 2017 maturity dates. The loss of $7,075,000 for 2016 was primarily due to the prepayment penalty associated with the early repayment of $250,000,000 principal amount of 5.70% coupon unsecured notes and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs for the variable rate debt secured by Avalon Walnut Creek.\nDuring 2017, Fund II sold its final three communities containing 1,366 apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of $272,050,000. Our share of the gain was $26,322,000, and in addition we recognized income for our promoted interest of $26,742,000. In conjunction with the disposition of these communities, Fund II repaid the remaining $127,179,000 of secured indebtedness at par in advance of the scheduled maturity dates.\nThe Northern California region accounted for approximately 21.4% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 1.6% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 1.1% to $2,839 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.5% to 95.7% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect operating conditions to remain challenged in the Northern California region in 2018 due to slower job growth and an increase in competition from new apartment deliveries.\n \u2022 the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; \nDuring the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project-specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $47,063,000, $45,201,000 and $43,943,000 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.\n \u2022 our declaration or payment of dividends; \nWe cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired three communities containing an aggregate of 1,062 apartment homes and 27,000 square feet of retail space for an aggregate purchase price of $365,750,000.\n \u2022 For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. \nWe evaluate our real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. We assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments.\nCapitalized terms used without definition have the meanings provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n (2) Balances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity, and exclude deferred financing costs and debt discount for the unsecured notes of $47,236 and $36,698 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, deferred financing costs and debt discount associated with secured notes of $27,607 as of December 31, 2017, and deferred financing costs net of premium of $9,180 as of December 31, 2016, as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. \nIn 2018, we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, including (i) real estate dispositions, (ii) cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities, (iii) borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and (iv) secured and unsecured debt financings. Additional sources of liquidity in 2018 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects.\n \u2022 the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; \n \u2022 the anticipated operating performance of our communities; \n\nThe AC JV has four institutional investors, including us. Excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the AC JV, we have an equity investment of $49,492,000 (net of distributions), representing a 20.0% equity interest. The AC JV was formed in 2011.\nWe experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our Established Communities' regions in 2017 as compared to the prior year, as discussed in more detail below.\n (4) Maturity date reflects the contractual maturity of the underlying bond. There is also an associated earlier credit enhancement maturity date. \nThe increase in our Established Communities' NOI in 2017 and 2016 is due to increased rental rates, partially offset by increased operating expenses. The increase in 2016 is also partially offset by decreased economic occupancy.\n \u2022 In November 2017, we issued $450,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $445,271,000. The notes mature in January 2028 and were issued at a 3.20% coupon. \nNOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities.\n \u2022 our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; \nFor Established Communities, property taxes increased $5,300,000, or 3.5%, and $6,616,000, or 4.4%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased assessments in the current year periods, as well as successful appeals in the prior year periods in the Company's West Coast markets. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased assessments as well as appeals and supplemental tax reversals in 2015 in excess of those recognized in 2016. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change in the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). Massachusetts also has laws in place to limit property tax increases. We evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate.\n \u2022 In June 2017, we repaid $556,313,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.86% fixed rate secured notes secured by 12 wholly-owned operating communities, representing the remaining debt in the Freddie Mac cross-collateralized pool financing originated in 2009, in advance of their May 2019 maturity date. In conjunction with the repayment, we recognized a charge of $34,965,000, consisting of prepayment penalties of $33,515,000 and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $1,450,000. \nProperty taxes increased $16,538,000, or 8.1%, and $11,338,000, or 5.9%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities, increased assessments across our portfolio, as well as successful appeals and reductions of supplemental taxes in the prior years in excess of those recognized in the then current year.\nOur real estate investments consist primarily of Current Communities, Development Communities and Development Rights. Our Current Communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities, Redevelopment Communities and Unconsolidated Communities.\nof 1995.

These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to:\n \u2022 in conjunction with the refinancing of three secured borrowings in May 2017, in April 2017, we settled $185,100,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability of the secured notes, making a payment of $2,326,000; \n \u2022 the issuance of common stock in the amount of $111,093,000, primarily through CEP IV. \nWe determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate.\nRental and other income increased in both 2017 and 2016 compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our Established Communities. The changes between years are also impacted by business interruption insurance proceeds received due to the final settlement of the Edgewater and Maplewood casualty losses, as described above.\nInvestments and investment management expense increased by $1,114,000, or 23.1%, and $452,000, or 10.3%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to increases in compensation expense.\nThe following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands). We are not directly or indirectly (as borrower or guarantor) obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest.\n (2) NOI for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $3,495 in business interruption insurance proceeds related to the Maplewood casualty loss. \nNOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDuring 2017, we raised approximately $2,320,132,000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes, sale of common shares under CEP IV and the sale of real estate. This amount does not include proceeds from joint venture dispositions and secured debt associated with the refinancing of existing secured indebtedness. The funds raised from the sale of real estate consist of the proceeds from the sale of six operating communities, three undeveloped land parcels and other real estate. We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms.\nWe develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California. We focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life. We believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns over the long-term on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics. We believe that the Denver, Colorado, and Southeast Florida markets share these characteristics, and we are pursuing opportunities to invest in these markets through acquisitions and developments, having acquired one operating community in each of these markets in 2017. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive.\nWe have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities, as referenced in the table above, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so. In the future, in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support, or take any other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve.\n \u2022 investment of $979,947,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities; \nFinancial Covenants\n \u2022 payment of cash dividends in the amount of $772,657,000; and \n \u2022 our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; \n (5) Borrowing is comprised of loans made by the equity investors in the venture in proportion to their equity interests. \n \u2022 normal recurring operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses. \nNet income attributable to common stockholders decreased $157,081,000, or 15.2%, to $876,921,000 in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains, coupled with increases in depreciation, loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense, and a net casualty and impairment loss in the current year compared to a gain in the prior year. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities. Net income attributable to common stockholders increased $291,964,000, or 39.3%, to $1,034,002,000 in 2016 from 2015, primarily due to an increase in NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in real estate sales and related gains. These amounts were partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense, and a loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year coupled with a gain on extinguishment of debt in the prior year.\nFinancing Activities-Net cash used in financing activities totaled $418,947,000 in 2017. The net cash used was primarily due to:\n (3) In February 2018, we repaid this borrowing in advance of its scheduled maturity date, incurring a prepayment penalty of $152. \nThe adoption of ASU 2017-01, as discussed in Note 1, Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report, has impacted our accounting framework for the acquisition of investments in real estate. Prior to adoption of ASU 2017-01 on October 1, 2016, we accounted for acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement, which required the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value. Typical assets and liabilities acquired include land, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above or below market leases and in-place leases. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilized various sources, including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. Consideration for acquisitions is typically in the form of cash unless otherwise disclosed. We expensed all costs incurred related to acquisitions of operating communities. Subsequent to adoption of ASU 2017-01, we assess each acquisition of an operating community to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition. We expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions, and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs, and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities.\nThe Southern California region accounted for approximately 21.5% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 3.9% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 4.1% to $2,214 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.3% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect an increase in new apartment deliveries in Southern California in 2018 but believe strengthening job and income growth will continue to support a favorable operating environment.\n \u2022 In May 2017, we issued $400,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $396,016,000. The notes mature in May 2027 and were issued at a 3.35% interest rate. \n_________________________________\n \u2022 In February 2017, we entered into a $250,000,000 variable rate unsecured term loan (the \"$250 million Term Loan\"), of which $100,000,000 matures in February 2022 with stated pricing of LIBOR plus 0.90%, and $150,000,000 matures in February 2024 with stated pricing of LIBOR plus 1.50%. In April 2017, we drew the $250,000,000 available under the $250 million Term Loan. \nEstablished Communities-Rental revenue increased $38,648,000, or 2.5%, to $1,574,395,000 for 2017 from $1,535,747,000 in the prior year. The increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 2.4% to $2,511 per apartment home and an increase in economic occupancy of 0.1% to 95.5%. Rental revenue increased $64,206,000, or 4.3%, for 2016, as compared to the prior year. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents.\nFactors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs.\nIf we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at December 31, 2017, our assets would have increased by $571,578,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $534,355,000. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur:\nWe believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2017, we completed the construction of 14 communities containing an aggregate of 5,189 apartment homes and 71,000 square feet of retail space, for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $1,897,000,000. We also started the construction of eight communities containing an aggregate of 2,600 apartment homes, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $808,000,000. In addition, during 2017 we completed the redevelopment of seven communities containing an aggregate of 2,072 apartment homes for a total investment of $99,000,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $164,000 and $1,178,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the timing of federal income tax expense amounts related to dispositions of our direct and indirect interests in certain real estate assets acquired in the Archstone Acquisition, which were owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary.\nInvesting Activities-Net cash used in investing activities totaled $965,381,000 in 2017. The net cash used was primarily due to:\nIn December 2015, we commenced a fourth continuous equity program ( CEP IV\u201d) under which we may sell up to $1,000,000,000 of our common stock from time to time. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. In conjunction with CEP IV, we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 2.0% of the gross sales price for shares sold. CEP IV also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements up to $1,000,000,000 in aggregate sales price of our common stock. We expect that we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. In connection with each forward sale agreement, we will pay the relevant forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, commission of up to 2.0% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. In 2017, we sold 568,424 shares at an average sales price of $188.39 per share, for net proceeds of $105,478,000. As of January 31, 2018, we had $892,915,000 of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program and no forward sales agreements outstanding.\n (8) During 2017, we repaid a borrowing secured by this community and subsequently refinanced the secured borrowing. \nThe following debt activity occurred during 2017:\nEstablished Communities are generally consolidated communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year, allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy during the current year. Lease-Up Communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. Unconsolidated Communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 8, Segment Reporting,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe expense costs related to abandoned pursuits, which include the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. These costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years.\n_________________________________\nThese amounts are partially offset by:\n \u2022 we may be unsuccessful in our management of the U.S. Fund, the AC JV or the REIT vehicles that are used with each respective joint venture; \n (2) We have not guaranteed the debt of unconsolidated investees and bear no responsibility for the repayment. \nDuring 2017, the U.S. Fund sold one community containing 192 apartment homes for a sales price of $107,000,000. Our share of the gain was $13,788,000. In conjunction with the disposition of this community, the U.S. Fund repaid $32,542,000 of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity date, which resulted in charges for prepayment penalties and write-offs of deferred financing costs, of which our portion was $406,000.\n \u2022 we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; \n \u2022 the availability of debt and equity financing; \n \u2022 the issuance of secured notes in the amount of $206,800,000; and \n \u2022 net distributions from unconsolidated real estate entities of $64,812,000. \nThere may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2017 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our costs charged to expense would have increased by $4,706,000.\nAs of December 31, 2017 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 288 apartment communities containing 84,158 apartment homes in 12 states and the District of Columbia, of which 21 communities were under development and nine communities were under redevelopment. Of these communities, 12 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including six owned by the U.S. Fund, three owned by the AC JV and one that is being developed within a joint venture. In addition, we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 29 wholly-owned communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated 9,496 apartment homes.\nIn 2017, we entered into $300,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2018, which are outstanding as of December 31, 2017. At maturity of the outstanding swap agreements, we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value. Assuming that we issue the debt as expected, the hedging impact from these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment.\nThese amounts are partially offset by:\nForward Interest Rate Swap Agreements\nDirect property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $21,874,000, or 5.4%, and $29,260,000, or 7.8%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities.\n \u2022 the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code; \nWe had $163,000,000 under the Credit Facility and had $46,165,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of January 31, 2018.", "item_7_text": "The Mid-Atlantic region accounted for approximately 14.0% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 1.8% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 1.9% to $2,153 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.1% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.2% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We believe elevated levels of new apartment deliveries in the Mid-Atlantic region will limit our ability to increase rental rates in select submarkets in 2018.\n_________________________________\nSome of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:\nUnconsolidated Real Estate Investments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOne of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at maturity. For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory.\nThe Pacific Northwest region accounted for approximately 5.3% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 5.4% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 5.2% to $2,228 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.2% to 95.2% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect strong job and income growth in 2018 in the Pacific Northwest region will continue to support a favorable operating environment.\n (1) Percent change is not meaningful. \nOperating Activities-Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $1,256,257,000 in 2017 from $1,160,272,000 in 2016. The change was driven primarily by increased NOI from existing, acquired and newly developed communities.\nThe New England region accounted for approximately 14.8% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 2.4% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 2.3% to $2,420 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 95.6% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect the operating environment in New England in 2018 to be more favorable in the suburban submarkets than in the urban submarkets due to higher levels of new apartment deliveries in the urban submarkets.\nDepreciation expense increased $52,716,000, or 9.9%, and $53,511,000, or 11.2%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities.\nAbandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment\n (3) Represents weighted average rate on outstanding debt as of December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; \n \u2022 limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure; \n \u2022 cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates; \nThere are no other material lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us.

The decreases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from Fund II and the U.S. Fund. The decrease in 2016 was also due to asset management and disposition fees earned in the prior year not present in 2016 from the Residual JV.\n \u2022 general economic conditions including the potential impacts from current economic conditions; \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 the impact of legal proceedings relating to the Edgewater casualty loss and related matters, including liability to third parties resulting therefrom. \nWe have a $1,500,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the \"Credit Facility\") which matures in April 2020. We may extend the maturity for up to nine months, provided we are not in default and upon payment of a $1,500,000 extension fee. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.825% per annum (2.40% at January 31, 2018 assuming a one month borrowing rate). The annual facility fee is 0.125% (or approximately $1,875,000 annually based on the $1,500,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 proceeds from dispositions of $503,039,000; and \nAcquisition of Investments in Real Estate\n (1) Includes credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees' fees, the impact of interest rate hedges, offering costs, mark to market amortization and other fees. \nFuture Financing and Capital Needs-Portfolio and Capital Markets Activity\n (1) NOI for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $20,306 in business interruption insurance proceeds related to the Edgewater casualty loss. \nNOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses, expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities, depreciation expense, corporate income tax expense, casualty and impairment loss (gain), net, gain on sale of communities, loss (gain) on other real estate transactions and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale.\nFund II has six institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II and we have an equity investment of $2,576,000 (net of distributions), representing a 31.3% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Upon achievement of a threshold return, we have a right to incentive distributions for our promoted interest representing the first 40.0% of further Fund II distributions, which are in addition to our share of the remaining 60.0% of distributions. Fund II served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in August 2011. In 2017, Fund II sold its final apartment communities. We expect to complete the dissolution of Fund II in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expense ( G&A\u201d) increased $4,902,000, or 10.7%, and $2,997,000, or 7.0%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses, professional fees, and sales and use tax expense. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in legal and consulting fees, as well as increased charitable contributions over the prior year.\n (6) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. \nExecutive Overview\nCasualty and impairment loss (gain), net for 2017 consists of a $9,350,000 impairment charge recognized for a land parcel we had acquired for development in 2004 and sold in July 2017, and the net impact of the Maplewood casualty loss, net of associated insurance receivables, of $2,338,000, partially offset by $5,438,000 of legal settlement proceeds relating to construction defects at a community acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. The gain for 2016 consists of $8,702,000 of property damage insurance proceeds from the final insurance settlement for the Edgewater casualty loss and $5,732,000 in net third-party insurance proceeds related to severe winter storms that occurred in 2015 in our Northeast markets. These amounts were partially offset by $10,500,000 of aggregate impairment charges recognized for ancillary land parcels.\nDuring 2016, we entered into a joint venture to develop, own, and operate AVA North Point, an apartment community located in Cambridge, MA, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 265 apartment homes upon completion. We own a 55.0% interest in the venture, and the venture partner owns the remaining 45.0% interest. AVA North Point is the third phase of a master planned development, the other phases of which are owned through the AC JV. During 2016, we provided the partners of the AC JV the opportunity to acquire the AVA North Point land parcel we owned as required in the ROFO provisions for the AC JV. After certain partners of the AC JV declined to participate, we entered into the new joint venture and sold the land parcel to the venture in exchange for a cash payment and a capital account credit, and we are overseeing the development in exchange for a developer fee. Upon sale of the land parcel, we recognized a gain of $10,621,000. The construction of AVA North Point is expected to be completed during 2018 and, as of December 31, 2017, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of AVA North Point, we have an equity investment of $36,370,000.\n(Loss) gain on other real estate transactions decreased in 2017 and increased 2016 as compared to the prior years. The loss of $10,907,000 in 2017 was primarily composed of the non-cash write-off of prepaid rent associated with the purchase of land previously under a ground lease. The gain of $10,224,000 in 2016 was primarily composed of the gain on the land we sold to an unconsolidated joint venture.\nWe capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense.\nThe NOI increases for both 2017 and 2016, as compared to the prior years, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands):\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold six wholly-owned operating communities, containing an aggregate of 1,624 apartment homes, for an aggregate sales price of $475,500,000. We also sold other ancillary real estate including undeveloped land parcels and 421-a tax certificates representing the right to qualify for certain property tax exemptions in New York City, for an aggregate sales price $39,154,000. We recorded an aggregate gain in accordance with GAAP of $252,845,000 associated with our real estate disposition activity.\nFund II was established to engage in a real estate acquisition program through a discretionary investment fund. We believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio.\nThe U.S. Fund has six institutional investors, including us. We are the general partner of the U.S. Fund and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the U.S. Fund, we have an equity investment of $39,896,000 (net of distributions), representing a 28.6% combined equity interest. The U.S. Fund was formed in July 2011 and is fully invested. The U.S. Fund has a term that expires in July 2023, assuming the exercise of two, one-year extension options.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $201,906,000 at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $128,071,000 from $329,977,000 at December 31, 2016. The following discussion relates to changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report.\nGain on sale of communities decreased in 2017 and increased 2016 as compared to the prior years. The amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area. The gain of $252,599,000 in 2017 was primarily due to the sale of six wholly-owned operating communities, and the gain of $374,623,000 in 2016 was primarily due to the sale of seven wholly-owned operating communities.\n (7) During 2017, we repaid this borrowing in advance of its scheduled maturity date. \nResults of Operations\nDue to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If we had determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with Development Rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have decreased by $4,582,000.\nWe may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting.\n_________________________________\n \u2022 In February 2017, we repaid $17,300,000 of variable rate debt secured by Avalon Mountain View at par at its scheduled maturity date. \nOur focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\n \u2022 debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity; and \nCritical Accounting Policies\nFinancial Highlights\n \u2022 occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; \nConsolidated Communities-The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 70,081 apartment homes for 2017, as compared to 67,849 homes for 2016 and 64,211 homes for 2015. The weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $2,556 for 2017 as compared to $2,476 in 2016 and $2,388 in 2015.\n \u2022 For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and we were considered the primary beneficiary. \nIn addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 5, Investments in Real Estate Entities,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets. We expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: existing cash on hand; operating cash flows; borrowings under our Credit Facility; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt, preferred equity and/or common equity); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. See the discussion under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nWe employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management. When we source capital, we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative then available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility. Our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund:\n \u2022 minimum levels of debt service coverage. \nSubstantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. Similarly, in a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases.\nInterest expense, net increased $12,151,000, or 6.5%, and $11,895,000, or 6.8%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. This category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity, amortization of premium/discount on debt, and interest income. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in amounts of interest capitalized, as well as an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness. The increase in 2016 was due to an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness, as well as an increase in variable interest rates.\n\nContractual Obligations\nCommunities Overview\nFrom time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures.\n \u2022 proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes and borrowing under the $250 million Term Loan in the aggregate amount of $1,696,826,000; \n \u2022 our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code; \n (1) Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. \nBusiness Description\nIn addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured.\n\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements\u201d as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nat Mission Bay II, related to a modification of the joint venture agreement to eliminate our promoted interest for future distributions, partially offset by increased gains from dispositions in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $876,921,000, a decrease of $157,081,000, or 15.2%, from the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains, coupled with increases in depreciation, loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense, and a net casualty and impairment loss in the current year compared to a gain in the prior year. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities.\n \u2022 we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses; \n \u2022 In October 2017, we refinanced the secured borrowing of Archstone Lexington for a principal balance of $21,700,000, with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.35% and maturity date of October 2020. \nIn addition, during 2017, we settled an aggregate of $800,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements, receiving net aggregate payments of $391,000, which consisted of the following activity:\n \u2022 development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; \n \u2022 capital expenditures of $73,990,000 for our operating communities and non-real estate assets. \n \u2022 our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; \nBefore beginning new construction or reconstruction activity, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred.\nContinuous Equity Offering Program\n \u2022 trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; and \nFor Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $6,067,000, or 2.0%, and $7,256,000, or 2.5%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation expense, bad debt and turnover and maintenance costs, partially offset by decreased property insurance costs. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased bad debt expense, compensation and community repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by decreased utility costs and a decrease in snow removal and other costs related to the severe winter storms in our Northeast markets that occurred during the first quarter of 2015.\nOur strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select U.S. markets, providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value. We pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets, leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management. Our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets.\nThe Metro New York/New Jersey region accounted for approximately 23.0% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 2.1% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 2.0% to $3,038 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 95.8% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect operating conditions in the Metro New York/New Jersey region to remain bifurcated between New York City and surrounding suburban submarkets in 2018. We believe elevated levels of new apartment deliveries in New York City are limiting our ability to increase rental rates, while surrounding suburban submarkets are more insulated from this new competition.\nIn evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop, redevelop or acquire, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets. We believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs.\nWe are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A REIT is a corporate entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on our taxable income if we annually distribute 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to regular federal and state corporate income taxes and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2017, our net income would have decreased by approximately $352,522,000.\nOur year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity. A comparison of our operating results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 follows (dollars in thousands):\nCorporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased $2,521,000 , or 3.8%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation related costs in the current year, partially offset by severance costs in the prior year not present in current year.\n\nWe evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs.\n \u2022 in conjunction with our May 2017 unsecured note issuance, we settled $400,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the forecasted issuance of the unsecured notes, making a payment of $1,361,000; and \n \u2022 we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; \n_________________________________\n \u2022 in conjunction with our June 2017 unsecured note issuance, we settled $214,900,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the forecasted issuance of the unsecured notes, receiving a payment of $4,078,000. \n \u2022 In November 2017, we repaid our $300,000,000 variable rate unsecured term loan (the \"$300 million Term Loan\") entered into in March 2014. In conjunction with the repayment, we recognized a charge of $1,367,000 for the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs. \nWe are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The principal financial covenants include the following:\n \u2022 the repayment of the $300 million Term Loan. \n \u2022 In May 2017, we repaid $670,590,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.26% fixed rate secured notes secured by 11 communities, representing the majority of the Fannie Mae pool 2 secured indebtedness assumed as part of the Archstone Acquisition, which had a contractual maturity date of November 2017 but opened for prepayment at par on April 30, 2017. In conjunction with the repayment, we recognized a gain of $10,839,000, primarily composed of the write-off of unamortized premium. We refinanced the secured borrowings for three of these communities for an aggregate principal amount of $185,100,000, with a contractual fixed interest rate of 3.61% and maturity dates of June 2027. \nCost Capitalization\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help provide an understanding of our business, financial condition and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this report.\n \u2022 the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; \n \u2022 the repayment of secured notes in the amount of $1,313,025,000; \nWe capitalize costs during the development of assets. Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue. We defer external costs associated with originating new leases, recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease.\n (2) Aggregate capital lease payments include $25,961 in interest costs. \n (4) Borrowing on this community is a variable rate loan which has been converted to a fixed rate borrowing with an interest rate swap. \nREIT Status\nnot rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Established Communities NOI increased by $27,191,000, or 2.5%, over the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 2.5%, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 2.5% over 2016.\nEquity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities increased $5,782,000, or 8.9%, and decreased $5,056,000, or 7.2%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to the recognition of income for the Company's promoted interest, partially offset by decreased gains on the sale of communities in various ventures in the current year, and decreased NOI from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2016 and 2017. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to decreased NOI from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2015 and 2016, as well as amounts received in 2015 for Avalon\n \u2022 In June 2017, we issued $300,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $297,372,000. The notes mature in July 2047 and were issued at a 4.15% interest rate. \n \u2022 construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; \n\nVariable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility\nDuring 2015, we entered into a joint venture agreement to purchase land and pursue entitlements and pre-development activity for a mixed-use development project in Sudbury, MA, including multifamily apartment homes, retail, senior housing and age-restricted housing. We have a 60.0% ownership interest in the venture. During 2017, we and our joint venture partner each acquired our respective portions of the real estate held by the venture, with our portion consisting of a parcel of land acquired for an investment of $19,200,000. Along with our joint venture partner, we retain continuing involvement with the venture to fund the completion of the planned infrastructure and site work. At December 31, 2017, we recorded an obligation of $4,340,000, representing our share of costs for the venture to complete this work.\n \u2022 our expectations, estimates and assumptions as of the date of this filing regarding the outcome of investigations and/or legal proceedings resulting from the Edgewater casualty loss, are subject to change. \nFuture Financing and Capital Needs-Debt Maturities\n \u2022 financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; \nPrinciples of Consolidation\n (1) Represents total capitalized cost as of December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; \nForward-Looking Statements\n \u2022 we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition; and \nUnconsolidated Investments\n\n \u2022 In November 2017, we issued $300,000,000 principal amount of floating rate unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $298,800,000. The notes mature in January 2021 and were issued at three month LIBOR plus 0.43%. \nInflation and Deflation\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate accounted for under the equity method of accounting excluding development joint ventures and Fund II, which sold its final apartment community in 2017. Refer to Note 5, Investments in Real Estate Entities,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. For ventures holding operating apartment communities as of December 31, 2017, detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table (dollars in thousands).\nAs part of the Archstone Acquisition we entered into a limited liability company agreement with Equity Residential, through which we assumed obligations of Archstone in the form of preferred interests, some of which are governed by tax protection arrangements (the Legacy JV\u201d). We have a 40.0% interest in the Legacy JV. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Legacy JV redeemed certain of the preferred interests and paid accrued dividends, of which our portion was $2,000,000, $1,960,000 and $14,410,000, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the remaining preferred interests had an aggregate liquidation value of $37,579,000, our share of which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets presented elsewhere in this report.\nScheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nAlthough each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations\u201d as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\n \u2022 acquisition of three operating communities and land for an operating community previously encumbered by a ground lease for $462,317,000; and \n (5) In February 2017, we repaid this borrowing at par at its scheduled maturity date. \n \u2022 interest rates; \nExpensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries primarily reflect abandoned pursuit costs as well as acquisition costs related to business acquisitions that occurred prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01 as of October 1, 2016. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions, and result in acquisition costs being capitalized instead of expensed. Abandoned pursuit costs include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. These aggregate costs decreased $7,186,000, or 72.4%, in 2017, and increased $3,100,000, or 45.4%, in 2016, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2017 was due to a decrease in acquisition costs related to communities acquired during the prior year periods that were expensed prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, decreased development pursuit costs, as well as the non-cash write-off of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the U.S. Fund in the prior year period in excess of amounts recognized in the current year period. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to costs related to five operating communities acquired in 2016, as well as the non-cash write-off of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the U.S. Fund.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017.\nOur qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate.\nLoss (gain) on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects prepayment penalties, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired. The loss of $25,472,000 for 2017 was primarily due to prepayment penalties of $33,515,000 and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $1,450,000 associated with the repayment of $556,313,000 aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mortgage notes secured by 12 wholly-owned operating communities in advance of their May 2019 maturity dates. This was partially offset by a gain of $10,839,000, primarily composed of the write-off of unamortized premium on the repayment of $670,590,000 principal amount of fixed rate mortgage notes secured by 11 wholly-owned operating communities in advance of their November 2017 maturity dates. The loss of $7,075,000 for 2016 was primarily due to the prepayment penalty associated with the early repayment of $250,000,000 principal amount of 5.70% coupon unsecured notes and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs for the variable rate debt secured by Avalon Walnut Creek.\nDuring 2017, Fund II sold its final three communities containing 1,366 apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of $272,050,000. Our share of the gain was $26,322,000, and in addition we recognized income for our promoted interest of $26,742,000. In conjunction with the disposition of these communities, Fund II repaid the remaining $127,179,000 of secured indebtedness at par in advance of the scheduled maturity dates.\nThe Northern California region accounted for approximately 21.4% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 1.6% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 1.1% to $2,839 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.5% to 95.7% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect operating conditions to remain challenged in the Northern California region in 2018 due to slower job growth and an increase in competition from new apartment deliveries.\n \u2022 the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; \nDuring the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project-specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $47,063,000, $45,201,000 and $43,943,000 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.\n \u2022 our declaration or payment of dividends; \nWe cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired three communities containing an aggregate of 1,062 apartment homes and 27,000 square feet of retail space for an aggregate purchase price of $365,750,000.\n \u2022 For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. \nWe evaluate our real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. We assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments.\nCapitalized terms used without definition have the meanings provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n (2) Balances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity, and exclude deferred financing costs and debt discount for the unsecured notes of $47,236 and $36,698 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, deferred financing costs and debt discount associated with secured notes of $27,607 as of December 31, 2017, and deferred financing costs net of premium of $9,180 as of December 31, 2016, as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. \nIn 2018, we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, including (i) real estate dispositions, (ii) cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities, (iii) borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and (iv) secured and unsecured debt financings. Additional sources of liquidity in 2018 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects.\n \u2022 the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; \n \u2022 the anticipated operating performance of our communities; \n\nThe AC JV has four institutional investors, including us. Excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the AC JV, we have an equity investment of $49,492,000 (net of distributions), representing a 20.0% equity interest. The AC JV was formed in 2011.\nWe experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our Established Communities' regions in 2017 as compared to the prior year, as discussed in more detail below.\n (4) Maturity date reflects the contractual maturity of the underlying bond. There is also an associated earlier credit enhancement maturity date. \nThe increase in our Established Communities' NOI in 2017 and 2016 is due to increased rental rates, partially offset by increased operating expenses. The increase in 2016 is also partially offset by decreased economic occupancy.\n \u2022 In November 2017, we issued $450,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $445,271,000. The notes mature in January 2028 and were issued at a 3.20% coupon. \nNOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities.\n \u2022 our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; \nFor Established Communities, property taxes increased $5,300,000, or 3.5%, and $6,616,000, or 4.4%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased assessments in the current year periods, as well as successful appeals in the prior year periods in the Company's West Coast markets. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased assessments as well as appeals and supplemental tax reversals in 2015 in excess of those recognized in 2016. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change in the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). Massachusetts also has laws in place to limit property tax increases. We evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate.\n \u2022 In June 2017, we repaid $556,313,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.86% fixed rate secured notes secured by 12 wholly-owned operating communities, representing the remaining debt in the Freddie Mac cross-collateralized pool financing originated in 2009, in advance of their May 2019 maturity date. In conjunction with the repayment, we recognized a charge of $34,965,000, consisting of prepayment penalties of $33,515,000 and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $1,450,000. \nProperty taxes increased $16,538,000, or 8.1%, and $11,338,000, or 5.9%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities, increased assessments across our portfolio, as well as successful appeals and reductions of supplemental taxes in the prior years in excess of those recognized in the then current year.\nOur real estate investments consist primarily of Current Communities, Development Communities and Development Rights. Our Current Communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities, Redevelopment Communities and Unconsolidated Communities.\nof 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d estimate,\u201d assume,\u201d project,\u201d plan,\u201d may,\u201d shall,\u201d will\u201d and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to:\n \u2022 in conjunction with the refinancing of three secured borrowings in May 2017, in April 2017, we settled $185,100,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability of the secured notes, making a payment of $2,326,000; \n \u2022 the issuance of common stock in the amount of $111,093,000, primarily through CEP IV. \nWe determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate.\nRental and other income increased in both 2017 and 2016 compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our Established Communities. The changes between years are also impacted by business interruption insurance proceeds received due to the final settlement of the Edgewater and Maplewood casualty losses, as described above.\nInvestments and investment management expense increased by $1,114,000, or 23.1%, and $452,000, or 10.3%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to increases in compensation expense.\nThe following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands). We are not directly or indirectly (as borrower or guarantor) obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest.\n (2) NOI for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $3,495 in business interruption insurance proceeds related to the Maplewood casualty loss. \nNOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDuring 2017, we raised approximately $2,320,132,000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes, sale of common shares under CEP IV and the sale of real estate. This amount does not include proceeds from joint venture dispositions and secured debt associated with the refinancing of existing secured indebtedness. The funds raised from the sale of real estate consist of the proceeds from the sale of six operating communities, three undeveloped land parcels and other real estate. We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms.\nWe develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California. We focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life. We believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns over the long-term on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics. We believe that the Denver, Colorado, and Southeast Florida markets share these characteristics, and we are pursuing opportunities to invest in these markets through acquisitions and developments, having acquired one operating community in each of these markets in 2017. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive.\nWe have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities, as referenced in the table above, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so. In the future, in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support, or take any other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve.\n \u2022 investment of $979,947,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities; \nFinancial Covenants\n \u2022 payment of cash dividends in the amount of $772,657,000; and \n \u2022 our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; \n (5) Borrowing is comprised of loans made by the equity investors in the venture in proportion to their equity interests. \n \u2022 normal recurring operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses. \nNet income attributable to common stockholders decreased $157,081,000, or 15.2%, to $876,921,000 in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains, coupled with increases in depreciation, loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense, and a net casualty and impairment loss in the current year compared to a gain in the prior year. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities. Net income attributable to common stockholders increased $291,964,000, or 39.3%, to $1,034,002,000 in 2016 from 2015, primarily due to an increase in NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in real estate sales and related gains. These amounts were partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense, and a loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year coupled with a gain on extinguishment of debt in the prior year.\nFinancing Activities-Net cash used in financing activities totaled $418,947,000 in 2017. The net cash used was primarily due to:\n (3) In February 2018, we repaid this borrowing in advance of its scheduled maturity date, incurring a prepayment penalty of $152. \nThe adoption of ASU 2017-01, as discussed in Note 1, Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report, has impacted our accounting framework for the acquisition of investments in real estate. Prior to adoption of ASU 2017-01 on October 1, 2016, we accounted for acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement, which required the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value. Typical assets and liabilities acquired include land, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above or below market leases and in-place leases. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilized various sources, including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. Consideration for acquisitions is typically in the form of cash unless otherwise disclosed. We expensed all costs incurred related to acquisitions of operating communities. Subsequent to adoption of ASU 2017-01, we assess each acquisition of an operating community to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition. We expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions, and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs, and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities.\nThe Southern California region accounted for approximately 21.5% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2017 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 3.9% for 2017 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 4.1% to $2,214 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.3% for 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect an increase in new apartment deliveries in Southern California in 2018 but believe strengthening job and income growth will continue to support a favorable operating environment.\n \u2022 In May 2017, we issued $400,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $396,016,000. The notes mature in May 2027 and were issued at a 3.35% interest rate. \n_________________________________\n \u2022 In February 2017, we entered into a $250,000,000 variable rate unsecured term loan (the \"$250 million Term Loan\"), of which $100,000,000 matures in February 2022 with stated pricing of LIBOR plus 0.90%, and $150,000,000 matures in February 2024 with stated pricing of LIBOR plus 1.50%. In April 2017, we drew the $250,000,000 available under the $250 million Term Loan. \nEstablished Communities-Rental revenue increased $38,648,000, or 2.5%, to $1,574,395,000 for 2017 from $1,535,747,000 in the prior year. The increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 2.4% to $2,511 per apartment home and an increase in economic occupancy of 0.1% to 95.5%. Rental revenue increased $64,206,000, or 4.3%, for 2016, as compared to the prior year. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents.\nFactors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs.\nIf we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at December 31, 2017, our assets would have increased by $571,578,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $534,355,000. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur:\nWe believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2017, we completed the construction of 14 communities containing an aggregate of 5,189 apartment homes and 71,000 square feet of retail space, for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $1,897,000,000. We also started the construction of eight communities containing an aggregate of 2,600 apartment homes, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $808,000,000. In addition, during 2017 we completed the redevelopment of seven communities containing an aggregate of 2,072 apartment homes for a total investment of $99,000,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $164,000 and $1,178,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the timing of federal income tax expense amounts related to dispositions of our direct and indirect interests in certain real estate assets acquired in the Archstone Acquisition, which were owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary.\nInvesting Activities-Net cash used in investing activities totaled $965,381,000 in 2017. The net cash used was primarily due to:\nIn December 2015, we commenced a fourth continuous equity program ( CEP IV\u201d) under which we may sell up to $1,000,000,000 of our common stock from time to time. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. In conjunction with CEP IV, we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 2.0% of the gross sales price for shares sold. CEP IV also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements up to $1,000,000,000 in aggregate sales price of our common stock. We expect that we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. In connection with each forward sale agreement, we will pay the relevant forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, commission of up to 2.0% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. In 2017, we sold 568,424 shares at an average sales price of $188.39 per share, for net proceeds of $105,478,000. As of January 31, 2018, we had $892,915,000 of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program and no forward sales agreements outstanding.\n (8) During 2017, we repaid a borrowing secured by this community and subsequently refinanced the secured borrowing. \nThe following debt activity occurred during 2017:\nEstablished Communities are generally consolidated communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year, allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy during the current year. Lease-Up Communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. Unconsolidated Communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 8, Segment Reporting,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe expense costs related to abandoned pursuits, which include the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. These costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years.\n_________________________________\nThese amounts are partially offset by:\n \u2022 we may be unsuccessful in our management of the U.S. Fund, the AC JV or the REIT vehicles that are used with each respective joint venture; \n (2) We have not guaranteed the debt of unconsolidated investees and bear no responsibility for the repayment. \nDuring 2017, the U.S. Fund sold one community containing 192 apartment homes for a sales price of $107,000,000. Our share of the gain was $13,788,000. In conjunction with the disposition of this community, the U.S. Fund repaid $32,542,000 of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity date, which resulted in charges for prepayment penalties and write-offs of deferred financing costs, of which our portion was $406,000.\n \u2022 we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; \n \u2022 the availability of debt and equity financing; \n \u2022 the issuance of secured notes in the amount of $206,800,000; and \n \u2022 net distributions from unconsolidated real estate entities of $64,812,000. \nThere may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2017 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our costs charged to expense would have increased by $4,706,000.\nAs of December 31, 2017 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 288 apartment communities containing 84,158 apartment homes in 12 states and the District of Columbia, of which 21 communities were under development and nine communities were under redevelopment. Of these communities, 12 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including six owned by the U.S. Fund, three owned by the AC JV and one that is being developed within a joint venture. In addition, we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 29 wholly-owned communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated 9,496 apartment homes.\nIn 2017, we entered into $300,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2018, which are outstanding as of December 31, 2017. At maturity of the outstanding swap agreements, we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value.

points from the management's discussion and analysis report:\n\nOverview\n- Net income attributable to common stockholders was $876.9 million in 2017, a decrease of 15.2% from 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower gains on real estate sales, higher depreciation, losses on debt extinguishment, and higher interest expense.\n\n- Net operating income (NOI) from communities increased in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by increases in rental revenue from newly developed, acquired, and existing operating communities.\n\nOperations\n- Rental revenue increased 2.5% for established communities in 2017 compared to 2016, due to higher average rental rates and slightly higher economic occupancy. \n\n- Operating expenses for established communities also increased 2.5% in 2017, driven by higher compensation costs, bad debt, and maintenance expenses.\n\nInvestments\n- Development continues to be a focus, with the completion of 14 new communities in 2017 and 8 more under construction. This has driven increases in capital expenditures and depreciation expense.\n\nFinancing\n- Issued over $1.6 billion in new unsecured debt in 2017 to fund investments and repay debt. Continued focus on balance sheet strength and financial flexibility.\n\n- Debt repayments totaled over $1.3 billion in 2017, contributing to losses on debt extinguishment.  \n\nThe report provides an overview of financial and operating performance, details key investing activities, and summarizes important financing transactions during 2017. The main drivers of changes in net income are highlighted."}
