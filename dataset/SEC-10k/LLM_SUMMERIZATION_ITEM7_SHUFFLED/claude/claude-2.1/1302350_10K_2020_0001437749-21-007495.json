Subsequently, on March 11, 2020, WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. In March 2020, the U.S. equities market saw sharp declines and extreme volatility in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli by the U.S. government spurred a sharp recovery in U.S. equity prices directly. The U.S. equities market continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second half of 2020. The Company's equity capital markets and brokerage revenues directly benefited from the improved capital market condition.\nWe continue to closely monitor the status of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, the economy and capital markets globally. An economic recession could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. While we are optimistic that the equity market could remain active through year-end, we cannot reliably estimate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business in the 4th quarter and beyond.\nOn December 23, 2020, HCC and Portman Ridge Finance Corporation ( PTMN\u201d) announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which HCC will merge with and into PTMN, a business development company managed by Sierra Crest Investment Management LLC ( Sierra Crest\u201d), an affiliate of BC Partners Advisors L.P. The parties currently expect the transaction to be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2021. The Company's partially-owned subsidiary HCAP Advisors provides investment advisory services to HCC. In addition, the Company had investments in HCC common stock of $7.5 million as of December 31, 2020. In connection with the above transaction, HCC stockholders will receive aggregate consideration equal to HCC's net asset value at closing. This consideration will be funded using PTMN shares (valued at 100% of PTMN's net asset value per share at the time of closing of the transaction) and, to the extent the required number of PTMN shares exceeds 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of PTMN common stock immediately prior to the transaction closing, cash consideration in the amount of such excess. As described below, HCAP stockholders will have an opportunity, subject to certain limitations, to elect to receive either cash or PTMN shares in consideration for their HCAP shares. Additionally, all HCAP stockholders will receive an additional cash payment from Sierra Crest of $2.15 million in the aggregate, or approximately $0.36 per share.\nDeconsolidation of the CLOs and JMPCA\nOn January 17, 2019, the non-call period of JMP Credit Advisors CLO III(R) Ltd. ( CLO III\u201d) expired, which resulted in a change in the entity with the control over the most significant activities of the variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d). The expiration of the non-call period resulted in the Company losing control over the most significant activities of CLO III. The Company deconsolidated CLO III as of January 17, 2019. The Company continues to hold approximately 47% of the outstanding junior subordinated notes of CLO III and the Company accounts for its ownership of the CLO III subordinated notes as an investment in a CLO debt security. The Company recognized a gain of $1.6 million as revenue from principal transactions on the deconsolidation of CLO III for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn March 19, 2019, the Company sold a 50.1% equity interest in JMP Credit Advisors LLC (\"JMPCA\") to Medalist Partners LP ( Medalist\u201d), an alternative asset management firm specializing in structured credit and asset-backed lending, and a 4.9% interest to management employees of JMPCA. JMP Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, retained 45.0% of the equity interest in JMPCA. The sale of JMPCA was considered a reconsideration event as defined in Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) 810, Consolidation, which requires a new consolidation analysis, and the Company determined that JMPCA is a VIE after the transaction date. The Company determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of JMPCA as we are not the party with the power to direct the most significant activities of JMPCA. As the Company was determined to not be the primary beneficiary, the Company deconsolidated JMPCA as of the date of sale. As the Company still retains 45.0% of the equity interest of JMPCA and has significant influence, the Company has determined that it will account for its retained interest as an equity method investment after the date of deconsolidation, however; the Company has made the election to use the fair value option to account for the investment. The Company received a cash payment of $0.3 million in consideration for the limited liability company interest and recorded a gain of $3.4 million on deconsolidation as revenue from principal transactions. The transaction agreement also required Medalist to provide additional capital to purchase an equity interest in JMP Credit Advisors CLO VI Long-Term Warehouse Ltd (the \"CLO VI warehouse\") to finance the acquisition of broadly syndicated corporate loans, which resulted in Medalist related entities purchasing approximately 66% of the outstanding equity of the CLO VI warehouse. The Company will receive a portion of the subordinated management fees from the CLOs JMPCA managed as of the date of the sale. After the sale, JMPCA was renamed Medalist Partners Corporate Finance LLC ( MPCF\u201d).\n.\nAfter the sale of JMPCA, the Company concluded that it has lost the ability to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs: JMP Credit Advisors CLO IV Ltd. ( CLO IV\u201d), JMP Credit Advisors CLO V Ltd. ( CLO V\u201d), and the CLO VI warehouse (collectively with CLO III the CLOs\u201d) and also deconsolidated those CLOs as of March 19, 2019. The Company continues to hold 100% of the junior subordinated notes of CLO IV and CLO V and approximately 33% of the equity interests of the CLO VI warehouse. The Company owned 100% and 25% of the senior subordinated notes in CLO IV and CLO V, respectively, at the date of deconsolidation. The Company sold all of its senior subordinated notes in CLO IV and CLO V in May 2019. The Company accounts for its ownership of the subordinated notes as a beneficial interest in a debt security and accounts for its equity interests of the CLO VI warehouse as an equity investment. The Company classifies the junior subordinated notes as available-for-sale securities and classified the senior subordinated notes as trading securities up until their sale. Collectively, the Company recognized a loss on the deconsolidation of CLO IV, CLO V, and CLO VI warehouse of $1.8 million and a loss of $0.1 million on the sale of the senior subordinated notes of CLO IV and CLO V for the year ended December 31, 2019 in revenues from principal transactions.\nThe Election for JMP Group LLC to be Taxed as a C Corporation\nSince January 2015, JMP Group LLC had been a publicly traded partnership and, as such, was taxed as a partnership, and not as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income.\u201d On January 31, 2019, the Company filed an election with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes, rather than as a partnership, going forward. The election was approved and became retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019.\nAn entity taxed as a partnership generally does not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability, and any income, gains, losses or deductions are taken in by the owners of the partnership in computing their U.S. federal income tax liability, regardless of any distributions from the partnership. In contrast, an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally pays U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income as it is considered a taxable entity. For years beginning after December 31, 2017, the maximum U.S. federal tax rate imposed on the net income of corporations is 21%. This rate may be subject to change in the future. Owners of a corporate entity generally do not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability on any earnings of the corporation unless the corporation makes a distribution of cash or property. Any distributions paid from current or accumulated earnings are treated as dividends, and these \"qualifying dividends\" are generally taxed at a lower rate than the ordinary income tax rate. For corporate entities, as both the corporation and distributions from the corporation are taxed, there are two levels of potential tax on the income earned.\nComponents of Revenues\nWe derive revenues primarily from: fees from our investment banking business, net commissions from our sales and trading business, management fees and incentive fees from our asset management business, and interest income earned on collateralized loan obligations we manage. We also generate revenues from principal transactions, interest, dividends and other income.\nInvestment Banking\nWe earn investment banking revenues from underwriting securities offerings, arranging private capital markets transactions and providing advisory services in mergers and acquisitions and other strategic transactions.\nUnderwriting Revenues\nWe earn revenues from securities offerings in which we act as an underwriter, such as initial public offerings and follow-on equity offerings. Underwriting revenues include management fees, underwriting fees, selling concessions, and realized and unrealized net gains and losses on equity positions held in inventory for a period of time to facilitate the completion of certain underwritten offerings. We record underwriting revenues, gross of related syndicate expenses, on the trade date which is typically the date of pricing an offering (or the following day). The Company has determined that its performance obligations are completed and the related income is reasonably determinable on the trade date. In syndicated transactions, management estimates our share of transaction-related expenses incurred by the syndicate, and we recognize revenues gross of such expense. On final settlement by the lead manager, typically 90 days from the trade date of the transaction, we adjust these amounts to reflect the actual transaction-related expenses and our resulting underwriting fee. We receive a higher proportion of total fees in underwritten transactions in which we act as a lead manager.\nStrategic Advisory Revenues\nOur strategic advisory revenues primarily consist of success fees received upon the closing of mergers and acquisitions but also include retainer fees received when we are first engaged to provide advisory services. We also earn fees for related advisory work and other services, such as fairness opinions, valuation analyses, due diligence, and pre-transaction structuring advice. These revenues may be earned for providing services to either the buyer or the seller involved in a transaction. Depending on the nature of the engagement letter and the agreed upon services, customers may simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of services or services may culminate in the delivery of the advisory services at a point in time. The Company evaluates each contract individually and the performance obligations identified to determine if revenue should be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement or at a specific point in time. Any retainer fees received in connection with these agreements are individually evaluated and any unearned fees are deferred for revenue recognition.\nPrivate Capital Markets and Other Revenues\nWe earn fees for private capital markets and other services in connection with transactions that are not underwritten, such as private placements of equity securities, PIPE transactions and Rule 144A offerings. We record private placement revenues on the closing date of these transactions. Client reimbursements for costs associated for private placement fees are recorded gross within Investment banking and various expense captions, excluding compensation.\nSince our investment banking revenues are generally recognized at the time of completion of a transaction or the services to be performed, these revenues typically vary between periods and may be affected considerably by the timing of the closing of significant transactions.\nBrokerage Revenues\nOur brokerage revenues include trading commissions paid by customers for purchases or sales of exchange-listed and over-the-counter equity securities. Commissions resulting from equity securities transactions executed on behalf of customers are recorded on a trade date basis. The Company believes that the performance obligation is satisfied on the trade date because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer. Brokerage revenues also include net trading gains and losses that result from market-making activities and from our commitment of capital to facilitate customer transactions. Our brokerage revenues may vary between periods, in part depending on commission rates, trading volumes and our ability to deliver equity research and other value-added services to our clients. The ability to execute trades electronically, through the internet and through other alternative trading systems, has increased pressure on trading commissions and spreads across our industry. We expect this trend toward alternative trading systems and the related pricing pressure in the brokerage business to continue. We are, to some extent, compensated through brokerage commissions for the equity research and other value-added services we deliver to our clients. These soft dollar\u201d practices have been the subject of discussion among regulators, the investment banking community and our sales and trading clients. In particular, commission sharing arrangements have been adopted by some large institutional investors. In these arrangements, an institutional investor concentrates its trading with fewer execution\u201d brokers and pays a fixed amount for execution, with a designated amount set aside for payments to other firms for research or other brokerage services. Accordingly, trading volume directed to us by investors that enter into such arrangements may be reduced, or eliminated, but we may be compensated for our research and sales efforts through allocations of the designated amounts. Depending on the extent to which we agree to this practice and depending on our ability to enter into arrangements on terms acceptable to us, this trend would likely impair the revenues and profitability of our brokerage business by negatively affecting both volumes and trading commissions.\nAsset Management Fees\nWe earn asset management fees for managing a family of investment partnerships, including hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, a capital debt fund, as well as a publicly traded specialty finance company, Harvest Capital Credit Corporation (\"HCC\"). These fees include base management fees and incentive fees. Base management fees are generally determined by the fair value of the assets under management (\"AUM\") or the aggregate capital commitment and the fee schedule for each fund or account. Incentive fees are based upon the investment performance of the funds or accounts. For most of our funds, incentive fees equate to a percentage of the excess investment return above a specified high-water mark or hurdle rate over a defined period of time. For private equity funds, incentive fees equate to a percentage of the realized gain from the disposition of each portfolio investment in which each investor participates, which we earn after returning contributions by an investor for a portfolio investment. Some of these incentive fees are subject to contingent repayments to investors or clawback and cannot be recognized until it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. Any such fees earned are deferred for revenue recognition until the contingency is removed or the Company determines that it is not probable that a significant reversal of revenue will occur.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 the contractual base management fees earned from each of our investment funds or companies ranged between 1% and 2% of AUM or were between 1% and 2% of aggregate committed capital. The contractual incentive fees were generally 20%, subject to high-water marks, for the hedge funds; 5% to 20%, subject to high-water marks or a performance hurdle rate, for the hedge funds of funds; 20%, subject to high-water marks, for Harvest Growth Capital LLC ( HGC\u201d), Harvest Growth Capital II LLC ( HGC II\u201d) and Harvest Growth Capital III LLC ( HGC III\u201d); and 30% for JMP Capital I LLC (\"JMP Capital I\"). Our asset management revenues are subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors that are unpredictable, including the overall condition of the economy, the securities markets as a whole and our core sectors. These market and industry conditions can have a material effect on the inflows and outflows of AUM and on the performance of our asset management funds. For example, a significant portion of the performance-based or incentive fee revenues that we recognize are based on the value of securities held in the funds we manage. The value of these securities includes unrealized gains or losses that may change from one period to another.\nPrior to the sale of the majority equity interest in JMPCA, the asset management fees for the CLOs under management during the period consisted only of senior and subordinated base management fees. We recognized base management fees for the CLOs on a monthly basis over the period during which the collateral management services are performed. The base management fees for the CLOs were calculated as a percentage of the average aggregate collateral balances for a specified period. As we consolidated the CLOs, the management fees earned at JMPCA from the CLOs were eliminated on consolidation in accordance with GAAP. For the period from January 1, 2019 through January 17, 2019 (deconsolidation date), the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO III were 0.35% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the period from January 1, 2019 through March 19, 2019 (deconsolidation date) , the contractual base and subordinated fees earned from CLO IV were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the period from January 1, 2019 through March 19, 2019 (deconsolidation date), the contractual base and subordinated fees earned from CLO V were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the period from January 1, 2019 through March 19, 2019 (deconsolidation date), the contractual base and subordinated fees earned from CLO VI warehouse portfolio were 1.0% of the average equity contributions.\nThe redemption provisions of our funds require at least 90 days' advance notice. Redemptions are not permitted in our private equity funds or our private debt capital vehicles. The redemption provisions do not apply to the CLOs.\nPrincipal Transactions\nPrincipal transaction revenues include realized and unrealized net gains and losses resulting from our principal investments in equity, CLO and other debt securities. Principal transaction revenues also include unrealized net gains and losses resulting from our principal investments in various investment funds managed by the Company or by third parties.\nLoss on Sale, Payoff, and Mark-to-Market of Loans\nLoss on sale, payoff, and mark-to-market of loans consists of gains and losses from the sale and payoff of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities (\"ABS\", through March 2019). Gains are recorded when the proceeds exceed the carrying value of the loan.\nNet Dividend Income\nNet dividend income includes dividends from our investments offset by dividend expense resulting from short positions in our principal investment portfolio.\nOther Income\nOther income includes revenues from equity method investments, revenues from fee-sharing arrangements with our funds, contingent revenue from a sale of a general partnership, subordinated management fees earned on CLO investments, and fees earned to raise capital for third-party investment partnerships.\nInterest Income\nInterest income primarily consists of interest income earned on loans collateralizing ABS issued (through March 2019), investments in CLO debt securities, and loans held for investment. Interest income on loans is comprised of the stated coupon as a percentage of the face amount receivable as well as accretion of purchase discounts and deferred fees. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis, in accordance with the terms of the respective loans, unless such loans are placed on non-accrual status. Interest on CLO debt securities are recognized in interest income using the effective yield method.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense related to ABS issued and CLO warehouse credit facilities (through March 2019), Senior Notes, lines of credit, and notes payable, as well as the amortization of bond issuance costs. Interest expense on ABS is the stated coupon payable as a percentage of the principal amount payable adjusted for amortization of any discounts. Interest expense is recorded on an accrual basis, in accordance with the terms of the respective debt instruments.\nGain (Loss) on Repurchase, Reissuance, or Early Retirement of Debt\nLoss on repurchase, reissuance, or early retirement of debt primarily consists of losses incurred in the write-off of debt issuance costs related to Senior Notes that have been repurchased or retired sooner than the life of the instrument.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nProvision for loan losses includes the provision for losses recognized on loans held for investment in order to record those loans at their estimated net realizable value. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that is intended to estimate loan losses inherent in individual loans or in the homogenous loan portfolio. A provision for loan losses is charged to expense to establish the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level, in the opinion of management, sufficient to offset estimated losses inherent in individual loans or in the homogenous loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements. The appropriateness of the allowance and the allowance components are reviewed quarterly. Our estimate of each allowance component is based on observable information and on market and third-party data that we believe are reflective of the underlying loan losses being estimated. We employ internally developed and third-party estimation tools for measuring credit risk.\nA specific reserve is provided for loans that are considered impaired. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We measure impairment of a loan based upon either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, if the loan is collateral-dependent, depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy.\nLoans which are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off, and the charged-off amount is deducted from the allowance.\nComponents of Expenses\nWe classify our expenses as compensation and benefits; administration; brokerage, clearing and exchange fees; travel and business development; managed deal expenses, communications and technology; occupancy; professional fees, depreciation, and other. A significant portion of our expense base is variable, including compensation and benefits; brokerage, clearing and exchange fees; travel and business development; managed deal expenses, communication and technology expenses.\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits is the largest component of our expenses and includes employees' base pay, performance bonuses, sales commissions, related payroll taxes, and medical and benefits expenses, as well as expenses for contractors, temporary employees, and equity-based compensation. Our employees receive a substantial portion of their compensation in the form of an individual, performance-based bonus. As is the widespread practice in our industry, we pay bonuses, for the most part, on an annual basis, and for senior professionals these bonuses typically make up a large portion of their total compensation. A portion of the performance-based bonuses paid to certain senior professionals is paid in the form of deferred compensation. Bonus payments may have a greater impact on our cash position and liquidity in the periods in which they are paid than would otherwise be reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We accrue for the estimated amount of these bonus payments ratably over the applicable service period.\nCompensation is accrued with specific ratios of total compensation and benefits to total revenues applied to specific revenue categories, with adjustments made if, in management's opinion, such adjustments are necessary and appropriate to maintain competitive compensation levels.\nAdministration\nAdministration expense primarily includes the cost of hosted conferences, non-capitalized systems and software expenditures, insurance, business tax (non-income), office supplies, recruiting, and regulatory fees.\nBrokerage, Clearing, and Exchange Fees\nBrokerage, clearing, and exchange fees include the cost of floor and electronic brokerage and execution, securities clearance, and exchange fees. Changes in brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees fluctuate largely in line with the volume of our sales and trading activity.\nTravel and Business Development\nTravel and business development expense primarily consists of costs incurred traveling to client locations for the purposes of executing transactions or meeting potential new clients, travel for administrative functions, and other costs incurred in developing new business. Travel costs related to existing clients for mergers and acquisitions and underwriting deals are sometimes reimbursed by clients. Under the new revenue standard ASC 606, reimbursed costs are presented as revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nManaged Deal Expenses\nManaged deal expenses primarily relate to costs incurred and/or allocated in the execution of investment banking transactions, including reimbursable costs. Under the new revenue standard ASC 606, reimbursed costs are presented as revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCommunications and Technology\nCommunications and technology expense primarily relates to the cost of communication and connectivity, information processing and subscriptions to certain market data feeds and services.\nOccupancy Expenses\nOccupancy costs primarily include payments made under operating leases that are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease and the accretion of any lease incentives.\nProfessional Fees\nProfessional fees primarily relate to legal and accounting professional services.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation expenses include the straight-line amortization of purchases of certain furniture and fixtures, computer and office equipment, certain software costs, and leasehold improvements to allocate their depreciation amounts over their estimated useful life.\nOther Expenses\nOther operating expenses primarily include occupancy, depreciation, and administration expense.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of January 31, 2019, the Company filed an election with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes, rather than a partnership, going forward. The election was approved and became retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company does not have a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions using a two-step process: (i) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that each tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position; and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority\nThe Company's policy for recording interest and penalties associated with the tax audits or unrecognized tax benefits, if any, is to record such items as a component of income tax.\nNon-controlling Interest\nNon-controlling interest represents the pro rata share of the income or loss partially-owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td>

strategy and ongoing operations, as management believes that this metric appropriately illustrates the operating results of JMP Group LLC's core operations and business activities. Operating Net Income is derived from our segment reported results and is the measure of segment profitability on an after-tax basis used by management to evaluate our performance. This non-GAAP measure is presented to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance. Additionally, management believes that Operating Net Income is a useful measure because it allows for a better evaluation of the performance of JMP Group LLC's ongoing business and facilitates a meaningful comparison of the Company's results in a given period to those in prior and future periods.\nHowever, Operating Net Income should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with GAAP. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that, unless otherwise indicated, the adjustments concern gains, losses or expenses that JMP Group LLC generally expects to continue to recognize, and the adjustment of these items should not always be construed as an inference that these gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, management believes that both JMP Group LLC's GAAP measures of its financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together. Operating Net Income may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies.\nOperating Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the Company's GAAP net income as follows:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> reverses compensation expense recognized under GAAP related to equity awards;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> recognizes 100% of the cost of deferred compensation in the period for which such compensation was awarded, instead of recognizing such cost over the vesting period as required under GAAP, in order to match compensation expense with the actual period upon which the compensation was based;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> reverses amortization expense related to an intangible asset resulting from the repurchase of a portion of the equity of CLO III prior to March 2019;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (iv)\n</td> <td> unrealized gains or losses on commercial real estate investments, adjusted for non-cash expenditures, including depreciation and amortization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (v)\n</td> <td> reverses net unrealized gains and losses on strategic equity investments and certain warrant positions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (vi)\n</td> <td> reverses impairment of CLO debt securities recognized in principal transaction revenues, as the Company believes that the forecasted reduction in future cash flows will be mitigated by a change in the interest rate environment and that distributions will be larger than currently projected;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(vii) </td> <td>reverses the one-time transaction costs related to the refinancing or repurchase of the debt\u037e </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (viii)\n</td> <td>includes a combined federal, state and local income tax rate of 26% at the consolidated taxable parent company, JMP Group LLC\u037e </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(xi) </td> <td> presents revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates the CLOs (through March 19, 2019) and removes any non-controlling interest in consolidated but less than wholly owned subsidiaries; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(x) </td> <td>excludes a charge recorded in connection with severance costs deriving from a strategic restructuring and reduction in headcount in September 2020. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDiscussed below is our Operating Net Income (Loss) by segment.

We also saw a 72.3% increase in strategic advisory and private placements revenues, which increased from $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The number of transactions in which we acted as a bookrunning manager was 9 and 19 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nBrokerage Revenues\nBrokerage revenues earned in our Broker-Dealer segment were $18.9 million and $17.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Fees reported as other income were $3.7 million and $2.4 million for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, other income were 3.2% and 2.4% for both of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTotal segment asset management-related fees include base management fees and incentive fees from our assets under management, as well as other income from fee-sharing arrangements with, and fees earned to raise capital for, third-party or equity-method investment partnerships or funds. Total segment asset management-related fee revenues are reconciled to the GAAP measure, total asset management fee revenues, in the table above. We believe that presenting operating asset management-related fees is useful to investors as a means of assessing the performance of our combined asset management activities, including fundraising and other services for third parties. We also believe that asset management-related fee revenue is a more meaningful measure than standalone asset management fees as reported, because asset management-related fee revenues represent the combined impact of the various asset management activities on the Company's total net revenues.\nTotal segment asset management related fee revenue increased $2.2 million, from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In addition, we recognized a $3.4 million gain on deconsolidation of JMPCA in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTotal segment principal transaction revenues decreased from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $6.2 million for the same period in 2020. Total segment principal transaction revenues are a non-GAAP financial measure that aggregates our segment reported principal transaction revenues across each segment. The principal transaction revenues for both 2020 and 2019 were included in our Investment Income segment. Total segment principal transaction revenues are reconciled to the GAAP measure, total principal transaction revenues, in the table below.

Net interest income is earned in our Investment Income segment. Total segment net interest income after deconsolidation reflects the effective yield of the Company's ownership of subordinated notes in CLO III, CLO IV, and CLO V, net of bond interest expense. Total segment net interest income is reconciled to the GAAP measure, total net interest income, in the table above.

An effective tax rate of 26% is assumed for our taxable parent company, based on our best estimation of the subsidiary's average rate of taxation over the long term.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted in response to market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes many measures to help companies, including changes that are temporary and non-income based tax laws, some of which were part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The Company has made reasonable assessments in accounting for certain effects of the CARES Act that was passed. However, the provisional impacts may be refined over the prescribed measurement period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company carried back net operating losses that were created prior to 2020 which was subsequently used to offset years with taxable income that was derived from a different corporate tax rate.\nSummarized Financial Information\nJMP Group Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of JMP Group LLC, is the primary obligor of the Company's 7.25% Senior Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Senior Notes\u201d) (see Note 6, Loans). Pursuant to the indenture of the 2027 Senior Notes, JMP Group LLC and JMP Investment Holdings LLC (the Guarantors\u201d) are the guarantors of the 2027 Senior Notes. The Guarantors jointly and severally provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the due and punctual payment of the principal and interest on the 2027 Senior Notes and the due and punctual payment or performance of all other obligations of JMP Group Inc. under the indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes.\nThe following summarized financial information presents the information of JMP Group LLC, JMP Investment Holdings LLC and JMP Group Inc. on a combined basis and eliminates intercompany balances. It does not include or present investments in subsidiaries that are not an issuer or guarantor. One of the non-guarantor subsidiaries not combined, JMP Securities, is subject to certain regulations, which require the maintenance of minimum net capital. This requirement may limit the issuer's access to this subsidiary's assets.\nThese disclosures are in accordance with the new disclosure requirements under SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 and Rule 13-02 issued in March 2020. The amended financial disclosures will consist of summarized financial information, as defined in Rule 1-02(bb)(1) of Regulation S-X, of the issuers and guarantors, which may be presented on a combined basis, and reduce the number of periods presented. The amended non-financial disclosures, among other matters, will expand the qualitative disclosures about the guarantees and the issuers and guarantors. Consistent with the existing rule, disclosure of additional information about each guarantor will be required if it would be material for investors to evaluate the sufficiency of the guarantee. We have early adopted these disclosure rules. The tables below present summarized financial information as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe tables below present summarized financial information as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> As of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,557 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable securities owned, at fair value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,203 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due from non-obligated subsidiaries\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred tax asset\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,547 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease right-of-use asset\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,632 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bond payable, net of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,584 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due to non-obligated subsidiaries\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,912 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140,377 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(51,877 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,276 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities and equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net revenues after provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,882 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,237 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,047 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nIn the section that follows, we discuss the significant changes in the components of our balance sheet, cash flows, and capital resources and liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2020 to demonstrate where our capital is invested and the financial condition of the Company.\nOverview\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, certain costs declined in 2020 as the underlying activities are restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel and related expenses. In addition, after a careful review of our cost structure, we reduced headcount modestly during the quarter ended September 30, 2020. While the headcount reduction resulted in recognition of severance costs, the reduced ongoing cost should increase cash flows in the future periods. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our liquidity in future periods still remains uncertain.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $91.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $17.9 million in undrawn borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit (some of which borrowing capacity may be used for working capital - See the section entitled JMP Holding LLC Credit Agreement with CNB, below). Based on our historical results, management's experience and our current business strategy, we believe that our existing cash resources and available credit will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net liquid assets of $108.0 million consisting of cash and cash equivalents, receivable from clearing broker, marketable securities owned, investment banking fee receivable, net of marketable securities sold but not yet purchased and accrued compensation. We have satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of the Senior Notes, draws on a line of credit and internally generated cash from operations. Most of our financial instruments, other than certain marketable securities, are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value.\nLiquidity Considerations\nAs of December 31, 2020, our material indebtedness consisted of our then outstanding Senior Notes and borrowing on our revolving line of credit with City National Bank ( CNB\u201d) under the Credit Agreement described below.\nSenior Notes\nIn November 2017, JMP Group Inc. raised $50.0 million from the issuance of 7.25% Senior Notes ( 2027 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2027 Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2027 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at JMP Group Inc.'s option on or after November 28, 2020 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2027 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year, payable quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year. Pursuant to the indenture of the 2027 Senior Notes, JMP Group LLC and JMP Investment Holdings LLC (the Guarantors\u201d) are the guarantors of the 2027 Senior Notes. The Guarantors jointly and severally provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the due and punctual payment of the principal and interest on the 2027 Senior Notes and the due and punctual payment or performance of all other obligations of JMP Group Inc. under the indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes.\nIn September 2019, JMP Group LLC raised $36.0 million from the issuance of 6.875% Senior Notes ( 2029 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2029 Senior Notes will mature on September 30, 2029 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after September 30, 2021 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2029 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per year, payable quarterly on March 30, June 30, September 30, and December 30 of each year.\nIn March 2020, the Company repurchased $1.4 million and $0.7 million par value of its issued and outstanding 2029 Senior Notes and 2027 Senior Notes, respectively. Since they were repurchased at less than carrying value, a gain of $0.7 million was recognized upon the repurchase of the bonds, which has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, gain on repurchase, reissuance or early retirement of debt.\nOn January 4, 2021, the Company announced that JMP Group Inc. gave notice of its intention to redeem $10.0 million principal amount of the 2027 Notes which was completed on February 4, 2021.\nJMP Holding LLC Credit Agreement with CNB\nJMP Holding LLC (the Borrower\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2014 among the Borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d) and CNB, as administrative agent for the Lenders (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d).\nOn December 31, 2020, the Borrower entered into an Amendment Number Eight (the Eighth Amendment\u201d) to that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2014 among the Borrower, the Lenders and CNB. The Eighth Amendment extended the outside maturity date of the Revolving Loan under the Credit Facility from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2022 and removed the mechanism whereby the Revolving Loan would convert into a term loan for 12 months after the revolving period ends. The Eighth Amendment amended certain financial covenants and introduced a definition of Borrowing Base\u201d, which is a sum of certain assets of the Loan Parties, and added a provision that caps the total amount that can be borrowed under the Revolving Loan to the amount of the Borrowing Base if the Borrowing Base is lower than the Maximum Revolver Amount of $25 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Borrowing Base exceeded $25 million.\nThe Credit Agreement provides a $25.0 million revolving line of credit (the Revolver\u201d) through December 31, 2022 bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 225 bps.\nThe Credit Agreement provides that the Revolver may be used, on a revolving basis, to fund specified permitted investments in collateralized loan obligation vehicles. In addition, up to $5.0 million of the Revolver may be used, on a revolving basis, to fund other types of permitted investments and acquisitions and for working capital.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Borrower had drawn $6.0 million against the Revolver and had letters of credit outstanding under this facility to support office lease obligations of approximately $1.1 million in the aggregate.\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on debt, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of certain financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes an event of default for a change of control\u201d that tests, in part, the composition of our ownership and an event of default if three or more of the members of the Company's executive committee fail to be involved actively on an ongoing basis in the management of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. A violation of any one of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which would permit CNB to terminate our Revolver or Converted Term Loan and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding principal and interest. In addition, our subsidiaries are restricted under the Credit Agreement under certain circumstances from making distributions to us if an event of default has occurred under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the loan covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by all of the Company's other wholly owned subsidiaries (other than JMP Securities and certain dormant subsidiaries) and are secured by substantially all of its and the guarantors' assets. In addition, we have entered into a limited recourse pledge agreement with CNB whereby JMP Group LLC granted a lien on the equity interests in JMP Investment Holdings LLC and JMPAM to secure the Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement. In July 2020, the Company earned into a Seventh Amendment to its Credit Facility with CNB, that among other things, requires the Company maintain a minimum of $6.0 million of CLO debt securities, based on their fair value as of June 30, 2020 pledged as collateral supporting the obligations under the Credit Agreement. See Note 9, Loans, for more information on the Seventh Amendment.\nJMP Securities LLC Revolving Note Agreement with CNB\nUnder a Revolving Note and Cash Subordination Agreement (as amended, the Revolving Note Agreement\u201d) and related Revolving Note (as amended, the Revolving Note\u201d), each dated April 8, 2011, JMP Securities holds a $20.0 million revolving line of credit with CNB to be used for regulatory capital purposes in connection with its securities underwriting activities. Advances under the Revolving Note Agreement bear interest at CNB's announced prime interest rate. The unused portion of the line bears interest at the rate of 0.25% per annum, paid monthly.\nOn June 29, 2020, JMP Securities entered Amendment Number Eleven to the Revolving Note Agreement. Pursuant to this amendment, the $20.0 million Revolving Note Agreement was extended for one year until June 30, 2021. On June 20, 2021, any existing outstanding amount under the Revolving Note will convert to a term loan maturing the following year.\nThere was no borrowing on the Revolving Note as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nThe Revolving Note Agreement contains financial and other covenants. A violation of any one of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Note, which would permit CNB to terminate the Revolving Note and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding principal and interest, subject to the terms of the Revolving Note Agreement.\nAt both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, JMP Securities was in compliance with the loan covenants under the Revolving Note Agreement.\nJMP Securities' obligations under the Revolving Note Agreement are guaranteed by all of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries (other than JMP Securities and certain dormant subsidiaries) and are secured by substantially all the guarantors' assets.\nOther JMP Group LLC considerations\nOn May 13, 2019, the Company launched a self-tender offer (the Tender Offer\u201d) to repurchase for cash up to 3,000,000 of shares representing limited liability company interests of the Company. On June 13, 2019, the Company repurchased 1,816,732 shares under the Tender Offer at a price $3.95 per share for a total purchase price of $7.2 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the Tender Offer.\nOn February 24, 2020 the Company launched a second self-tender offer (the Second Tender Offer\u201d) to repurchase for cash up to 3,000,000 of shares at $3.25 a share, representing limited liability company interests of the Company, which was terminated on March 19, 2020 as a result of multiple conditions to the Self Tender Offer not having been satisfied.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not repurchase any of the Company's shares.\nOn February 19, 2020, the Company suspended its quarterly cash distributions program on outstanding shares.\nUpon the securitization of Medalist Partners Corporate Finance CLO VI in February 2020, the Company received $13.7 million in cash from the CLO VI warehouse and recognized a gain of $1.0 million.\nWe had total restricted cash of $1.2 million comprised primarily of restricted cash at JMP Group Inc. related to the Company's letters of credit on leasing arrangements.\nThe timing of bonus compensation payments to our employees may significantly affect our cash position and liquidity from period to period. While our employees and managing directors are generally paid semi-monthly during the year, bonus compensation, which makes up a larger portion of total compensation, is generally paid once a year during the first two months of the following year. In the first two months of 2020, we paid out $26.9 million of cash bonuses for 2019, including employer payroll tax expense.\nBecause of the nature of our investment banking and sales and trading businesses, liquidity is important to us. Accordingly, we regularly monitor our liquidity position, including our cash and net capital positions. We believe that our available liquidity and current level of equity capital, combined with the funds anticipated to be provided by our operating activities, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and regulatory capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. If circumstances required it, we could improve our liquidity position by discontinuing repurchases of the Company's common shares, halting cash distributions on our common shares and reducing cash bonus compensation paid.\nJMP Securities, our wholly-owned subsidiary and a registered securities broker-dealer, is subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to 1. JMP Securities had net capital of $42.3 million and $16.9 million, which were $40.6 million and $15.5 million in excess of the required net capital of $1.7 million and $1.4 million, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. JMP Securities' ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 0.62 to 1 and 1.25 to 1 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nA condensed table of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below.\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change from 2019 to 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,891 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60,448 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,552 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total cash flows </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(81,891 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>544.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2020\nCash increased by $41.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of cash used in operating, investing and financing activities.\nOur operating activities provided $27.1 million of cash from the net loss of $7.8 million, adjusted for the cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of $35.8 million, and used by non-cash revenue and expense items of $0.9 million. The cash provided by operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities of $23.6 million, an increase in accrued compensation of $16.1 million, partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease in receivables.\nOur investing activities provided $12.7 million of cash primarily due to $15.0 million from the sale of other investments, partially offset by the $2.0 million used to purchase other investments.\nOur financing activities provided $2.0 million of cash primarily due to $3.8 million in proceeds from a Paycheck Protection Program loan, partially offset by $1.4 million in repurchase of bonds payable.\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019\nCash increased by $81.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of cash used in operating, investing and financing activities.\nOur operating activities used $18.9 million of cash from the net loss of $6.6 million, adjusted for the cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $11.7 million, and used by non-cash revenue and expense items of $0.6 million. The cash used in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation of $11.1 million, an increase in other assets of $9.5 million, an increase of $4.1 million in interest payable, an increase in interest receivable of $5.0 million, partially offset by a $16.1 million decrease in marketable securities owned.\nOur investing activities used $60.5 million of cash primarily due to a $35.2 million funding of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued, a $25.7 million of funding for loans held for investment, $12.6 million used to purchase other investments and a $27.8 million decrease in cash and restricted cash due to deconsolidation of subsidiaries, partially offset by the $23.8 million of receipts from loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued and $10.4 million from the sale of other investments.\nOur financing activities used $2.5 million of cash primarily due to $35.9 million repayment on bonds payable, $10.6 million of repayment on line of credit, and $8.6 million repurchase of common shares for treasury, partially offset by cash provided by $36.0 in proceeds from bond issuance and $16.6 million in proceeds from line of credit.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, our aggregate minimum future commitment on our leases was $23.2 million. See Note 10 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $86.0 million of bonds payable were outstanding, of which $36.0 million carries interest at a rate of 6.875% per annum and is due in 2029 and the remaining $50.00 million carries interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum and is due in 2027. The bonds require quarterly payments of interest.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nUnfunded commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower, provided that all conditions have been met. The Company had no material unfunded commitments to lend at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe had no other material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020. However, through indemnification provisions in our clearing agreements with our clearing broker, customer activities may expose us to off-balance sheet credit risk, which we seek to mitigate through customer screening and collateral requirements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The use of different estimates and assumptions could produce materially different results. For example, if factors such as those described under the caption Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements in our Annual Report cause actual events to differ from the assumptions we used in applying the accounting policies, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We regard an accounting estimate or assumption to be most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations where:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of the estimates or assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUsing the foregoing criteria, we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies:\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures with respect to fair value measurements. The accounting principles related to fair value measurement apply to all financial instruments that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis. This includes those items currently reported in marketable securities owned, at fair value, other investments and marketable securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nMost of our financial instruments are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Marketable securities owned, other investments, including warrant positions and investments in partnerships in which HCS is the general partner, and marketable securities sold, but not yet purchased, are stated at fair value, with related changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in the line item Principal transactions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFair value of our financial instruments is generally obtained from quoted market prices, third-party pricing services, or alternative pricing methodologies that we believe offer reasonable levels of price transparency. Valuations obtained from pricing services are considered reflective of executable prices. Data obtained from multiple sources are compared for consistency and reasonableness. To the extent that certain financial instruments trade infrequently or are non-marketable securities and, therefore, do not have readily determinable fair values, we estimate the fair value of these instruments using various pricing models and the information available to us that we deem most relevant. Among the factors considered by us in determining the fair value of financial instruments are discounted anticipated cash flows, the cost, terms and liquidity of the instrument, the financial condition, operating results and credit ratings of the issuer or underlying company, the quoted market price of publicly traded securities with similar duration and yield, the Black-Scholes Options Valuation methodology and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of financial instruments.\nMarketable securities owned and securities sold, but not yet purchased, consist of U.S. listed and over-the-counter equity securities. Other investments include investments in private investment funds managed by us or our affiliates, as well as cash paid for a subscription in a private investment fund managed by a third party. Such investments held by non-broker-dealer entities are accounted for under the equity method based on our share of the earnings (or losses) of the investee. The financial position and operating results of the private investment funds are generally determined on an estimated fair value basis. Generally, securities are valued (i) at their last published sale price if they are listed on an established exchange or (ii) if last sales prices are not published, at the highest closing bid\u201d price (for securities held long\u201d) and the lowest closing asked\u201d price (for short\u201d positions) as recorded by the composite tape system or such principal exchange, as the case may be. Where the general partner determines that market prices or quotations do not fairly represent the value of a security in the investment fund's portfolio (for example, if a security is a restricted security of a class that is publicly traded) the general partner may assign a different value. The general partner will determine the estimated fair value of any assets that are not publicly traded.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its investments in private investment funds managed by third parties using the net asset value per share of those funds, as a practical expedient.\nThe Company uses the fair value option which allows an entity to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. The fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been chosen is reflected on the face of the balance sheet. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCLO Debt Securities\nInvestments in CLO debt securities are classified and accounted for according to their purpose and holding period. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of the Company's investments in CLO debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities may be sold before maturity and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d).\nInterest income on CLO debt securities is recognized in accordance with ASC 835, using the effective yield method. The effective yield on these securities is based on the projected cash flows from each security, which is estimated based on the Company's observation of the then current information and events, where applicable, and will include assumptions related to interest rates, prepayment rates and the timing and amount of credit losses. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company reviews and, if appropriate, makes adjustments to its cash flow projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and its judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in the yield/interest income recognized on such securities. Realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method and recognized in current period earnings in revenues from principal transactions.\nThe Company evaluates the available-for-sale CLO debt securities for impairment quarterly. As part of the evaluation, the Company obtains the new cash flow projections for the CLO debt securities at period end and determines, based on those cash flows and other current information, if there has been a favorable or adverse change in the cash flows expected to be collected as compared to the projected cash flows from the prior period. An adverse change in cash flows is determined in the context of both the timing and the amount of the cash flows. An impairment would be recorded if the net present value of the cash flows of the investment is below the amortized cost basis of the investment and the Company does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis before the security is expected to be sold or the security matures, whichever comes first. Should the Company determine that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is recognized in revenues from principal transactions. The Company recorded $21.7 million of impairment on CLO debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAsset Management Investment Partnerships\nInvestments in partnerships include our general partnership and limited partnership interests in investment partnerships, managed by our asset management subsidiaries. Such investments are accounted for under the equity method based on our proportionate share of the earnings (or losses) of the investment partnership or under the fair value option using the net asset value per share of those funds, as a practical expedient. Under the fair value option, these interests are carried at estimated fair value based on our capital accounts in the underlying partnerships. The assets of the investment partnerships consist primarily of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities, real estate and real estate-related enterprises and corporate loans. The underlying investments held by such partnerships are valued based on quoted market prices or estimated fair value if there is no public market for such assets. Such estimates of fair value of the partnerships' non-marketable investments are ultimately determined by our asset management subsidiaries in their capacity as general partner. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation, fair values of these non-marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments, and the differences could be material. Adjustments to carrying value are made, as required by GAAP, if there are third-party transactions evidencing a change in value. Downward adjustments are also made, in the absence of third-party transactions, if the general partner determines that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value.\nWe earn base management fees from the investment partnerships that we manage generally based on the net assets of the underlying partnerships. In addition, we are entitled to allocations of the appreciation and depreciation in the fair value of the underlying partnerships from our general partnership interests in the partnerships. Such allocations are based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements.\nWe are also entitled to receive incentive fee allocations from the investment partnerships when the return exceeds a specified high-water mark or hurdle rate over a defined performance period. Incentive fees are recorded after the quarterly or annual investment performance period is complete and may vary depending on the terms of the fee structure applicable to an investor.\nLegal and Other Contingent Liabilities\nWe are involved in various pending and potential claims, arbitrations, legal actions, investigations and proceedings related to our business from time to time. Some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts, including claims for punitive and other special damages. The number of claims, legal actions, investigations and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions like us has been increasing in recent years. We have, after consultation with counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management, recorded estimated losses in accordance with authoritative guidance under GAAP on contingencies, to the extent that a claim may result in a probable loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management and our ultimate liabilities may be materially different. In making these determinations, management considers many factors, including, but not limited to, the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant, the basis and validity of the claim, the likelihood of successful defense against the claim and the potential for, and magnitude of, damages or settlements from such pending and potential claims, legal actions, arbitrations, investigations and proceedings, and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies.\nIf a potential adverse contingency should become probable or resolved for an amount in excess of the established reserves during any period, our results of operations in that period and, in some cases, succeeding periods, could be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, and are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions using a two-step process: (i) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that each tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position; and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nThe Company's policy for recording interest and penalties associated with the tax audits or unrecognized tax benefits, if any, is to record such items as a component of income tax.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements affecting the Company, refer to Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Managed deal expenses primarily relate to costs incurred and/or allocated in the execution of investment banking transactions, including reimbursable costs. Under the new revenue standard ASC 606, reimbursed costs are presented as revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense related to ABS issued and CLO warehouse credit facilities (through March 2019), Senior Notes, lines of credit, and notes payable, as well as the amortization of bond issuance costs. Interest expense on ABS is the stated coupon payable as a percentage of the principal amount payable adjusted for amortization of any discounts. Interest expense is recorded on an accrual basis, in accordance with the terms of the respective debt instruments.\n\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year

underwriter, such as initial public offerings and follow-on equity offerings. Underwriting revenues include management fees, underwriting fees, selling concessions, and realized and unrealized net gains and losses on equity positions held in inventory for a period of time to facilitate the completion of certain underwritten offerings. We record underwriting revenues, gross of related syndicate expenses, on the trade date which is typically the date of pricing an offering (or the following day). The Company has determined that its performance obligations are completed and the related income is reasonably determinable on the trade date. In syndicated transactions, management estimates our share of transaction-related expenses incurred by the syndicate, and we recognize revenues gross of such expense. On final settlement by the lead manager, typically 90 days from the trade date of the transaction, we adjust these amounts to reflect the actual transaction-related expenses and our resulting underwriting fee. We receive a higher proportion of total fees in underwritten transactions in which we act as a lead manager.\nInvestment Banking\nComponents of Expenses\nThere was no borrowing on the Revolving Note

As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, investment banking revenues increased from 65.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 86.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Pursuant to this amendment, the $20.0 million Revolving Note Agreement was extended for one year until June 30, 2021. On June 20, 2021, any existing outstanding amount under the Revolving Note will convert to a term loan maturing the following year.\nTotal segment asset management-related fees include base management fees and incentive fees from our assets under management, as well as other income from fee-sharing arrangements with, and fees earned to raise capital for, third-party or equity-method investment partnerships or funds. Total segment asset management-related fee revenues are reconciled to the GAAP measure, total asset management fee revenues, in the table above. We believe that presenting operating asset management-related fees is useful to investors as a means of assessing the performance of our combined asset management activities, including fundraising and other services for third parties. We also believe that asset management-related fee revenue is a more meaningful measure than standalone asset management fees as reported, because asset management-related fee revenues represent the combined impact of the various asset management activities on the Company's total net revenues.\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,081 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income/(loss) attributable to JMP Group\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,697 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,549 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income/(loss) attributable to JMP Group per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.24 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.32 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Net Income/(Loss)*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(851 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Net Income/(Loss) per share*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.63 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.04 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe earn base management fees from the investment partnerships that we manage generally based on the net assets of the underlying partnerships.

Commissions resulting from equity securities transactions executed on behalf of customers are recorded on a trade date basis. The Company believes that the performance obligation is satisfied on the trade date because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer. Brokerage revenues also include net trading gains and losses that result from market-making activities and from our commitment of capital to facilitate customer transactions. Our brokerage revenues may vary between periods, in part depending on commission rates, trading volumes and our ability to deliver equity research and other value-added services to our clients. The ability to execute trades electronically, through the internet and through other alternative trading systems, has increased pressure on trading commissions and spreads across our industry. We expect this trend toward alternative trading systems and the related pricing pressure in the brokerage business to continue. We are, to some extent, compensated through brokerage commissions for the equity research and other value-added services we deliver to our clients. These soft dollar\u201d practices have been the subject of discussion among regulators, the investment banking community and our sales and trading clients. In particular, commission sharing arrangements have been adopted by some large institutional investors. In these arrangements, an institutional investor concentrates its trading with fewer execution\u201d brokers and pays a fixed amount for execution, with a designated amount set aside for payments to other firms for research or other brokerage services. Accordingly, trading volume directed to us by investors that enter into such arrangements may be reduced, or eliminated, but we may be compensated for our research and sales efforts through allocations of the designated amounts. Depending on the extent to which we agree to this practice and depending on our ability to enter into arrangements on terms acceptable to us, this trend would likely impair the revenues and profitability of our brokerage business by negatively affecting both volumes and trading commissions.\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset management related fees:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fees reported as asset management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,427 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fees reported as other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,373 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Non-controlling interest in HCAP Advisors\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,298 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,240 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment asset management related fee revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,560 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nJMP Securities, our wholly-owned subsidiary and a registered securities broker-dealer, is subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to 1. JMP Securities had net capital of $42.3 million and $16.9 million, which were $40.6 million and $15.5 million in excess of the required net capital of $1.7 million and $1.4 million, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. JMP Securities' ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 0.62 to 1 and 1.25 to 1 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nItem 7.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $86.0 million of bonds payable were outstanding, of which $36.0 million carries interest at a rate of 6.875% per annum and is due in 2029 and the remaining $50.00 million carries interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum and is due in 2027. The bonds require quarterly payments of interest.\nTotal segment principal transaction revenues decreased from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $6.2 million for the same period in 2020. Total segment principal transaction revenues are a non-GAAP financial measure that aggregates our segment reported principal transaction revenues across each segment. The principal transaction revenues for both 2020 and 2019 were included in our Investment Income segment. Total segment principal transaction revenues are reconciled to the GAAP measure, total principal transaction revenues, in the table below. See the Operating Net Income section above for additional information on the adjustments made to arrive at the non-GAAP measure and why management believes that this non-GAAP number is useful and important to the users of these financial statements.\n \u2022 management of collateralized loan obligations (through March 19, 2019) and a specialty finance company. \nMost of our financial instruments are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Marketable securities owned, other investments, including warrant positions and investments in partnerships in which HCS is the general partner, and marketable securities sold, but not yet purchased, are stated at fair value, with related changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in the line item Principal transactions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOther Expenses\nThe Company's policy for recording interest and penalties associated with the tax audits or unrecognized tax benefits, if any, is to record such items as a component of income tax.\nNet Interest Income/Expense\n (vii) reverses the one-time transaction costs related to the refinancing or repurchase of the debt\u037e (viii) includes a combined federal, state and local income tax rate of 26% at the consolidated taxable parent company, JMP Group LLC\u037e (xi) presents revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates the CLOs (through March 19, 2019) and removes any non-controlling interest in consolidated but less than wholly owned subsidiaries; and (x) excludes a charge recorded in connection with severance costs deriving from a strategic restructuring and reduction in headcount in September 2020. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPrincipal Transactions\nCommunications and technology expense primarily relates to the cost of communication and connectivity, information processing and subscriptions to certain market data feeds and services.\nThe Company, is a diversified capital markets firm headquartered in San Francisco, California. We have a diversified business model with a focus on small and middle-market companies and provide:\nJMP Securities' obligations under the Revolving Note Agreement are guaranteed by all of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries (other than JMP Securities and certain dormant subsidiaries) and are secured by substantially all the guarantors' assets.\nProvision for loan losses includes the provision for losses recognized on loans held for investment in order to record those loans at their estimated net realizable value. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that is intended to estimate loan losses inherent in individual loans or in the homogenous loan portfolio. A provision for loan losses is charged to expense to establish the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level, in the opinion of management, sufficient to offset estimated losses inherent in individual loans or in the homogenous loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements. The appropriateness of the allowance and the allowance components are reviewed quarterly. Our estimate of each allowance component is based on observable information and on market and third-party data that we believe are reflective of the underlying loan losses being estimated. We employ internally developed and third-party estimation tools for measuring credit risk.\nProfessional fees primarily relate to legal and accounting professional services.\nCash increased by $81.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of cash used in operating, investing and financing activities.\nIn March 2020, the Company repurchased $1.4 million and $0.7 million par value of its issued and outstanding 2029 Senior Notes and 2027 Senior Notes, respectively. Since they were repurchased at less than carrying value, a gain of $0.7 million was recognized upon the repurchase of the bonds, which has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, gain on repurchase, reissuance or early retirement of debt.\nAdministration expense was $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, administration expense decreased from 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 5.7% for the same period in 2020.\nUnderwriting Revenues\nOur operating activities used $18.9 million of cash from the net loss of $6.6 million, adjusted for the cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $11.7 million, and used by non-cash revenue and expense items of $0.6 million. The cash used in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation of $11.1 million, an increase in other assets of $9.5 million, an increase of $4.1 million in interest payable, an increase in interest receivable of $5.0 million, partially offset by a $16.1 million decrease in marketable securities owned.\nCommunications and technology expenses were $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, communications and technology expense increased to 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\nBrokerage Revenues\nGain (Loss) on Repurchase, Reissuance, or Early Retirement of Debt\nJMP Group Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of JMP Group LLC, is the primary obligor of the Company's 7.25% Senior Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Senior Notes\u201d) (see Note 6, Loans). Pursuant to the indenture of the 2027 Senior Notes, JMP Group LLC and JMP Investment Holdings LLC (the Guarantors\u201d) are the guarantors of the 2027 Senior Notes. The Guarantors jointly and severally provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the due and punctual payment of the principal and interest on the 2027 Senior Notes and the due and punctual payment or performance of all other obligations of JMP Group Inc. under the indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes.\nThe increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 41.9% increase in equity and debt origination revenues as JMP executed 101 deals in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 78 for the same period in 2019. We also saw a 72.3% increase in strategic advisory and private placements revenues, which increased from $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The number of transactions in which we acted as a bookrunning manager was 9 and 19 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n \u2022 investment banking services, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and other strategic advisory services, to corporate clients; \nCompensation and benefits as a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses increased from 77.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 82.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n.\nTravel and Business Development\nOn May 13, 2019, the Company launched a self-tender offer (the Tender Offer\u201d) to repurchase for cash up to 3,000,000 of shares representing limited liability company interests of the Company. On June 13, 2019, the Company repurchased 1,816,732 shares under the Tender Offer at a price $3.95 per share for a total purchase price of $7.2 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the Tender Offer.\nNon-controlling Interest\nProfessional Fees\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nPrincipal transaction revenues include realized and unrealized net gains and losses resulting from our principal investments in equity, CLO and other debt securities. Principal transaction revenues also include unrealized net gains and losses resulting from our principal investments in various investment funds managed by the Company or by third parties.\nLoss on Sale, Payoff, and Mark-to-Market of Loans\nNet Dividend Income\nInterest income on CLO debt securities is recognized in accordance with ASC 835, using the effective yield method. The effective yield on these securities is based on the projected cash flows from each security, which is estimated based on the Company's observation of the then current information and events, where applicable, and will include assumptions related to interest rates, prepayment rates and the timing and amount of credit losses. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company reviews and, if appropriate, makes adjustments to its cash flow projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and its judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in the yield/interest income recognized on such securities. Realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method and recognized in current period earnings in revenues from principal transactions.\nTravel and business development expense primarily consists of costs incurred traveling to client locations for the purposes of executing transactions or meeting potential new clients, travel for administrative functions, and other costs incurred in developing new business. Travel costs related to existing clients for mergers and acquisitions and underwriting deals are sometimes reimbursed by clients. Under the new revenue standard ASC 606, reimbursed costs are presented as revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Election for JMP Group LLC to be Taxed as a C Corporation\nIncome Taxes\nHowever, Operating Net Income should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with GAAP. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that, unless otherwise indicated, the adjustments concern gains, losses or expenses that JMP Group LLC generally expects to continue to recognize, and the adjustment of these items should not always be construed as an inference that these gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, management believes that both JMP Group LLC's GAAP measures of its financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together. Operating Net Income may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies.\nOccupancy expenses were $4.8 and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, occupancy expenses were 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and were 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nManaged Deal Expenses\nBecause of the nature of our investment banking and sales and trading businesses, liquidity is important to us. Accordingly, we regularly monitor our liquidity position, including our cash and net capital positions. We believe that our available liquidity and current level of equity capital, combined with the funds anticipated to be provided by our operating activities, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and regulatory capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. If circumstances required it, we could improve our liquidity position by discontinuing repurchases of the Company's common shares, halting cash distributions on our common shares and reducing cash bonus compensation paid.\nThe Credit Agreement provides a $25.0 million revolving line of credit (the Revolver\u201d) through December 31, 2022 bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 225 bps.\nEquity-based compensation was $1.7 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nJMP Holding LLC Credit Agreement with CNB\nUsing the foregoing criteria, we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies:\nWe classify our expenses as compensation and benefits; administration; brokerage, clearing and exchange fees; travel and business development; managed deal expenses, communications and technology; occupancy; professional fees, depreciation, and other. A significant portion of our expense base is variable, including compensation and benefits; brokerage, clearing and exchange fees; travel and business development; managed deal expenses, communication and technology expenses.\n (vi) reverses impairment of CLO debt securities recognized in principal transaction revenues, as the Company believes that the forecasted reduction in future cash flows will be mitigated by a change in the interest rate environment and that distributions will be larger than currently projected; \nThe Company uses the fair value option which allows an entity to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. The fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been chosen is reflected on the face of the balance sheet. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDiscussed below is our Operating Net Income (Loss) by segment. This information is reflected in a manner utilized by management to assess the financial operations of the Company's various business lines.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not repurchase any of the Company's shares.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $91.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $17.9 million in undrawn borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit (some of which borrowing capacity may be used for working capital - See the section entitled JMP Holding LLC Credit Agreement with CNB, below). Based on our historical results, management's experience and our current business strategy, we believe that our existing cash resources and available credit will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nInterest Income\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nJMP Securities LLC Revolving Note Agreement with CNB\nSummarized Financial Information\nResults of Operations\n\nTotal segment net interest income decreased $8.4 million from $5.3 million the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by the deconsolidation of the CLOs in the first quarter of 2019. Net interest income is earned in our Investment Income segment. Total segment net interest income after deconsolidation reflects the effective yield of the Company's ownership of subordinated notes in CLO III, CLO IV, and CLO V, net of bond interest expense. Total segment net interest income is reconciled to the GAAP measure, total net interest income, in the table above. As a percentage of total adjusted net revenues, net interest income was 1.3% and 5.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nStrategic Advisory Revenues\nIf a potential adverse contingency should become probable or resolved for an amount in excess of the established reserves during any period, our results of operations in that period and, in some cases, succeeding periods, could be adversely affected.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table represents a summary of the Company's client assets under management with respect to the assets managed by HCS, JMP Asset Management LLC ( JMPAM\u201d), HCAP Advisors LLC ( HCAP Advisors\u201d) and assets managed by sponsored funds:\nWe continue to closely monitor the status of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, the economy and capital markets globally. An economic recession could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. While we are optimistic that the equity market could remain active through year-end, we cannot reliably estimate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business in the 4th quarter and beyond.\nDepreciation\nManaged deal expenses\nOn January 30, 2020, the spread of novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d). Subsequently, on March 11, 2020, WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. In March 2020, the U.S. equities market saw sharp declines and extreme volatility in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur strategic advisory revenues primarily consist of success fees received upon the closing of mergers and acquisitions but also include retainer fees received when we are first engaged to provide advisory services. We also earn fees for related advisory work and other services, such as fairness opinions, valuation analyses, due diligence, and pre-transaction structuring advice. These revenues may be earned for providing services to either the buyer or the seller involved in a transaction. Depending on the nature of the engagement letter and the agreed upon services, customers may simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of services or services may culminate in the delivery of the advisory services at a point in time. The Company evaluates each contract individually and the performance obligations identified to determine if revenue should be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement or at a specific point in time. Any retainer fees received in connection with these agreements are individually evaluated and any unearned fees are deferred for revenue recognition.\nOn February 24, 2020 the Company launched a second self-tender offer (the Second Tender Offer\u201d) to repurchase for cash up to 3,000,000 of shares at $3.25 a share, representing limited liability company interests of the Company, which was terminated on March 19, 2020 as a result of multiple conditions to the Self Tender Offer not having been satisfied.\n (iv) unrealized gains or losses on commercial real estate investments, adjusted for non-cash expenditures, including depreciation and amortization; \n (1) For HCS, JMPAM, and HCAP Advisors, client assets under management represent the net assets of such funds or the commitment amount. (2) Sponsored funds are third-party asset managers in which the Company owns an economic interest. \nSegment income tax was an expense of $4.4 million and a benefit of $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. An effective tax rate of 26% is assumed for our taxable parent company, based on our best estimation of the subsidiary's average rate of taxation over the long term.\nOccupancy Expenses\nThe Credit Agreement provides that the Revolver may be used, on a revolving basis, to fund specified permitted investments in collateralized loan obligation vehicles. In addition, up to $5.0 million of the Revolver may be used, on a revolving basis, to fund other types of permitted investments and acquisitions and for working capital.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our aggregate minimum future commitment on our leases was $23.2 million. See Note 10 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nWe earn fees for private capital markets and other services in connection with transactions that are not underwritten, such as private placements of equity securities, PIPE transactions and Rule 144A offerings. We record private placement revenues on the closing date of these transactions. Client reimbursements for costs associated for private placement fees are recorded gross within Investment banking and various expense captions, excluding compensation.\nIncome tax benefit was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, while an income tax benefit of $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nPrivate Capital Markets and Other Revenues\nWe are also entitled to receive incentive fee allocations from the investment partnerships when the return exceeds a specified high-water mark or hurdle rate over a defined performance period. Incentive fees are recorded after the quarterly or annual investment performance period is complete and may vary depending on the terms of the fee structure applicable to an investor.\nWe earn investment banking revenues from underwriting securities offerings, arranging private capital markets transactions and providing advisory services in mergers and acquisitions and other strategic transactions.\nOperating Net Income (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nOn December 31, 2020, the Borrower entered into an Amendment Number Eight (the Eighth Amendment\u201d) to that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2014 among the Borrower, the Lenders and CNB. The Eighth Amendment extended the outside maturity date of the Revolving Loan under the Credit Facility from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2022 and removed the mechanism whereby the Revolving Loan would convert into a term loan for 12 months after the revolving period ends. The Eighth Amendment amended certain financial covenants and introduced a definition of Borrowing Base\u201d, which is a sum of certain assets of the Loan Parties, and added a provision that caps the total amount that can be borrowed under the Revolving Loan to the amount of the Borrowing Base if the Borrowing Base is lower than the Maximum Revolver Amount of $25 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Borrowing Base exceeded $25 million.\nWe had no other material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020. However, through indemnification provisions in our clearing agreements with our clearing broker, customer activities may expose us to off-balance sheet credit risk, which we seek to mitigate through customer screening and collateral requirements.\n</table>\nTravel and business development expenses decreased $4.0 million, from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by lower volume of business travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, travel and business development expense was 1.1% and 5.2% and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCommunications and Technology\nOur operating activities provided $27.1 million of cash from the net loss of $7.8 million, adjusted for the cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of $35.8 million, and used by non-cash revenue and expense items of $0.9 million. The cash provided by operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities of $23.6 million, an increase in accrued compensation of $16.1 million, partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease in receivables.\nOverview\nDepreciation expenses were $1.5 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, depreciation was 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted in response to market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes many measures to help companies, including changes that are temporary and non-income based tax laws, some of which were part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The Company has made reasonable assessments in accounting for certain effects of the CARES Act that was passed. However, the provisional impacts may be refined over the prescribed measurement period.\n \u2022 the impact of the estimates or assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material. \nInvestments in CLO debt securities are classified and accounted for according to their purpose and holding period. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of the Company's investments in CLO debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities may be sold before maturity and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d).\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet dividend income includes dividends from our investments offset by dividend expense resulting from short positions in our principal investment portfolio.\nBrokerage revenues earned in our Broker-Dealer segment were $18.9 million and $17.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Brokerage revenues decreased as a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, from 17.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 16.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an operating basis, brokerage revenues were 13.6% and 16.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as a percentage of adjusted net revenues.\nThese disclosures are in accordance with the new disclosure requirements under SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 and Rule 13-02 issued in March 2020. The amended financial disclosures will consist of summarized financial information, as defined in Rule 1-02(bb)(1) of Regulation S-X, of the issuers and guarantors, which may be presented on a combined basis, and reduce the number of periods presented. The amended non-financial disclosures, among other matters, will expand the qualitative disclosures about the guarantees and the issuers and guarantors. Consistent with the existing rule, disclosure of additional information about each guarantor will be required if it would be material for investors to evaluate the sufficiency of the guarantee. We have early adopted these disclosure rules. The tables below present summarized financial information as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOverview\nDepreciation expenses include the straight-line amortization of purchases of certain furniture and fixtures, computer and office equipment, certain software costs, and leasehold improvements to allocate their depreciation amounts over their estimated useful life.\nCash increased by $41.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of cash used in operating, investing and financing activities.\nAs of January 31, 2019, the Company filed an election with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes, rather than a partnership, going forward. The election was approved and became retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019.\nLiquidity Considerations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 the contractual base management fees earned from each of our investment funds or companies ranged between 1% and 2% of AUM or were between 1% and 2% of aggregate committed capital. The contractual incentive fees were generally 20%, subject to high-water marks, for the hedge funds; 5% to 20%, subject to high-water marks or a performance hurdle rate, for the hedge funds of funds; 20%, subject to high-water marks, for Harvest Growth Capital LLC ( HGC\u201d), Harvest Growth Capital II LLC ( HGC II\u201d) and Harvest Growth Capital III LLC ( HGC III\u201d); and 30% for JMP Capital I LLC (\"JMP Capital I\"). Our asset management revenues are subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors that are unpredictable, including the overall condition of the economy, the securities markets as a whole and our core sectors. These market and industry conditions can have a material effect on the inflows and outflows of AUM and on the performance of our asset management funds. For example, a significant portion of the performance-based or incentive fee revenues that we recognize are based on the value of securities held in the funds we manage. The value of these securities includes unrealized gains or losses that may change from one period to another.\nProfessional fees were $3.7 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, professional fees were 3.2% and 4.4% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEmployee payroll, taxes and benefits, and consultant fees were $40.8 million and $42.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Performance-based bonus and commission increased $19.3 million from $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe are involved in various pending and potential claims, arbitrations, legal actions, investigations and proceedings related to our business from time to time. Some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts, including claims for punitive and other special damages. The number of claims, legal actions, investigations and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions like us has been increasing in recent years. We have, after consultation with counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management, recorded estimated losses in accordance with authoritative guidance under GAAP on contingencies, to the extent that a claim may result in a probable loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management and our ultimate liabilities may be materially different. In making these determinations, management considers many factors, including, but not limited to, the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant, the basis and validity of the claim, the likelihood of successful defense against the claim and the potential for, and magnitude of, damages or settlements from such pending and potential claims, legal actions, arbitrations, investigations and proceedings, and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies.\n\n \u2022 sales and trading and related securities brokerage services to institutional investors; \nCompensation and benefits is the largest component of our expenses and includes employees' base pay, performance bonuses, sales commissions, related payroll taxes, and medical and benefits expenses, as well as expenses for contractors, temporary employees, and equity-based compensation. Our employees receive a substantial portion of their compensation in the form of an individual, performance-based bonus. As is the widespread practice in our industry, we pay bonuses, for the most part, on an annual basis, and for senior professionals these bonuses typically make up a large portion of their total compensation. A portion of the performance-based bonuses paid to certain senior professionals is paid in the form of deferred compensation. Bonus payments may have a greater impact on our cash position and liquidity in the periods in which they are paid than would otherwise be reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We accrue for the estimated amount of these bonus payments ratably over the applicable service period.\nOn January 4, 2021, the Company announced that JMP Group Inc. gave notice of its intention to redeem $10.0 million principal amount of the 2027 Notes which was completed on February 4, 2021.\nOur investing activities provided $12.7 million of cash primarily due to $15.0 million from the sale of other investments, partially offset by the $2.0 million used to purchase other investments.\n\nOccupancy costs primarily include payments made under operating leases that are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease and the accretion of any lease incentives.\nAsset Management Fees\nThe tables below present summarized financial information as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAt both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, JMP Securities was in compliance with the loan covenants under the Revolving Note Agreement.\nOur financing activities used $2.5 million of cash primarily due to $35.9 million repayment on bonds payable, $10.6 million of repayment on line of credit, and $8.6 million repurchase of common shares for treasury, partially offset by cash provided by $36.0 in proceeds from bond issuance and $16.6 million in proceeds from line of credit.\nManaged deal expenses were $3.6 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total equity and debt origination revenues, managed deal expenses remained consistent at 6.0% percent and 7.4% for the years ended December 31 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nLegal and Other Contingent Liabilities\nProfessional Fees\nAn entity taxed as a partnership generally does not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability, and any income, gains, losses or deductions are taken in by the owners of the partnership in computing their U.S. federal income tax liability, regardless of any distributions from the partnership. In contrast, an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally pays U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income as it is considered a taxable entity. For years beginning after December 31, 2017, the maximum U.S. federal tax rate imposed on the net income of corporations is 21%. This rate may be subject to change in the future. Owners of a corporate entity generally do not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability on any earnings of the corporation unless the corporation makes a distribution of cash or property. Any distributions paid from current or accumulated earnings are treated as dividends, and these \"qualifying dividends\" are generally taxed at a lower rate than the ordinary income tax rate. For corporate entities, as both the corporation and distributions from the corporation are taxed, there are two levels of potential tax on the income earned.\nAdministration\nNon-Interest Expenses\nWe derive revenues primarily from: fees from our investment banking business, net commissions from our sales and trading business, management fees and incentive fees from our asset management business, and interest income earned on collateralized loan obligations we manage. We also generate revenues from principal transactions, interest, dividends and other income.\nFair value of our financial instruments is generally obtained from quoted market prices, third-party pricing services, or alternative pricing methodologies that we believe offer reasonable levels of price transparency. Valuations obtained from pricing services are considered reflective of executable prices. Data obtained from multiple sources are compared for consistency and reasonableness. To the extent that certain financial instruments trade infrequently or are non-marketable securities and, therefore, do not have readily determinable fair values, we estimate the fair value of these instruments using various pricing models and the information available to us that we deem most relevant. Among the factors considered by us in determining the fair value of financial instruments are discounted anticipated cash flows, the cost, terms and liquidity of the instrument, the financial condition, operating results and credit ratings of the issuer or underlying company, the quoted market price of publicly traded securities with similar duration and yield, the Black-Scholes Options Valuation methodology and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of financial instruments.\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2020\nMarketable securities owned and securities sold, but not yet purchased, consist of U.S. listed and over-the-counter equity securities. Other investments include investments in private investment funds managed by us or our affiliates, as well as cash paid for a subscription in a private investment fund managed by a third party. Such investments held by non-broker-dealer entities are accounted for under the equity method based on our share of the earnings (or losses) of the investee. The financial position and operating results of the private investment funds are generally determined on an estimated fair value basis. Generally, securities are valued (i) at their last published sale price if they are listed on an established exchange or (ii) if last sales prices are not published, at the highest closing bid\u201d price (for securities held long\u201d) and the lowest closing asked\u201d price (for short\u201d positions) as recorded by the composite tape system or such principal exchange, as the case may be. Where the general partner determines that market prices or quotations do not fairly represent the value of a security in the investment fund's portfolio (for example, if a security is a restricted security of a class that is publicly traded) the general partner may assign a different value. The general partner will determine the estimated fair value of any assets that are not publicly traded.\nCompensation and Benefits\nLoans which are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off, and the charged-off amount is deducted from the allowance.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its investments in private investment funds managed by third parties using the net asset value per share of those funds, as a practical expedient.\nThe Revolving Note Agreement contains financial and other covenants. A violation of any one of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Note, which would permit CNB to terminate the Revolving Note and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding principal and interest, subject to the terms of the Revolving Note Agreement.\n (iii) reverses amortization expense related to an intangible asset resulting from the repurchase of a portion of the equity of CLO III prior to March 2019; \nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The use of different estimates and assumptions could produce materially different results. For example, if factors such as those described under the caption Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements in our Annual Report cause actual events to differ from the assumptions we used in applying the accounting policies, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nAdministration expense primarily includes the cost of hosted conferences, non-capitalized systems and software expenditures, insurance, business tax (non-income), office supplies, recruiting, and regulatory fees.\nAsset Management Investment Partnerships\nTotal segment asset management related fee revenue increased $2.2 million, from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an operating basis, asset management related fee revenues were 7.7% and 8.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as a percentage of adjusted net revenues.\nSince our investment banking revenues are generally recognized at the time of completion of a transaction or the services to be performed, these revenues typically vary between periods and may be affected considerably by the timing of the closing of significant transactions.\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on debt, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of certain financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes an event of default for a change of control\u201d that tests, in part, the composition of our ownership and an event of default if three or more of the members of the Company's executive committee fail to be involved actively on an ongoing basis in the management of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. A violation of any one of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which would permit CNB to terminate our Revolver or Converted Term Loan and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding principal and interest. In addition, our subsidiaries are restricted under the Credit Agreement under certain circumstances from making distributions to us if an event of default has occurred under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company does not have a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020.\nIn November 2017, JMP Group Inc. raised $50.0 million from the issuance of 7.25% Senior Notes ( 2027 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2027 Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2027 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at JMP Group Inc.'s option on or after November 28, 2020 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2027 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year, payable quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year. Pursuant to the indenture of the 2027 Senior Notes, JMP Group LLC and JMP Investment Holdings LLC (the Guarantors\u201d) are the guarantors of the 2027 Senior Notes. The Guarantors jointly and severally provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the due and punctual payment of the principal and interest on the 2027 Senior Notes and the due and punctual payment or performance of all other obligations of JMP Group Inc. under the indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes.\nNet interest income decreased $3.7 million from $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of the CLOs in the first quarter of 2019. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, net interest income was 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPrincipal transaction revenues decreased $19.9 million, from a gain of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a loss of $18.5 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a $21.7 million impairment loss on CLO debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $4.2 million. In addition, we recognized a $3.4 million gain on deconsolidation of JMPCA in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.\nDeconsolidation of the CLOs and JMPCA\nJMP Holding LLC (the Borrower\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2014 among the Borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d) and CNB, as administrative agent for the Lenders (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d).\nThe Company evaluates the available-for-sale CLO debt securities for impairment quarterly. As part of the evaluation, the Company obtains the new cash flow projections for the CLO debt securities at period end and determines, based on those cash flows and other current information, if there has been a favorable or adverse change in the cash flows expected to be collected as compared to the projected cash flows from the prior period. An adverse change in cash flows is determined in the context of both the timing and the amount of the cash flows. An impairment would be recorded if the net present value of the cash flows of the investment is below the amortized cost basis of the investment and the Company does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis before the security is expected to be sold or the security matures, whichever comes first. Should the Company determine that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is recognized in revenues from principal transactions. The Company recorded $21.7 million of impairment on CLO debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019\nOur financing activities provided $2.0 million of cash primarily due to $3.8 million in proceeds from a Paycheck Protection Program loan, partially offset by $1.4 million in repurchase of bonds payable.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nInterest Expense\n (i) reverses compensation expense recognized under GAAP related to equity awards; \nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements affecting the Company, refer to Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nInvestments in partnerships include our general partnership and limited partnership interests in investment partnerships, managed by our asset management subsidiaries. Such investments are accounted for under the equity method based on our proportionate share of the earnings (or losses) of the investment partnership or under the fair value option using the net asset value per share of those funds, as a practical expedient. Under the fair value option, these interests are carried at estimated fair value based on our capital accounts in the underlying partnerships. The assets of the investment partnerships consist primarily of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities, real estate and real estate-related enterprises and corporate loans. The underlying investments held by such partnerships are valued based on quoted market prices or estimated fair value if there is no public market for such assets. Such estimates of fair value of the partnerships' non-marketable investments are ultimately determined by our asset management subsidiaries in their capacity as general partner. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation, fair values of these non-marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments, and the differences could be material. Adjustments to carrying value are made, as required by GAAP, if there are third-party transactions evidencing a change in value. Downward adjustments are also made, in the absence of third-party transactions, if the general partner determines that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value.\nA condensed table of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below.\nOur investing activities used $60.5 million of cash primarily due to a $35.2 million funding of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued, a $25.7 million of funding for loans held for investment, $12.6 million used to purchase other investments and a $27.8 million decrease in cash and restricted cash due to deconsolidation of subsidiaries, partially offset by the $23.8 million of receipts from loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued and $10.4 million from the sale of other investments.\nSince January 2015, JMP Group LLC had been a publicly traded partnership and, as such, was taxed as a partnership, and not as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income.\u201d On January 31, 2019, the Company filed an election with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes, rather than as a partnership, going forward. The election was approved and became retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019.\nIn September 2019, JMP Group LLC raised $36.0 million from the issuance of 6.875% Senior Notes ( 2029 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2029 Senior Notes will mature on September 30, 2029 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after September 30, 2021 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2029 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per year, payable quarterly on March 30, June 30, September 30, and December 30 of each year.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions using a two-step process: (i) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that each tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position; and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority\nBrokerage, clearing and exchange fees was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $2.6 million for the same period in 2020. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, our brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased from 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 2.3% for the same period in 2020.\nAfter the sale of JMPCA, the Company concluded that it has lost the ability to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs: JMP Credit Advisors CLO IV Ltd. ( CLO IV\u201d), JMP Credit Advisors CLO V Ltd. ( CLO V\u201d), and the CLO VI warehouse (collectively with CLO III the CLOs\u201d) and also deconsolidated those CLOs as of March 19, 2019. The Company continues to hold 100% of the junior subordinated notes of CLO IV and CLO V and approximately 33% of the equity interests of the CLO VI warehouse. The Company owned 100% and 25% of the senior subordinated notes in CLO IV and CLO V, respectively, at the date of deconsolidation. The Company sold all of its senior subordinated notes in CLO IV and CLO V in May 2019. The Company accounts for its ownership of the subordinated notes as a beneficial interest in a debt security and accounts for its equity interests of the CLO VI warehouse as an equity investment. The Company classifies the junior subordinated notes as available-for-sale securities and classified the senior subordinated notes as trading securities up until their sale. Collectively, the Company recognized a loss on the deconsolidation of CLO IV, CLO V, and CLO VI warehouse of $1.8 million and a loss of $0.1 million on the sale of the senior subordinated notes of CLO IV and CLO V for the year ended December 31, 2019 in revenues from principal transactions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company carried back net operating losses that were created prior to 2020 which was subsequently used to offset years with taxable income that was derived from a different corporate tax rate.\nOn February 19, 2020, the Company suspended its quarterly cash distributions program on outstanding shares.\nCompensation is accrued with specific ratios of total compensation and benefits to total revenues applied to specific revenue categories, with adjustments made if, in management's opinion, such adjustments are necessary and appropriate to maintain competitive compensation levels.\nOn March 19, 2019, the Company sold a 50.1% equity interest in JMP Credit Advisors LLC (\"JMPCA\") to Medalist Partners LP ( Medalist\u201d), an alternative asset management firm specializing in structured credit and asset-backed lending, and a 4.9% interest to management employees of JMPCA. JMP Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, retained 45.0% of the equity interest in JMPCA. The sale of JMPCA was considered a reconsideration event as defined in Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) 810, Consolidation, which requires a new consolidation analysis, and the Company determined that JMPCA is a VIE after the transaction date. The Company determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of JMPCA as we are not the party with the power to direct the most significant activities of JMPCA. As the Company was determined to not be the primary beneficiary, the Company deconsolidated JMPCA as of the date of sale. As the Company still retains 45.0% of the equity interest of JMPCA and has significant influence, the Company has determined that it will account for its retained interest as an equity method investment after the date of deconsolidation, however; the Company has made the election to use the fair value option to account for the investment. The Company received a cash payment of $0.3 million in consideration for the limited liability company interest and recorded a gain of $3.4 million on deconsolidation as revenue from principal transactions. The transaction agreement also required Medalist to provide additional capital to purchase an equity interest in JMP Credit Advisors CLO VI Long-Term Warehouse Ltd (the \"CLO VI warehouse\") to finance the acquisition of broadly syndicated corporate loans, which resulted in Medalist related entities purchasing approximately 66% of the outstanding equity of the CLO VI warehouse. The Company will receive a portion of the subordinated management fees from the CLOs JMPCA managed as of the date of the sale. After the sale, JMPCA was renamed Medalist Partners Corporate Finance LLC ( MPCF\u201d).\nWe earn asset management fees for managing a family of investment partnerships, including hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, a capital debt fund, as well as a publicly traded specialty finance company, Harvest Capital Credit Corporation (\"HCC\"). These fees include base management fees and incentive fees. Base management fees are generally determined by the fair value of the assets under management (\"AUM\") or the aggregate capital commitment and the fee schedule for each fund or account. Incentive fees are based upon the investment performance of the funds or accounts. For most of our funds, incentive fees equate to a percentage of the excess investment return above a specified high-water mark or hurdle rate over a defined period of time. For private equity funds, incentive fees equate to a percentage of the realized gain from the disposition of each portfolio investment in which each investor participates, which we earn after returning contributions by an investor for a portfolio investment. Some of these incentive fees are subject to contingent repayments to investors or clawback and cannot be recognized until it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. Any such fees earned are deferred for revenue recognition until the contingency is removed or the Company determines that it is not probable that a significant reversal of revenue will occur.\nUpon the securitization of Medalist Partners Corporate Finance CLO VI in February 2020, the Company received $13.7 million in cash from the CLO VI warehouse and recognized a gain of $1.0 million.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions using a two-step process: (i) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that each tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position; and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nInvestment Banking\nOther Income\n\nUnder a Revolving Note and Cash Subordination Agreement (as amended, the Revolving Note Agreement\u201d) and related Revolving Note (as amended, the Revolving Note\u201d), each dated April 8, 2011, JMP Securities holds a $20.0 million revolving line of credit with CNB to be used for regulatory capital purposes in connection with its securities underwriting activities. Advances under the Revolving Note Agreement bear interest at CNB's announced prime interest rate. The unused portion of the line bears interest at the rate of 0.25% per annum, paid monthly.\nA specific reserve is provided for loans that are considered impaired. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We measure impairment of a loan based upon either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, if the loan is collateral-dependent, depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy.\nAdministration\nRecent Developments\nPrior to the sale of the majority equity interest in JMPCA, the asset management fees for the CLOs under management during the period consisted only of senior and subordinated base management fees. We recognized base management fees for the CLOs on a monthly basis over the period during which the collateral management services are performed. The base management fees for the CLOs were calculated as a percentage of the average aggregate collateral balances for a specified period. As we consolidated the CLOs, the management fees earned at JMPCA from the CLOs were eliminated on consolidation in accordance with GAAP. For the period from January 1, 2019 through January 17, 2019 (deconsolidation date), the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO III were 0.35% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the period from January 1, 2019 through March 19, 2019 (deconsolidation date) , the contractual base and subordinated fees earned from CLO IV were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the period from January 1, 2019 through March 19, 2019 (deconsolidation date), the contractual base and subordinated fees earned from CLO V were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the period from January 1, 2019 through March 19, 2019 (deconsolidation date), the contractual base and subordinated fees earned from CLO VI warehouse portfolio were 1.0% of the average equity contributions.\n\nOperating Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the Company's GAAP net income as follows:\nThe following summarized financial information presents the information of JMP Group LLC, JMP Investment Holdings LLC and JMP Group Inc. on a combined basis and eliminates intercompany balances. It does not include or present investments in subsidiaries that are not an issuer or guarantor. One of the non-guarantor subsidiaries not combined, JMP Securities, is subject to certain regulations, which require the maintenance of minimum net capital. This requirement may limit the issuer's access to this subsidiary's assets.\nInterest income primarily consists of interest income earned on loans collateralizing ABS issued (through March 2019), investments in CLO debt securities, and loans held for investment. Interest income on loans is comprised of the stated coupon as a percentage of the face amount receivable as well as accretion of purchase discounts and deferred fees. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis, in accordance with the terms of the respective loans, unless such loans are placed on non-accrual status. Interest on CLO debt securities are recognized in interest income using the effective yield method.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the loan covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nTravel and Business Development\n \u2022 equity research coverage of three target industries; \nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n (v) reverses net unrealized gains and losses on strategic equity investments and certain warrant positions; \nIn the section that follows, we discuss the significant changes in the components of our balance sheet, cash flows, and capital resources and liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2020 to demonstrate where our capital is invested and the financial condition of the Company.\nCompensation and benefits, which includes employee payroll, taxes and benefits, performance-based cash bonus and commissions, as well as equity-based compensation to our employees and managing directors, increased $17.8 million, or 23.1%, from $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $95.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn January 17, 2019, the non-call period of JMP Credit Advisors CLO III(R) Ltd. ( CLO III\u201d) expired, which resulted in a change in the entity with the control over the most significant activities of the variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d). The expiration of the non-call period resulted in the Company losing control over the most significant activities of CLO III. The Company deconsolidated CLO III as of January 17, 2019. The Company continues to hold approximately 47% of the outstanding junior subordinated notes of CLO III and the Company accounts for its ownership of the CLO III subordinated notes as an investment in a CLO debt security. The Company recognized a gain of $1.6 million as revenue from principal transactions on the deconsolidation of CLO III for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 asset management products and services to institutional investors, high net-worth individuals and for our own account; and \nThe Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by all of the Company's other wholly owned subsidiaries (other than JMP Securities and certain dormant subsidiaries) and are secured by substantially all of its and the guarantors' assets. In addition, we have entered into a limited recourse pledge agreement with CNB whereby JMP Group LLC granted a lien on the equity interests in JMP Investment Holdings LLC and JMPAM to secure the Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement. In July 2020, the Company earned into a Seventh Amendment to its Credit Facility with CNB, that among other things, requires the Company maintain a minimum of $6.0 million of CLO debt securities, based on their fair value as of June 30, 2020 pledged as collateral supporting the obligations under the Credit Agreement. See Note 9, Loans, for more information on the Seventh Amendment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our material indebtedness consisted of our then outstanding Senior Notes and borrowing on our revolving line of credit with City National Bank ( CNB\u201d) under the Credit Agreement described below.\nA summary of the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, and for comparable prior periods, is set forth below.\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We regard an accounting estimate or assumption to be most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations where:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nBrokerage, clearing, and exchange fees include the cost of floor and electronic brokerage and execution, securities clearance, and exchange fees. Changes in brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees fluctuate largely in line with the volume of our sales and trading activity.\nOn December 23, 2020, HCC and Portman Ridge Finance Corporation ( PTMN\u201d) announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which HCC will merge with and into PTMN, a business development company managed by Sierra Crest Investment Management LLC ( Sierra Crest\u201d), an affiliate of BC Partners Advisors L.P. The parties currently expect the transaction to be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2021. The Company's partially-owned subsidiary HCAP Advisors provides investment advisory services to HCC. In addition, the Company had investments in HCC common stock of $7.5 million as of December 31, 2020. In connection with the above transaction, HCC stockholders will receive aggregate consideration equal to HCC's net asset value at closing. This consideration will be funded using PTMN shares (valued at 100% of PTMN's net asset value per share at the time of closing of the transaction) and, to the extent the required number of PTMN shares exceeds 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of PTMN common stock immediately prior to the transaction closing, cash consideration in the amount of such excess. As described below, HCAP stockholders will have an opportunity, subject to certain limitations, to elect to receive either cash or PTMN shares in consideration for their HCAP shares. Additionally, all HCAP stockholders will receive an additional cash payment from Sierra Crest of $2.15 million in the aggregate, or approximately $0.36 per share.\nCompensation and Benefits\nFees reported as asset management fees were $8.3 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, asset management revenues decreased from 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 7.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Fees reported as other income were $3.7 million and $2.4 million for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, other income were 3.2% and 2.4% for both of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDepreciation\nManagement uses Operating Net Income as a key, non-GAAP metric when evaluating the performance of JMP Group LLC's core business strategy and ongoing operations, as management believes that this metric appropriately illustrates the operating results of JMP Group LLC's core operations and business activities. Operating Net Income is derived from our segment reported results and is the measure of segment profitability on an after-tax basis used by management to evaluate our performance. This non-GAAP measure is presented to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance. Additionally, management believes that Operating Net Income is a useful measure because it allows for a better evaluation of the performance of JMP Group LLC's ongoing business and facilitates a meaningful comparison of the Company's results in a given period to those in prior and future periods.\nOther JMP Group LLC considerations\nNon-controlling interest represents the pro rata share of the income or loss partially-owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements.\nBrokerage, Clearing and Exchange Fees\nWe had total restricted cash of $1.2 million comprised primarily of restricted cash at JMP Group Inc. related to the Company's letters of credit on leasing arrangements.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli by the U.S. government spurred a sharp recovery in U.S. equity prices directly. The U.S. equities market continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second half of 2020. The Company's equity capital markets and brokerage revenues directly benefited from the improved capital market condition.\nOn an operating basis, as a percentage of total adjusted net revenues, principal transaction revenues decreased from 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net liquid assets of $108.0 million consisting of cash and cash equivalents, receivable from clearing broker, marketable securities owned, investment banking fee receivable, net of marketable securities sold but not yet purchased and accrued compensation. We have satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of the Senior Notes, draws on a line of credit and internally generated cash from operations. Most of our financial instruments, other than certain marketable securities, are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value.\nExpenses\n \u2022 the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and \nOther operating expenses primarily include occupancy, depreciation, and administration expense.\nThe following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.\nThe Company measures fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures with respect to fair value measurements. The accounting principles related to fair value measurement apply to all financial instruments that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis. This includes those items currently reported in marketable securities owned, at fair value, other investments and marketable securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nBrokerage Revenues\nUnfunded commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower, provided that all conditions have been met. The Company had no material unfunded commitments to lend at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nPrincipal Transactions\n*Operating Net Income (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure. See the section titled Operating Net Income (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) for more information about this non-GAAP measure, including a reconciliation to net income (loss).\n (ii) recognizes 100% of the cost of deferred compensation in the period for which such compensation was awarded, instead of recognizing such cost over the vesting period as required under GAAP, in order to match compensation expense with the actual period upon which the compensation was based; \nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, certain costs declined in 2020 as the underlying activities are restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel and related expenses. In addition, after a careful review of our cost structure, we reduced headcount modestly during the quarter ended September 30, 2020. While the headcount reduction resulted in recognition of severance costs, the reduced ongoing cost should increase cash flows in the future periods. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our liquidity in future periods still remains uncertain.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\nOccupancy\nThe timing of bonus compensation payments to our employees may significantly affect our cash position and liquidity from period to period. While our employees and managing directors are generally paid semi-monthly during the year, bonus compensation, which makes up a larger portion of total compensation, is generally paid once a year during the first two months of the following year. In the first two months of 2020, we paid out $26.9 million of cash bonuses for 2019, including employer payroll tax expense.", "item_7_text": "Managed deal expenses primarily relate to costs incurred and/or allocated in the execution of investment banking transactions, including reimbursable costs. Under the new revenue standard ASC 606, reimbursed costs are presented as revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense related to ABS issued and CLO warehouse credit facilities (through March 2019), Senior Notes, lines of credit, and notes payable, as well as the amortization of bond issuance costs. Interest expense on ABS is the stated coupon payable as a percentage of the principal amount payable adjusted for amortization of any discounts. Interest expense is recorded on an accrual basis, in accordance with the terms of the respective debt instruments.\n\nCLO Debt Securities\nAsset Management Fees\nOperating Results\nLoss on sale, payoff, and mark-to-market of loans consists of gains and losses from the sale and payoff of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities (\"ABS\", through March 2019). Gains are recorded when the proceeds exceed the carrying value of the loan.\n\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, and are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nComponents of Revenues\nWe earn revenues from securities offerings in which we act as an underwriter, such as initial public offerings and follow-on equity offerings. Underwriting revenues include management fees, underwriting fees, selling concessions, and realized and unrealized net gains and losses on equity positions held in inventory for a period of time to facilitate the completion of certain underwritten offerings. We record underwriting revenues, gross of related syndicate expenses, on the trade date which is typically the date of pricing an offering (or the following day). The Company has determined that its performance obligations are completed and the related income is reasonably determinable on the trade date. In syndicated transactions, management estimates our share of transaction-related expenses incurred by the syndicate, and we recognize revenues gross of such expense. On final settlement by the lead manager, typically 90 days from the trade date of the transaction, we adjust these amounts to reflect the actual transaction-related expenses and our resulting underwriting fee. We receive a higher proportion of total fees in underwritten transactions in which we act as a lead manager.\nInvestment Banking\nComponents of Expenses\nThere was no borrowing on the Revolving Note as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nCommunications and Technology\nOther income includes revenues from equity method investments, revenues from fee-sharing arrangements with our funds, contingent revenue from a sale of a general partnership, subordinated management fees earned on CLO investments, and fees earned to raise capital for third-party investment partnerships.\nThe following table reconciles consolidated net loss attributable to JMP Group LLC to total Operating Net Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company's policy for recording interest and penalties associated with the tax audits or unrecognized tax benefits, if any, is to record such items as a component of income tax.\nInvestment banking revenues, earned in our Broker-Dealer segment, increased $34.7 million, or 52.8%, from $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $100.4 million for the same period in 2020. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, investment banking revenues increased from 65.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 86.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an operating basis, investment banking revenues were 72.1% and 61.7% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as a percentage of adjusted net revenues.\nOn June 29, 2020, JMP Securities entered Amendment Number Eleven to the Revolving Note Agreement. Pursuant to this amendment, the $20.0 million Revolving Note Agreement was extended for one year until June 30, 2021. On June 20, 2021, any existing outstanding amount under the Revolving Note will convert to a term loan maturing the following year.\nTotal segment asset management-related fees include base management fees and incentive fees from our assets under management, as well as other income from fee-sharing arrangements with, and fees earned to raise capital for, third-party or equity-method investment partnerships or funds. Total segment asset management-related fee revenues are reconciled to the GAAP measure, total asset management fee revenues, in the table above. We believe that presenting operating asset management-related fees is useful to investors as a means of assessing the performance of our combined asset management activities, including fundraising and other services for third parties. We also believe that asset management-related fee revenue is a more meaningful measure than standalone asset management fees as reported, because asset management-related fee revenues represent the combined impact of the various asset management activities on the Company's total net revenues.\nWe earn base management fees from the investment partnerships that we manage generally based on the net assets of the underlying partnerships. In addition, we are entitled to allocations of the appreciation and depreciation in the fair value of the underlying partnerships from our general partnership interests in the partnerships. Such allocations are based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements.\nSenior Notes\nBrokerage, Clearing, and Exchange Fees\nThe redemption provisions of our funds require at least 90 days' advance notice. Redemptions are not permitted in our private equity funds or our private debt capital vehicles. The redemption provisions do not apply to the CLOs.\nRevenues\nLoss on repurchase, reissuance, or early retirement of debt primarily consists of losses incurred in the write-off of debt issuance costs related to Senior Notes that have been repurchased or retired sooner than the life of the instrument.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Borrower had drawn $6.0 million against the Revolver and had letters of credit outstanding under this facility to support office lease obligations of approximately $1.1 million in the aggregate.\n\nOur brokerage revenues include trading commissions paid by customers for purchases or sales of exchange-listed and over-the-counter equity securities. Commissions resulting from equity securities transactions executed on behalf of customers are recorded on a trade date basis. The Company believes that the performance obligation is satisfied on the trade date because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer. Brokerage revenues also include net trading gains and losses that result from market-making activities and from our commitment of capital to facilitate customer transactions. Our brokerage revenues may vary between periods, in part depending on commission rates, trading volumes and our ability to deliver equity research and other value-added services to our clients. The ability to execute trades electronically, through the internet and through other alternative trading systems, has increased pressure on trading commissions and spreads across our industry. We expect this trend toward alternative trading systems and the related pricing pressure in the brokerage business to continue. We are, to some extent, compensated through brokerage commissions for the equity research and other value-added services we deliver to our clients. These soft dollar\u201d practices have been the subject of discussion among regulators, the investment banking community and our sales and trading clients. In particular, commission sharing arrangements have been adopted by some large institutional investors. In these arrangements, an institutional investor concentrates its trading with fewer execution\u201d brokers and pays a fixed amount for execution, with a designated amount set aside for payments to other firms for research or other brokerage services. Accordingly, trading volume directed to us by investors that enter into such arrangements may be reduced, or eliminated, but we may be compensated for our research and sales efforts through allocations of the designated amounts. Depending on the extent to which we agree to this practice and depending on our ability to enter into arrangements on terms acceptable to us, this trend would likely impair the revenues and profitability of our brokerage business by negatively affecting both volumes and trading commissions.\nJMP Securities, our wholly-owned subsidiary and a registered securities broker-dealer, is subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to 1. JMP Securities had net capital of $42.3 million and $16.9 million, which were $40.6 million and $15.5 million in excess of the required net capital of $1.7 million and $1.4 million, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. JMP Securities' ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 0.62 to 1 and 1.25 to 1 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nItem 7.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $86.0 million of bonds payable were outstanding, of which $36.0 million carries interest at a rate of 6.875% per annum and is due in 2029 and the remaining $50.00 million carries interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum and is due in 2027. The bonds require quarterly payments of interest.\nTotal segment principal transaction revenues decreased from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $6.2 million for the same period in 2020. Total segment principal transaction revenues are a non-GAAP financial measure that aggregates our segment reported principal transaction revenues across each segment. The principal transaction revenues for both 2020 and 2019 were included in our Investment Income segment. Total segment principal transaction revenues are reconciled to the GAAP measure, total principal transaction revenues, in the table below. See the Operating Net Income section above for additional information on the adjustments made to arrive at the non-GAAP measure and why management believes that this non-GAAP number is useful and important to the users of these financial statements.\n \u2022 management of collateralized loan obligations (through March 19, 2019) and a specialty finance company. \nMost of our financial instruments are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Marketable securities owned, other investments, including warrant positions and investments in partnerships in which HCS is the general partner, and marketable securities sold, but not yet purchased, are stated at fair value, with related changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in the line item Principal transactions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOther Expenses\nThe Company's policy for recording interest and penalties associated with the tax audits or unrecognized tax benefits, if any, is to record such items as a component of income tax.\nNet Interest Income/Expense\n (vii) reverses the one-time transaction costs related to the refinancing or repurchase of the debt\u037e (viii) includes a combined federal, state and local income tax rate of 26% at the consolidated taxable parent company, JMP Group LLC\u037e (xi) presents revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates the CLOs (through March 19, 2019) and removes any non-controlling interest in consolidated but less than wholly owned subsidiaries; and (x) excludes a charge recorded in connection with severance costs deriving from a strategic restructuring and reduction in headcount in September 2020. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPrincipal Transactions\nCommunications and technology expense primarily relates to the cost of communication and connectivity, information processing and subscriptions to certain market data feeds and services.\nThe Company, is a diversified capital markets firm headquartered in San Francisco, California. We have a diversified business model with a focus on small and middle-market companies and provide:\nJMP Securities' obligations under the Revolving Note Agreement are guaranteed by all of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries (other than JMP Securities and certain dormant subsidiaries) and are secured by substantially all the guarantors' assets.\nProvision for loan losses includes the provision for losses recognized on loans held for investment in order to record those loans at their estimated net realizable value. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that is intended to estimate loan losses inherent in individual loans or in the homogenous loan portfolio. A provision for loan losses is charged to expense to establish the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level, in the opinion of management, sufficient to offset estimated losses inherent in individual loans or in the homogenous loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements. The appropriateness of the allowance and the allowance components are reviewed quarterly. Our estimate of each allowance component is based on observable information and on market and third-party data that we believe are reflective of the underlying loan losses being estimated. We employ internally developed and third-party estimation tools for measuring credit risk.\nProfessional fees primarily relate to legal and accounting professional services.\nCash increased by $81.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of cash used in operating, investing and financing activities.\nIn March 2020, the Company repurchased $1.4 million and $0.7 million par value of its issued and outstanding 2029 Senior Notes and 2027 Senior Notes, respectively. Since they were repurchased at less than carrying value, a gain of $0.7 million was recognized upon the repurchase of the bonds, which has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, gain on repurchase, reissuance or early retirement of debt.\nAdministration expense was $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, administration expense decreased from 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 5.7% for the same period in 2020.\nUnderwriting Revenues\nOur operating activities used $18.9 million of cash from the net loss of $6.6 million, adjusted for the cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $11.7 million, and used by non-cash revenue and expense items of $0.6 million. The cash used in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation of $11.1 million, an increase in other assets of $9.5 million, an increase of $4.1 million in interest payable, an increase in interest receivable of $5.0 million, partially offset by a $16.1 million decrease in marketable securities owned.\nCommunications and technology expenses were $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, communications and technology expense increased to 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\nBrokerage Revenues\nGain (Loss) on Repurchase, Reissuance, or Early Retirement of Debt\nJMP Group Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of JMP Group LLC, is the primary obligor of the Company's 7.25% Senior Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Senior Notes\u201d) (see Note 6, Loans). Pursuant to the indenture of the 2027 Senior Notes, JMP Group LLC and JMP Investment Holdings LLC (the Guarantors\u201d) are the guarantors of the 2027 Senior Notes. The Guarantors jointly and severally provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the due and punctual payment of the principal and interest on the 2027 Senior Notes and the due and punctual payment or performance of all other obligations of JMP Group Inc. under the indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes.\nThe increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 41.9% increase in equity and debt origination revenues as JMP executed 101 deals in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 78 for the same period in 2019. We also saw a 72.3% increase in strategic advisory and private placements revenues, which increased from $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The number of transactions in which we acted as a bookrunning manager was 9 and 19 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n \u2022 investment banking services, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and other strategic advisory services, to corporate clients; \nCompensation and benefits as a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses increased from 77.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 82.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n.\nTravel and Business Development\nOn May 13, 2019, the Company launched a self-tender offer (the Tender Offer\u201d) to repurchase for cash up to 3,000,000 of shares representing limited liability company interests of the Company. On June 13, 2019, the Company repurchased 1,816,732 shares under the Tender Offer at a price $3.95 per share for a total purchase price of $7.2 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the Tender Offer.\nNon-controlling Interest\nProfessional Fees\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nPrincipal transaction revenues include realized and unrealized net gains and losses resulting from our principal investments in equity, CLO and other debt securities. Principal transaction revenues also include unrealized net gains and losses resulting from our principal investments in various investment funds managed by the Company or by third parties.\nLoss on Sale, Payoff, and Mark-to-Market of Loans\nNet Dividend Income\nInterest income on CLO debt securities is recognized in accordance with ASC 835, using the effective yield method. The effective yield on these securities is based on the projected cash flows from each security, which is estimated based on the Company's observation of the then current information and events, where applicable, and will include assumptions related to interest rates, prepayment rates and the timing and amount of credit losses. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company reviews and, if appropriate, makes adjustments to its cash flow projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and its judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in the yield/interest income recognized on such securities. Realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method and recognized in current period earnings in revenues from principal transactions.\nTravel and business development expense primarily consists of costs incurred traveling to client locations for the purposes of executing transactions or meeting potential new clients, travel for administrative functions, and other costs incurred in developing new business. Travel costs related to existing clients for mergers and acquisitions and underwriting deals are sometimes reimbursed by clients. Under the new revenue standard ASC 606, reimbursed costs are presented as revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Election for JMP Group LLC to be Taxed as a C Corporation\nIncome Taxes\nHowever, Operating Net Income should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with GAAP. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that, unless otherwise indicated, the adjustments concern gains, losses or expenses that JMP Group LLC generally expects to continue to recognize, and the adjustment of these items should not always be construed as an inference that these gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, management believes that both JMP Group LLC's GAAP measures of its financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together. Operating Net Income may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies.\nOccupancy expenses were $4.8 and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, occupancy expenses were 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and were 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nManaged Deal Expenses\nBecause of the nature of our investment banking and sales and trading businesses, liquidity is important to us. Accordingly, we regularly monitor our liquidity position, including our cash and net capital positions. We believe that our available liquidity and current level of equity capital, combined with the funds anticipated to be provided by our operating activities, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and regulatory capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. If circumstances required it, we could improve our liquidity position by discontinuing repurchases of the Company's common shares, halting cash distributions on our common shares and reducing cash bonus compensation paid.\nThe Credit Agreement provides a $25.0 million revolving line of credit (the Revolver\u201d) through December 31, 2022 bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 225 bps.\nEquity-based compensation was $1.7 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nJMP Holding LLC Credit Agreement with CNB\nUsing the foregoing criteria, we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies:\nWe classify our expenses as compensation and benefits; administration; brokerage, clearing and exchange fees; travel and business development; managed deal expenses, communications and technology; occupancy; professional fees, depreciation, and other. A significant portion of our expense base is variable, including compensation and benefits; brokerage, clearing and exchange fees; travel and business development; managed deal expenses, communication and technology expenses.\n (vi) reverses impairment of CLO debt securities recognized in principal transaction revenues, as the Company believes that the forecasted reduction in future cash flows will be mitigated by a change in the interest rate environment and that distributions will be larger than currently projected; \nThe Company uses the fair value option which allows an entity to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. The fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been chosen is reflected on the face of the balance sheet. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDiscussed below is our Operating Net Income (Loss) by segment. This information is reflected in a manner utilized by management to assess the financial operations of the Company's various business lines.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not repurchase any of the Company's shares.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $91.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $17.9 million in undrawn borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit (some of which borrowing capacity may be used for working capital - See the section entitled JMP Holding LLC Credit Agreement with CNB, below). Based on our historical results, management's experience and our current business strategy, we believe that our existing cash resources and available credit will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nInterest Income\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nJMP Securities LLC Revolving Note Agreement with CNB\nSummarized Financial Information\nResults of Operations\n\nTotal segment net interest income decreased $8.4 million from $5.3 million the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by the deconsolidation of the CLOs in the first quarter of 2019. Net interest income is earned in our Investment Income segment. Total segment net interest income after deconsolidation reflects the effective yield of the Company's ownership of subordinated notes in CLO III, CLO IV, and CLO V, net of bond interest expense. Total segment net interest income is reconciled to the GAAP measure, total net interest income, in the table above. As a percentage of total adjusted net revenues, net interest income was 1.3% and 5.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nStrategic Advisory Revenues\nIf a potential adverse contingency should become probable or resolved for an amount in excess of the established reserves during any period, our results of operations in that period and, in some cases, succeeding periods, could be adversely affected.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table represents a summary of the Company's client assets under management with respect to the assets managed by HCS, JMP Asset Management LLC ( JMPAM\u201d), HCAP Advisors LLC ( HCAP Advisors\u201d) and assets managed by sponsored funds:\nWe continue to closely monitor the status of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, the economy and capital markets globally. An economic recession could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. While we are optimistic that the equity market could remain active through year-end, we cannot reliably estimate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business in the 4th quarter and beyond.\nDepreciation\nManaged deal expenses\nOn January 30, 2020, the spread of novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d). Subsequently, on March 11, 2020, WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. In March 2020, the U.S. equities market saw sharp declines and extreme volatility in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur strategic advisory revenues primarily consist of success fees received upon the closing of mergers and acquisitions but also include retainer fees received when we are first engaged to provide advisory services. We also earn fees for related advisory work and other services, such as fairness opinions, valuation analyses, due diligence, and pre-transaction structuring advice. These revenues may be earned for providing services to either the buyer or the seller involved in a transaction. Depending on the nature of the engagement letter and the agreed upon services, customers may simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of services or services may culminate in the delivery of the advisory services at a point in time. The Company evaluates each contract individually and the performance obligations identified to determine if revenue should be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement or at a specific point in time. Any retainer fees received in connection with these agreements are individually evaluated and any unearned fees are deferred for revenue recognition.\nOn February 24, 2020 the Company launched a second self-tender offer (the Second Tender Offer\u201d) to repurchase for cash up to 3,000,000 of shares at $3.25 a share, representing limited liability company interests of the Company, which was terminated on March 19, 2020 as a result of multiple conditions to the Self Tender Offer not having been satisfied.\n (iv) unrealized gains or losses on commercial real estate investments, adjusted for non-cash expenditures, including depreciation and amortization; \n (1) For HCS, JMPAM, and HCAP Advisors, client assets under management represent the net assets of such funds or the commitment amount. (2) Sponsored funds are third-party asset managers in which the Company owns an economic interest. \nSegment income tax was an expense of $4.4 million and a benefit of $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. An effective tax rate of 26% is assumed for our taxable parent company, based on our best estimation of the subsidiary's average rate of taxation over the long term.\nOccupancy Expenses\nThe Credit Agreement provides that the Revolver may be used, on a revolving basis, to fund specified permitted investments in collateralized loan obligation vehicles. In addition, up to $5.0 million of the Revolver may be used, on a revolving basis, to fund other types of permitted investments and acquisitions and for working capital.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our aggregate minimum future commitment on our leases was $23.2 million. See Note 10 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nWe earn fees for private capital markets and other services in connection with transactions that are not underwritten, such as private placements of equity securities, PIPE transactions and Rule 144A offerings. We record private placement revenues on the closing date of these transactions. Client reimbursements for costs associated for private placement fees are recorded gross within Investment banking and various expense captions, excluding compensation.\nIncome tax benefit was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, while an income tax benefit of $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nPrivate Capital Markets and Other Revenues\nWe are also entitled to receive incentive fee allocations from the investment partnerships when the return exceeds a specified high-water mark or hurdle rate over a defined performance period. Incentive fees are recorded after the quarterly or annual investment performance period is complete and may vary depending on the terms of the fee structure applicable to an investor.\nWe earn investment banking revenues from underwriting securities offerings, arranging private capital markets transactions and providing advisory services in mergers and acquisitions and other strategic transactions.\nOperating Net Income (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nOn December 31, 2020, the Borrower entered into an Amendment Number Eight (the Eighth Amendment\u201d) to that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2014 among the Borrower, the Lenders and CNB. The Eighth Amendment extended the outside maturity date of the Revolving Loan under the Credit Facility from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2022 and removed the mechanism whereby the Revolving Loan would convert into a term loan for 12 months after the revolving period ends. The Eighth Amendment amended certain financial covenants and introduced a definition of Borrowing Base\u201d, which is a sum of certain assets of the Loan Parties, and added a provision that caps the total amount that can be borrowed under the Revolving Loan to the amount of the Borrowing Base if the Borrowing Base is lower than the Maximum Revolver Amount of $25 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Borrowing Base exceeded $25 million.\nWe had no other material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020. However, through indemnification provisions in our clearing agreements with our clearing broker, customer activities may expose us to off-balance sheet credit risk, which we seek to mitigate through customer screening and collateral requirements.\n</table>\nTravel and business development expenses decreased $4.0 million, from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by lower volume of business travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, travel and business development expense was 1.1% and 5.2% and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCommunications and Technology\nOur operating activities provided $27.1 million of cash from the net loss of $7.8 million, adjusted for the cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of $35.8 million, and used by non-cash revenue and expense items of $0.9 million. The cash provided by operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities of $23.6 million, an increase in accrued compensation of $16.1 million, partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease in receivables.\nOverview\nDepreciation expenses were $1.5 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, depreciation was 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted in response to market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes many measures to help companies, including changes that are temporary and non-income based tax laws, some of which were part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The Company has made reasonable assessments in accounting for certain effects of the CARES Act that was passed. However, the provisional impacts may be refined over the prescribed measurement period.\n \u2022 the impact of the estimates or assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material. \nInvestments in CLO debt securities are classified and accounted for according to their purpose and holding period. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of the Company's investments in CLO debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities may be sold before maturity and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d).\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet dividend income includes dividends from our investments offset by dividend expense resulting from short positions in our principal investment portfolio.\nBrokerage revenues earned in our Broker-Dealer segment were $18.9 million and $17.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Brokerage revenues decreased as a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, from 17.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 16.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an operating basis, brokerage revenues were 13.6% and 16.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as a percentage of adjusted net revenues.\nThese disclosures are in accordance with the new disclosure requirements under SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 and Rule 13-02 issued in March 2020. The amended financial disclosures will consist of summarized financial information, as defined in Rule 1-02(bb)(1) of Regulation S-X, of the issuers and guarantors, which may be presented on a combined basis, and reduce the number of periods presented. The amended non-financial disclosures, among other matters, will expand the qualitative disclosures about the guarantees and the issuers and guarantors. Consistent with the existing rule, disclosure of additional information about each guarantor will be required if it would be material for investors to evaluate the sufficiency of the guarantee. We have early adopted these disclosure rules. The tables below present summarized financial information as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOverview\nDepreciation expenses include the straight-line amortization of purchases of certain furniture and fixtures, computer and office equipment, certain software costs, and leasehold improvements to allocate their depreciation amounts over their estimated useful life.\nCash increased by $41.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of cash used in operating, investing and financing activities.\nAs of January 31, 2019, the Company filed an election with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes, rather than a partnership, going forward. The election was approved and became retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019.\nLiquidity Considerations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 the contractual base management fees earned from each of our investment funds or companies ranged between 1% and 2% of AUM or were between 1% and 2% of aggregate committed capital. The contractual incentive fees were generally 20%, subject to high-water marks, for the hedge funds; 5% to 20%, subject to high-water marks or a performance hurdle rate, for the hedge funds of funds; 20%, subject to high-water marks, for Harvest Growth Capital LLC ( HGC\u201d), Harvest Growth Capital II LLC ( HGC II\u201d) and Harvest Growth Capital III LLC ( HGC III\u201d); and 30% for JMP Capital I LLC (\"JMP Capital I\"). Our asset management revenues are subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors that are unpredictable, including the overall condition of the economy, the securities markets as a whole and our core sectors. These market and industry conditions can have a material effect on the inflows and outflows of AUM and on the performance of our asset management funds. For example, a significant portion of the performance-based or incentive fee revenues that we recognize are based on the value of securities held in the funds we manage. The value of these securities includes unrealized gains or losses that may change from one period to another.\nProfessional fees were $3.7 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, professional fees were 3.2% and 4.4% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEmployee payroll, taxes and benefits, and consultant fees were $40.8 million and $42.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Performance-based bonus and commission increased $19.3 million from $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe are involved in various pending and potential claims, arbitrations, legal actions, investigations and proceedings related to our business from time to time. Some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts, including claims for punitive and other special damages. The number of claims, legal actions, investigations and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions like us has been increasing in recent years. We have, after consultation with counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management, recorded estimated losses in accordance with authoritative guidance under GAAP on contingencies, to the extent that a claim may result in a probable loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management and our ultimate liabilities may be materially different. In making these determinations, management considers many factors, including, but not limited to, the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant, the basis and validity of the claim, the likelihood of successful defense against the claim and the potential for, and magnitude of, damages or settlements from such pending and potential claims, legal actions, arbitrations, investigations and proceedings, and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies.\n\n \u2022 sales and trading and related securities brokerage services to institutional investors; \nCompensation and benefits is the largest component of our expenses and includes employees' base pay, performance bonuses, sales commissions, related payroll taxes, and medical and benefits expenses, as well as expenses for contractors, temporary employees, and equity-based compensation. Our employees receive a substantial portion of their compensation in the form of an individual, performance-based bonus. As is the widespread practice in our industry, we pay bonuses, for the most part, on an annual basis, and for senior professionals these bonuses typically make up a large portion of their total compensation. A portion of the performance-based bonuses paid to certain senior professionals is paid in the form of deferred compensation. Bonus payments may have a greater impact on our cash position and liquidity in the periods in which they are paid than would otherwise be reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We accrue for the estimated amount of these bonus payments ratably over the applicable service period.\nOn January 4, 2021, the Company announced that JMP Group Inc. gave notice of its intention to redeem $10.0 million principal amount of the 2027 Notes which was completed on February 4, 2021.\nOur investing activities provided $12.7 million of cash primarily due to $15.0 million from the sale of other investments, partially offset by the $2.0 million used to purchase other investments.\n\nOccupancy costs primarily include payments made under operating leases that are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease and the accretion of any lease incentives.\nAsset Management Fees\nThe tables below present summarized financial information as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAt both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, JMP Securities was in compliance with the loan covenants under the Revolving Note Agreement.\nOur financing activities used $2.5 million of cash primarily due to $35.9 million repayment on bonds payable, $10.6 million of repayment on line of credit, and $8.6 million repurchase of common shares for treasury, partially offset by cash provided by $36.0 in proceeds from bond issuance and $16.6 million in proceeds from line of credit.\nManaged deal expenses were $3.6 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total equity and debt origination revenues, managed deal expenses remained consistent at 6.0% percent and 7.4% for the years ended December 31 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nLegal and Other Contingent Liabilities\nProfessional Fees\nAn entity taxed as a partnership generally does not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability, and any income, gains, losses or deductions are taken in by the owners of the partnership in computing their U.S. federal income tax liability, regardless of any distributions from the partnership. In contrast, an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally pays U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income as it is considered a taxable entity. For years beginning after December 31, 2017, the maximum U.S. federal tax rate imposed on the net income of corporations is 21%. This rate may be subject to change in the future. Owners of a corporate entity generally do not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability on any earnings of the corporation unless the corporation makes a distribution of cash or property. Any distributions paid from current or accumulated earnings are treated as dividends, and these \"qualifying dividends\" are generally taxed at a lower rate than the ordinary income tax rate. For corporate entities, as both the corporation and distributions from the corporation are taxed, there are two levels of potential tax on the income earned.\nAdministration\nNon-Interest Expenses\nWe derive revenues primarily from: fees from our investment banking business, net commissions from our sales and trading business, management fees and incentive fees from our asset management business, and interest income earned on collateralized loan obligations we manage. We also generate revenues from principal transactions, interest, dividends and other income.\nFair value of our financial instruments is generally obtained from quoted market prices, third-party pricing services, or alternative pricing methodologies that we believe offer reasonable levels of price transparency. Valuations obtained from pricing services are considered reflective of executable prices. Data obtained from multiple sources are compared for consistency and reasonableness. To the extent that certain financial instruments trade infrequently or are non-marketable securities and, therefore, do not have readily determinable fair values, we estimate the fair value of these instruments using various pricing models and the information available to us that we deem most relevant. Among the factors considered by us in determining the fair value of financial instruments are discounted anticipated cash flows, the cost, terms and liquidity of the instrument, the financial condition, operating results and credit ratings of the issuer or underlying company, the quoted market price of publicly traded securities with similar duration and yield, the Black-Scholes Options Valuation methodology and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of financial instruments.\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2020\nMarketable securities owned and securities sold, but not yet purchased, consist of U.S. listed and over-the-counter equity securities. Other investments include investments in private investment funds managed by us or our affiliates, as well as cash paid for a subscription in a private investment fund managed by a third party. Such investments held by non-broker-dealer entities are accounted for under the equity method based on our share of the earnings (or losses) of the investee. The financial position and operating results of the private investment funds are generally determined on an estimated fair value basis. Generally, securities are valued (i) at their last published sale price if they are listed on an established exchange or (ii) if last sales prices are not published, at the highest closing bid\u201d price (for securities held long\u201d) and the lowest closing asked\u201d price (for short\u201d positions) as recorded by the composite tape system or such principal exchange, as the case may be. Where the general partner determines that market prices or quotations do not fairly represent the value of a security in the investment fund's portfolio (for example, if a security is a restricted security of a class that is publicly traded) the general partner may assign a different value. The general partner will determine the estimated fair value of any assets that are not publicly traded.\nCompensation and Benefits\nLoans which are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off, and the charged-off amount is deducted from the allowance.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its investments in private investment funds managed by third parties using the net asset value per share of those funds, as a practical expedient.\nThe Revolving Note Agreement contains financial and other covenants. A violation of any one of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Note, which would permit CNB to terminate the Revolving Note and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding principal and interest, subject to the terms of the Revolving Note Agreement.\n (iii) reverses amortization expense related to an intangible asset resulting from the repurchase of a portion of the equity of CLO III prior to March 2019; \nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The use of different estimates and assumptions could produce materially different results. For example, if factors such as those described under the caption Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements in our Annual Report cause actual events to differ from the assumptions we used in applying the accounting policies, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nAdministration expense primarily includes the cost of hosted conferences, non-capitalized systems and software expenditures, insurance, business tax (non-income), office supplies, recruiting, and regulatory fees.\nAsset Management Investment Partnerships\nTotal segment asset management related fee revenue increased $2.2 million, from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an operating basis, asset management related fee revenues were 7.7% and 8.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as a percentage of adjusted net revenues.\nSince our investment banking revenues are generally recognized at the time of completion of a transaction or the services to be performed, these revenues typically vary between periods and may be affected considerably by the timing of the closing of significant transactions.\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on debt, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of certain financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes an event of default for a change of control\u201d that tests, in part, the composition of our ownership and an event of default if three or more of the members of the Company's executive committee fail to be involved actively on an ongoing basis in the management of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. A violation of any one of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which would permit CNB to terminate our Revolver or Converted Term Loan and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding principal and interest. In addition, our subsidiaries are restricted under the Credit Agreement under certain circumstances from making distributions to us if an event of default has occurred under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company does not have a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020.\nIn November 2017, JMP Group Inc. raised $50.0 million from the issuance of 7.25% Senior Notes ( 2027 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2027 Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2027 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at JMP Group Inc.'s option on or after November 28, 2020 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2027 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year, payable quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year. Pursuant to the indenture of the 2027 Senior Notes, JMP Group LLC and JMP Investment Holdings LLC (the Guarantors\u201d) are the guarantors of the 2027 Senior Notes. The Guarantors jointly and severally provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the due and punctual payment of the principal and interest on the 2027 Senior Notes and the due and punctual payment or performance of all other obligations of JMP Group Inc. under the indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes.\nNet interest income decreased $3.7 million from $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of the CLOs in the first quarter of 2019. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, net interest income was 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPrincipal transaction revenues decreased $19.9 million, from a gain of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a loss of $18.5 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a $21.7 million impairment loss on CLO debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $4.2 million. In addition, we recognized a $3.4 million gain on deconsolidation of JMPCA in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.\nDeconsolidation of the CLOs and JMPCA\nJMP Holding LLC (the Borrower\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2014 among the Borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d) and CNB, as administrative agent for the Lenders (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d).\nThe Company evaluates the available-for-sale CLO debt securities for impairment quarterly. As part of the evaluation, the Company obtains the new cash flow projections for the CLO debt securities at period end and determines, based on those cash flows and other current information, if there has been a favorable or adverse change in the cash flows expected to be collected as compared to the projected cash flows from the prior period. An adverse change in cash flows is determined in the context of both the timing and the amount of the cash flows. An impairment would be recorded if the net present value of the cash flows of the investment is below the amortized cost basis of the investment and the Company does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis before the security is expected to be sold or the security matures, whichever comes first. Should the Company determine that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is recognized in revenues from principal transactions. The Company recorded $21.7 million of impairment on CLO debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019\nOur financing activities provided $2.0 million of cash primarily due to $3.8 million in proceeds from a Paycheck Protection Program loan, partially offset by $1.4 million in repurchase of bonds payable.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nInterest Expense\n (i) reverses compensation expense recognized under GAAP related to equity awards; \nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements affecting the Company, refer to Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nInvestments in partnerships include our general partnership and limited partnership interests in investment partnerships, managed by our asset management subsidiaries. Such investments are accounted for under the equity method based on our proportionate share of the earnings (or losses) of the investment partnership or under the fair value option using the net asset value per share of those funds, as a practical expedient. Under the fair value option, these interests are carried at estimated fair value based on our capital accounts in the underlying partnerships. The assets of the investment partnerships consist primarily of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities, real estate and real estate-related enterprises and corporate loans. The underlying investments held by such partnerships are valued based on quoted market prices or estimated fair value if there is no public market for such assets. Such estimates of fair value of the partnerships' non-marketable investments are ultimately determined by our asset management subsidiaries in their capacity as general partner. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation, fair values of these non-marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments, and the differences could be material. Adjustments to carrying value are made, as required by GAAP, if there are third-party transactions evidencing a change in value. Downward adjustments are also made, in the absence of third-party transactions, if the general partner determines that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value.\nA condensed table of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below.\nOur investing activities used $60.5 million of cash primarily due to a $35.2 million funding of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued, a $25.7 million of funding for loans held for investment, $12.6 million used to purchase other investments and a $27.8 million decrease in cash and restricted cash due to deconsolidation of subsidiaries, partially offset by the $23.8 million of receipts from loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued and $10.4 million from the sale of other investments.\nSince January 2015, JMP Group LLC had been a publicly traded partnership and, as such, was taxed as a partnership, and not as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income.\u201d On January 31, 2019, the Company filed an election with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes, rather than as a partnership, going forward. The election was approved and became retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019.\nIn September 2019, JMP Group LLC raised $36.0 million from the issuance of 6.875% Senior Notes ( 2029 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2029 Senior Notes will mature on September 30, 2029 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after September 30, 2021 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2029 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per year, payable quarterly on March 30, June 30, September 30, and December 30 of each year.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions using a two-step process: (i) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that each tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position; and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority\nBrokerage, clearing and exchange fees was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $2.6 million for the same period in 2020. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, our brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased from 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 2.3% for the same period in 2020.\nAfter the sale of JMPCA, the Company concluded that it has lost the ability to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs: JMP Credit Advisors CLO IV Ltd. ( CLO IV\u201d), JMP Credit Advisors CLO V Ltd. ( CLO V\u201d), and the CLO VI warehouse (collectively with CLO III the CLOs\u201d) and also deconsolidated those CLOs as of March 19, 2019. The Company continues to hold 100% of the junior subordinated notes of CLO IV and CLO V and approximately 33% of the equity interests of the CLO VI warehouse. The Company owned 100% and 25% of the senior subordinated notes in CLO IV and CLO V, respectively, at the date of deconsolidation. The Company sold all of its senior subordinated notes in CLO IV and CLO V in May 2019. The Company accounts for its ownership of the subordinated notes as a beneficial interest in a debt security and accounts for its equity interests of the CLO VI warehouse as an equity investment. The Company classifies the junior subordinated notes as available-for-sale securities and classified the senior subordinated notes as trading securities up until their sale. Collectively, the Company recognized a loss on the deconsolidation of CLO IV, CLO V, and CLO VI warehouse of $1.8 million and a loss of $0.1 million on the sale of the senior subordinated notes of CLO IV and CLO V for the year ended December 31, 2019 in revenues from principal transactions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company carried back net operating losses that were created prior to 2020 which was subsequently used to offset years with taxable income that was derived from a different corporate tax rate.\nOn February 19, 2020, the Company suspended its quarterly cash distributions program on outstanding shares.\nCompensation is accrued with specific ratios of total compensation and benefits to total revenues applied to specific revenue categories, with adjustments made if, in management's opinion, such adjustments are necessary and appropriate to maintain competitive compensation levels.\nOn March 19, 2019, the Company sold a 50.1% equity interest in JMP Credit Advisors LLC (\"JMPCA\") to Medalist Partners LP ( Medalist\u201d), an alternative asset management firm specializing in structured credit and asset-backed lending, and a 4.9% interest to management employees of JMPCA. JMP Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, retained 45.0% of the equity interest in JMPCA. The sale of JMPCA was considered a reconsideration event as defined in Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) 810, Consolidation, which requires a new consolidation analysis, and the Company determined that JMPCA is a VIE after the transaction date. The Company determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of JMPCA as we are not the party with the power to direct the most significant activities of JMPCA. As the Company was determined to not be the primary beneficiary, the Company deconsolidated JMPCA as of the date of sale. As the Company still retains 45.0% of the equity interest of JMPCA and has significant influence, the Company has determined that it will account for its retained interest as an equity method investment after the date of deconsolidation, however; the Company has made the election to use the fair value option to account for the investment. The Company received a cash payment of $0.3 million in consideration for the limited liability company interest and recorded a gain of $3.4 million on deconsolidation as revenue from principal transactions. The transaction agreement also required Medalist to provide additional capital to purchase an equity interest in JMP Credit Advisors CLO VI Long-Term Warehouse Ltd (the \"CLO VI warehouse\") to finance the acquisition of broadly syndicated corporate loans, which resulted in Medalist related entities purchasing approximately 66% of the outstanding equity of the CLO VI warehouse. The Company will receive a portion of the subordinated management fees from the CLOs JMPCA managed as of the date of the sale. After the sale, JMPCA was renamed Medalist Partners Corporate Finance LLC ( MPCF\u201d).\nWe earn asset management fees for managing a family of investment partnerships, including hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, a capital debt fund, as well as a publicly traded specialty finance company, Harvest Capital Credit Corporation (\"HCC\"). These fees include base management fees and incentive fees. Base management fees are generally determined by the fair value of the assets under management (\"AUM\") or the aggregate capital commitment and the fee schedule for each fund or account. Incentive fees are based upon the investment performance of the funds or accounts. For most of our funds, incentive fees equate to a percentage of the excess investment return above a specified high-water mark or hurdle rate over a defined period of time. For private equity funds, incentive fees equate to a percentage of the realized gain from the disposition of each portfolio investment in which each investor participates, which we earn after returning contributions by an investor for a portfolio investment. Some of these incentive fees are subject to contingent repayments to investors or clawback and cannot be recognized until it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. Any such fees earned are deferred for revenue recognition until the contingency is removed or the Company determines that it is not probable that a significant reversal of revenue will occur.\nUpon the securitization of Medalist Partners Corporate Finance CLO VI in February 2020, the Company received $13.7 million in cash from the CLO VI warehouse and recognized a gain of $1.0 million.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions using a two-step process: (i) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that each tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position; and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nInvestment Banking\nOther Income\n\nUnder a Revolving Note and Cash Subordination Agreement (as amended, the Revolving Note Agreement\u201d) and related Revolving Note (as amended, the Revolving Note\u201d), each dated April 8, 2011, JMP Securities holds a $20.0 million revolving line of credit with CNB to be used for regulatory capital purposes in connection with its securities underwriting activities. Advances under the Revolving Note Agreement bear interest at CNB's announced prime interest rate. The unused portion of the line bears interest at the rate of 0.25% per annum, paid monthly.\nA specific reserve is provided for loans that are considered impaired. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We measure impairment of a loan based upon either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, if the loan is collateral-dependent, depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy.\nAdministration\nRecent Developments\nPrior to the sale of the majority equity interest in JMPCA, the asset management fees for the CLOs under management during the period consisted only of senior and subordinated base management fees. We recognized base management fees for the CLOs on a monthly basis over the period during which the collateral management services are performed. The base management fees for the CLOs were calculated as a percentage of the average aggregate collateral balances for a specified period. As we consolidated the CLOs, the management fees earned at JMPCA from the CLOs were eliminated on consolidation in accordance with GAAP. For the period from January 1, 2019 through January 17, 2019 (deconsolidation date), the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO III were 0.35% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the period from January 1, 2019 through March 19, 2019 (deconsolidation date) , the contractual base and subordinated fees earned from CLO IV were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the period from January 1, 2019 through March 19, 2019 (deconsolidation date), the contractual base and subordinated fees earned from CLO V were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the period from January 1, 2019 through March 19, 2019 (deconsolidation date), the contractual base and subordinated fees earned from CLO VI warehouse portfolio were 1.0% of the average equity contributions.\n\nOperating Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the Company's GAAP net income as follows:\nThe following summarized financial information presents the information of JMP Group LLC, JMP Investment Holdings LLC and JMP Group Inc. on a combined basis and eliminates intercompany balances. It does not include or present investments in subsidiaries that are not an issuer or guarantor. One of the non-guarantor subsidiaries not combined, JMP Securities, is subject to certain regulations, which require the maintenance of minimum net capital. This requirement may limit the issuer's access to this subsidiary's assets.\nInterest income primarily consists of interest income earned on loans collateralizing ABS issued (through March 2019), investments in CLO debt securities, and loans held for investment. Interest income on loans is comprised of the stated coupon as a percentage of the face amount receivable as well as accretion of purchase discounts and deferred fees. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis, in accordance with the terms of the respective loans, unless such loans are placed on non-accrual status. Interest on CLO debt securities are recognized in interest income using the effective yield method.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the loan covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nTravel and Business Development\n \u2022 equity research coverage of three target industries; \nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n (v) reverses net unrealized gains and losses on strategic equity investments and certain warrant positions; \nIn the section that follows, we discuss the significant changes in the components of our balance sheet, cash flows, and capital resources and liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2020 to demonstrate where our capital is invested and the financial condition of the Company.\nCompensation and benefits, which includes employee payroll, taxes and benefits, performance-based cash bonus and commissions, as well as equity-based compensation to our employees and managing directors, increased $17.8 million, or 23.1%, from $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $95.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn January 17, 2019, the non-call period of JMP Credit Advisors CLO III(R) Ltd. ( CLO III\u201d) expired, which resulted in a change in the entity with the control over the most significant activities of the variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d). The expiration of the non-call period resulted in the Company losing control over the most significant activities of CLO III. The Company deconsolidated CLO III as of January 17, 2019. The Company continues to hold approximately 47% of the outstanding junior subordinated notes of CLO III and the Company accounts for its ownership of the CLO III subordinated notes as an investment in a CLO debt security. The Company recognized a gain of $1.6 million as revenue from principal transactions on the deconsolidation of CLO III for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 asset management products and services to institutional investors, high net-worth individuals and for our own account; and \nThe Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by all of the Company's other wholly owned subsidiaries (other than JMP Securities and certain dormant subsidiaries) and are secured by substantially all of its and the guarantors' assets. In addition, we have entered into a limited recourse pledge agreement with CNB whereby JMP Group LLC granted a lien on the equity interests in JMP Investment Holdings LLC and JMPAM to secure the Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement. In July 2020, the Company earned into a Seventh Amendment to its Credit Facility with CNB, that among other things, requires the Company maintain a minimum of $6.0 million of CLO debt securities, based on their fair value as of June 30, 2020 pledged as collateral supporting the obligations under the Credit Agreement. See Note 9, Loans, for more information on the Seventh Amendment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our material indebtedness consisted of our then outstanding Senior Notes and borrowing on our revolving line of credit with City National Bank ( CNB\u201d) under the Credit Agreement described below.\nA summary of the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, and for comparable prior periods, is set forth below.\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We regard an accounting estimate or assumption to be most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations where:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nBrokerage, clearing, and exchange fees include the cost of floor and electronic brokerage and execution, securities clearance, and exchange fees. Changes in brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees fluctuate largely in line with the volume of our sales and trading activity.\nOn December 23, 2020, HCC and Portman Ridge Finance Corporation ( PTMN\u201d) announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which HCC will merge with and into PTMN, a business development company managed by Sierra Crest Investment Management LLC ( Sierra Crest\u201d), an affiliate of BC Partners Advisors L.P. The parties currently expect the transaction to be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2021. The Company's partially-owned subsidiary HCAP Advisors provides investment advisory services to HCC. In addition, the Company had investments in HCC common stock of $7.5 million as of December 31, 2020. In connection with the above transaction, HCC stockholders will receive aggregate consideration equal to HCC's net asset value at closing. This consideration will be funded using PTMN shares (valued at 100% of PTMN's net asset value per share at the time of closing of the transaction) and, to the extent the required number of PTMN shares exceeds 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of PTMN common stock immediately prior to the transaction closing, cash consideration in the amount of such excess. As described below, HCAP stockholders will have an opportunity, subject to certain limitations, to elect to receive either cash or PTMN shares in consideration for their HCAP shares. Additionally, all HCAP stockholders will receive an additional cash payment from Sierra Crest of $2.15 million in the aggregate, or approximately $0.36 per share.\nCompensation and Benefits\nFees reported as asset management fees were $8.3 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, asset management revenues decreased from 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 7.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Fees reported as other income were $3.7 million and $2.4 million for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, other income were 3.2% and 2.4% for both of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDepreciation\nManagement uses Operating Net Income as a key, non-GAAP metric when evaluating the performance of JMP Group LLC's core business strategy and ongoing operations, as management believes that this metric appropriately illustrates the operating results of JMP Group LLC's core operations and business activities. Operating Net Income is derived from our segment reported results and is the measure of segment profitability on an after-tax basis used by management to evaluate our performance. This non-GAAP measure is presented to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance. Additionally, management believes that Operating Net Income is a useful measure because it allows for a better evaluation of the performance of JMP Group LLC's ongoing business and facilitates a meaningful comparison of the Company's results in a given period to those in prior and future periods.\nOther JMP Group LLC considerations\nNon-controlling interest represents the pro rata share of the income or loss partially-owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements.\nBrokerage, Clearing and Exchange Fees\nWe had total restricted cash of $1.2 million comprised primarily of restricted cash at JMP Group Inc. related to the Company's letters of credit on leasing arrangements.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli by the U.S. government spurred a sharp recovery in U.S. equity prices directly. The U.S. equities market continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second half of 2020. The Company's equity capital markets and brokerage revenues directly benefited from the improved capital market condition.\nOn an operating basis, as a percentage of total adjusted net revenues, principal transaction revenues decreased from 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net liquid assets of $108.0 million consisting of cash and cash equivalents, receivable from clearing broker, marketable securities owned, investment banking fee receivable, net of marketable securities sold but not yet purchased and accrued compensation. We have satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of the Senior Notes, draws on a line of credit and internally generated cash from operations. Most of our financial instruments, other than certain marketable securities, are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value.\nExpenses\n \u2022 the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and \nOther operating expenses primarily include occupancy, depreciation, and administration expense.\nThe following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.\nThe Company measures fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures with respect to fair value measurements. The accounting principles related to fair value measurement apply to all financial instruments that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis. This includes those items currently reported in marketable securities owned, at fair value, other investments and marketable securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nBrokerage Revenues\nUnfunded commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower, provided that all conditions have been met. The Company had no material unfunded commitments to lend at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nPrincipal Transactions\n*Operating Net Income (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure. See the section titled Operating Net Income (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) for more information about this non-GAAP measure, including a reconciliation to net income (loss).\n (ii) recognizes 100% of the cost of deferred compensation in the period for which such compensation was awarded, instead of recognizing such cost over the vesting period as required under GAAP, in order to match compensation expense with the actual period upon which the compensation was based; \nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, certain costs declined in 2020 as the underlying activities are restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel and related expenses. In addition, after a careful review of our cost structure, we reduced headcount modestly during the quarter ended September 30, 2020. While the headcount reduction resulted in recognition of severance costs, the reduced ongoing cost should increase cash flows in the future periods. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our liquidity in future periods still remains uncertain.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\nOccupancy\nThe timing of bonus compensation payments to our employees may significantly affect our cash position and liquidity from period to period. While our employees and managing directors are generally paid semi-monthly during the year, bonus compensation, which makes up a larger portion of total compensation, is generally paid once a year during the first two months of the following year. In the first two months of 2020, we paid out $26.9 million of cash bonuses for 2019, including employer payroll tax expense.", "item_7_tables": "Table 157: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in

section:\n\nOverview\n- JMP Group is a diversified capital markets firm providing investment banking, sales and trading, and asset management services. 2020 was impacted by COVID-19 which caused uncertainty but also some benefits like lower travel costs.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Total revenues were $115.5 million in 2020 vs $100.1 million in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by a 52.8% increase in investment banking revenues. However, principal transactions revenue decreased due to impairment losses on CLO investments.\n\n- Expenses increased due to higher compensation costs, partially offset by lower travel, administration, and other costs.\n\n- Pre-tax loss narrowed from $13.4 million to $8.1 million. Net loss also improved from $6.6 million to $4.8 million. \n\nFinancial Condition\n- Cash flows improved significantly in 2020 due to operating and investing activities. Cash increased by $41.8 million during 2020.\n\n- Material debt remains the Senior Notes and borrowing on a revolving line of credit. Compliant with loan covenants.\n\n- Liquidity is sufficient to meet needs for next 12 months based on historical performance and current strategy.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Key policies relate to fair value measurements, allowance for loan losses, income taxes, equity-based compensation. These involve significant judgment.\n\nThat covers the key points from the MD&A. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"}
