Risk Factors.\u201d\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nOur Bank is a member-owned cooperative serving shareholder members in our district. Our mission is to be a reliable provider of funding, liquidity, and services for our members so that they can meet the housing, business, and economic development needs of the communities they serve. Our operating model balances the trade-off between attractively priced products, reasonable returns on capital stock, maintaining an adequate level of capital to meet regulatory capital requirements, and maintaining adequate retained earnings to preserve the par value of member-owned capital stock. Our members include commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, insurance companies, and CDFIs.\nFinancial Results\nIn 2020, we reported net income of $362 million compared to $384 million in 2019. Our net income, calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was driven by net interest income, other income (loss), and other expense.\nNet interest income totaled $472 million in 2020 compared to $576 million in 2019. Our net interest margin was 0.45 percent during 2020 compared to 0.42 percent during 2019. The $104 million decline in net interest income was primarily impacted by the lower interest rate environment and lower average advance balances, partially offset by an increase in advance prepayment fee income of $66 million compared to the same period in 2019.\nDuring 2020, we recorded other income (loss) of $121 million compared to $20 million in 2019. Other income (loss) was primarily impacted by net gains on litigation settlements of $120 million in 2020 as a result of settlements with defendants in our private-label MBS litigation. We did not record any litigation settlements during 2019. Other factors impacting other income (loss) included net gains (losses) on trading securities and net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.\nOther expense totaled $189 million for 2020 compared to $168 million for 2019. The increase in other expense was primarily due to increased pension costs as a result of us making a discretionary contribution of $32 million at the end of the year, offset in part by lower professional fees and other operating expenses.\nOur total assets decreased to $87.7 billion at December 31, 2020, from $129.6 billion at December 31, 2019 driven by a decrease in advances and investments. Advances at December 31, 2020 decreased by $33.8 billion from advances at December 31, 2019 due primarily to a decrease in borrowings of $25.5 billion by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. We experienced decreased demand for advances across the majority of our other institution types, driven primarily by increased liquidity in the financial markets and higher member deposit levels. Investments decreased $7.0 billion from December 31, 2019 due primarily to a decline in money market investments of $9.7 billion, as liquidity management was impacted by lower advance demand and other economic impacts of COVID-19.\nOur total liabilities decreased to $82.0 billion at December 31, 2020, from $122.9 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in the amount of consolidated obligations needed to fund our assets.\nTotal capital decreased to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020 from $6.7 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in capital stock resulting from a decline in member activity. Our regulatory capital ratio increased to 6.55 percent at December 31, 2020, from 5.31 percent at December 31, 2019, and was above the required regulatory minimum at each period end. Regulatory capital includes all capital stock, mandatorily redeemable capital stock, and retained earnings.\nAdjusted Earnings\nAs part of evaluating our financial performance, we adjust GAAP net interest income and GAAP net income before assessments for the impact of (i) market adjustments relating to derivative and hedging activities and instruments held at fair value, (ii) realized gains (losses) on investment securities, and (iii) other non-routine and unpredictable items, including, but not limited to, net asset prepayment fee income, mandatorily redeemable capital stock interest expense, discretionary pension contributions, and net gains on litigation settlements. The resulting non-GAAP measure, referred to as our adjusted earnings, reflects both adjusted net interest income and adjusted net income.\nBecause our business model is primarily one of holding assets and liabilities to maturity, management believes that the adjusted earnings measure is helpful in understanding our operating results and provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison of our economic performance in contrast to GAAP results, which can be impacted by fair value changes driven by market volatility on financial instruments recorded at fair value or transactions that are considered to be unpredictable or not routine. As a result, management uses the adjusted earnings measure to assess performance under our incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. While these non-GAAP measures can be used to assist in understanding the components of our earnings, they should not be considered a substitute for results reported under GAAP.\nThe adjusted net income methodology is calculated on a post Affordable Housing Program (AHP) assessment basis. Management believes AHP assessments are a fundamental component of our business and believes this assessment should be included in our adjusted net income calculation. In addition, this treatment aligns the adjusted net income results to our strategic business plan, which is calculated on a post AHP assessment basis.\nAs indicated in the tables that follow, our adjusted net interest income and adjusted net income decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019. The decline was driven by lower adjusted net interest income due primarily to lower average advance balances and the lower interest rate environment.\nThe following table summarizes the reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted net interest income (dollars in millions):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exclude: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepayment fees on advances, net1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepayment fees on investments, net2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily redeemable capital stock interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market value adjustments on fair value hedges3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjustments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Include items reclassified from other income (loss): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest expense on economic hedges </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net interest margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Prepayment fees on advances, net includes basis adjustment amortization and premium and/or discount amortization.\n2 Prepayment fees on investments, net includes basis adjustment amortization and premium and/or discount amortization.\n3 Represents,gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items in qualifying hedging relationships.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations.\u201d\nCOVID-19\nThe effects of COVID-19 and the response to the virus continue to impact financial markets and overall economic conditions. In keeping with our mission to be a reliable provider of liquidity in all economic environments, we remain dedicated to meeting the needs of members through these challenging and unusual times. We have implemented certain relief measures to help members serve customers affected by COVID-19, such as accommodating forbearance and modifications to pledged loan collateral, allowing electronic signatures on loan documentation in specific circumstances, and adding payment deferment as another viable post-forbearance repayment option for participating financial institution (PFI) servicers to assist impacted borrowers.\nWe also temporarily expanded our Community Investment Advance (CIA) product and allowed Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) eligible members to demonstrate CIA program qualifications using PPP loans. This temporary expansion expired on December 31, 2020. In addition, we have made collateral policy changes and clarifications including accepting PPP loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as eligible collateral.\nWe remain focused on both the health and safety of our employees. The majority of our employees continue to work remotely, with a limited number of employees voluntarily working from our headquarters. We have not experienced and do not expect to experience any impairment of our ability to meet the needs of members.\nThe effects of COVID-19 are rapidly evolving, and the full impact and duration of the virus are unknown. As a result of measures taken to address the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown, interest rates have declined significantly and our financial statements have been adversely impacted. Further, demand for advances decreased significantly as a number of emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve helped facilitate liquidity and support stability in the fixed-income markets and as members experienced substantial deposit growth. The extent of the impact to our future performance will depend upon how long the current conditions persist. For additional information, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Conditions in the Financial Markets - Economy and Financial Markets\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nReplacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate\nIn July 2017, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021 it will no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee to identify a set of alternative reference interest rates for possible use as market benchmarks. This committee proposed SOFR as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in the second quarter of 2018. SOFR is based on a broad segment of the overnight Treasury repurchase market and is intended to be a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.\nOn September 27, 2019, the Finance Agency issued a Supervisory Letter to all FHLBanks providing LIBOR transition guidance. The Supervisory Letter stated that by March 31, 2020, the FHLBanks should no longer enter into new financial assets, liabilities, and derivatives that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021 for all product types other than investments. For investments, the Supervisory Letter indicated the FHLBanks, by December 31, 2019, should stop purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021. We ceased purchasing investments that reference LIBOR in 2018. As a result of market volatility triggered in part by COVID-19, on March 16, 2020, the Finance Agency extended from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020 the FHLBanks' ability to enter into new instruments referencing LIBOR that mature after December 31, 2021. As of June 30, 2020, we ceased execution of new LIBOR indexed transactions with maturities beyond December 31, 2021.\nOn November 30, 2020, U.S. and UK regulators and LIBOR's administrator made a series of announcements regarding the end of LIBOR. Collectively, these announcements proposed a prolonged wind-down for use of LIBOR. They call for no new LIBOR contracts after the end of 2021, while giving legacy contracts sufficient time to wind-down. If adopted, these proposed plans would cease the major LIBOR tenors in mid-2023 (overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month), and two less used LIBOR settings at the end of 2021 (1 week, 2-month).\nAs noted throughout this report, many of our advances, investments, consolidated obligation bonds, derivatives, and related collateral are indexed to LIBOR. Some of these assets and liabilities and related collateral have maturity dates that extend beyond 2021. We are preparing for a transition away from LIBOR and plan to utilize SOFR as the dominant replacement rate on an ongoing basis. We have developed a transition plan that will change with market developments and member needs and addresses considerations such as LIBOR exposure, member products, fallback language, operational preparedness, and balance sheet management.\nIn assessing our current exposure to LIBOR, we have developed an inventory of financial instruments impacted and identified contracts that may require adding or adjusting the fallback language. We have added or adjusted fallback language to our advance agreements with members and added fallback language to our consolidated obligation agreements. We continue to monitor the market-wide efforts to address fallback language related to derivatives and investment securities as well as fallback language for new activities and issuances of financial instruments. We are in the process of ensuring we are operationally ready, including updating our processes and information technology systems to support the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.\nMarket activity in SOFR-indexed financial instruments continues to increase and we continue to offer SOFR-indexed advances and issue SOFR-indexed debt. In 2020, we also began utilizing interest rate swaps based on the federal funds or SOFR OIS rates as an alternative to using LIBOR when entering into new derivative transactions.\nFor additional information on regulatory action related to LIBOR, including our adherence to fallback protocol for certain derivative agreements, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legislative and Regulatory Developments.\u201d\nThe following tables summarize our variable rate advances,

the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nCONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS\nEconomy and Financial Markets\nThe COVID-19 outbreak continues to cause tremendous human and economic hardship across the U.S. Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of 2020. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\nThe path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In its December 16, 2020 statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee) stated that it decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to 0.25 percent. The Committee stated that it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to two percent and is on track to moderately exceed two percent for some time. The Committee stated that the assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures, inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\nAs the spread of COVID-19 increased and the economic impact continued to be negative, the Federal Reserve and Congress implemented a multitude of programs to help stabilize market conditions. The Federal Reserve indicated that it will continue to increase its holdings of U.S. Treasuries and agency MBS, until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.\nMortgage Markets\nBeginning in March 2020, the impact of COVID-19 significantly affected the U.S. housing markets and resulted in declines in interest rates, home inventory, and home sales. In the second half of 2020, the housing market began to show signs of recovery. Home sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 to levels above the fourth quarter of 2019 and housing inventory remained low, resulting in higher home prices. During 2020, mortgage rates continued to decline, on average, and refinancing activity remained the primary driver of mortgage activity.\nThe federal government programs to assist homeowners affected by the pandemic, including temporary mortgage payment forbearance and a temporary moratorium on foreclosures and evictions, remained in place during the fourth quarter of 2020. Forbearances and delinquencies of mortgage loans stabilized and began to trend down in the second half of 2020, consistent with a decline in the rate of unemployment. The federal government programs are set to expire on June 30, 2021, which could result in an increase in delinquencies and foreclosures.\nInterest Rates\nThe following table shows information on key market interest rates1:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fourth Quarter 2020\n3-Month\nAverage </td> <td> </td> <td>Fourth Quarter 2019\n3-Month\nAverage </td> <td> </td> <td>2020\n12-Month\nAverage </td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n12-Month\nAverage </td> <td> </td> <td>2020\nEnding Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>2019\nEnding Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal funds </td> <td>0.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.55 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three-month LIBOR </td> <td>0.22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.91 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SOFR </td> <td>0.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2-year U.S. Treasury </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.97 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10-year U.S. Treasury </td> <td>0.86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30-year residential mortgage note </td> <td>2.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.70 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.74 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Source: Bloomberg.\nIn March 2020, the FOMC lowered the Federal Reserve's key target interest rate, the federal funds rate, to a range of zero to 0.25 percent and maintained that range throughout 2020, compared to a range of 1.50 to 1.75 percent for 2019.\nThe U.S. Treasury yields have declined to historically low levels and mortgage rates were lower on average during 2020 when compared to 2019. The global concerns related to COVID-19 and the impact on economic activity have led to lower interest rates.

During 2020, our short-term funding spreads to LIBOR, on average, were generally more favorable when compared to 2019. As such, we utilized short-term discount notes in an effort to capture attractive funding, match the repricing structures on floating rate assets, and meet our liquidity requirements. During 2020, our long-term funding spreads to LIBOR, on average, generally deteriorated when compared to 2019. Our funding spreads were mixed relative to U.S. Treasuries when compared to the same periods in the prior year.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Income\nThe following table presents comparative highlights of our net income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions).

balances are calculated on a daily weighted average basis and do not reflect the effect of derivative master netting arrangements with counterparties and/or clearing agents.\n2 Interest income and expense amounts reported for advances, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), other investments, and consolidated obligation bonds include gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships.\n3 The average balance of AFS securities is reflected at amortized cost; therefore the resulting yields do not give effect to changes in fair value.\n4 Average balances reflect the impact of fair value hedging adjustments.\n5 Other investments primarily include U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, taxable municipal bonds, and Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO) bonds.\n6 Non-accrual loans are included in the average balance used to determine the average yield.\n7 Other interest-bearing liabilities consists of mandatorily redeemable capital stock and borrowings from other FHLBanks.\n8 Represents yield on total interest-earning assets minus cost of total interest-bearing liabilities.\n9 Represents net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.\nThe following table presents changes in interest income and interest expense. Changes in interest income and interest expense that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but rather equally attributable to both volume and rate changes, are allocated to the volume and rate categories based on the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes (dollars in millions).\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

INTEREST SPREAD\nNet interest spread equals the yield on total interest-earning assets minus the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. During 2020, our net interest spread was 0.38 percent compared to 0.29 percent and 0.32 percent for the same periods in 2019 and 2018. Our net interest spread during 2020 was primarily impacted by increased advance prepayment fee income of $66 million compared to the same period in 2019. The primary components of our interest income and interest expense are discussed below.\nNET INTEREST MARGIN\nNet interest margin equals net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. During 2020, our net interest margin was 0.45 percent compared to 0.42 percent and 0.43 percent for the same periods in 2019 and 2018. The increase in net interest margin during 2020 when compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to higher asset-liability spreads, offset in part by the lower interest rate environment.\nAdvances\nInterest income on advances decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019, due primarily to the lower interest rate environment and lower average advance balances, partially offset by an increase in advance prepayment fee income. The decrease in average advance balances from prior year was primarily a result of a decline in advances from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and decreased demand for advances across the majority of other institution types, driven primarily by increased liquidity in the financial markets and higher member deposit levels. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in borrowings by non-captive insurance companies. We do not expect significant new advances to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in the near future and this trend of paydowns and decreased new borrowings by members may continue. Interest income on advances increased during 2019 when compared to 2018, due primarily to the higher interest rate environment on average, partially offset by lower average advance balances as a result of a decline in advances from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and captive insurance company members.\nInvestments\nInterest income on investments decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019 due primarily to the lower interest rate environment. Interest income on investments increased during 2019 when compared to 2018 due primarily to higher average money market investment balances as a result of increased liquidity needs resulting from advance demand during 2019 and the higher interest rate environment on average. This increase was partially offset by lower average MBS and other investment balances.\nBonds\nInterest expense on bonds decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019 due primarily to the lower interest rate environment and lower average bond balances, largely driven by a decrease in the amount of consolidated obligations needed to fund our assets. In addition, during 2020, we increased our usage of shorter-term discount notes relative to bonds in an effort to capture attractive funding, match the repricing structures on floating rate assets, and meet our liquidity requirements. Interest expense on bonds increased during 2019 when compared to 2018 due primarily to the higher interest rate environment on average, offset in part by lower average bond balances driven by a reduction in total assets.\nDiscount Notes\nInterest expense on discount notes decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to the lower interest rate environment and lower average discount note balances driven by a decrease in the amount of consolidated obligations needed to fund our assets. Interest expense on discount notes increased during 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily due to the to the higher interest rate environment on average, partially offset by lower average discount note balances driven by a reduction in total assets.\nOther Income (Loss)\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (loss) (dollars in millions):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses) on trading securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on litigation settlements, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2020, we recorded other income (loss) of $121 million compared to $20 million during 2019. Other income (loss) was primarily impacted by net gains on litigation settlements of $120 million as a result of settlements with defendants in our private-label MBS litigation. As of December 31, 2020, all private-label litigation cases initially filed have been settled. We did not record any litigation settlements during 2019. Other factors impacting other income (loss) included net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities and net gains (losses) on trading securities, as described below.\nDuring 2020, we recorded net losses of $48 million on our derivatives and hedging activities compared to net losses of $35 million in 2019. The fair value changes were primarily driven by changes in interest rates which impacted the fair value of interest rate swaps used to economically hedge our investment securities portfolio. These changes were primarily driven by market volatility caused by COVID-19 and the impact it had on interest rates. Accounting rules require all derivatives to be recorded at fair value and therefore we may be subject to income statement volatility. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Hedging Activities\u201d for additional discussion on our derivatives and hedging activities.\nDuring 2020, we recorded net gains on trading securities of $17 million compared to net gains of $28 million in 2019. These changes in fair value were primarily due to the impact of changes in interest rates and credit spreads on our fixed rate trading securities which stemmed from market volatility caused by COVID-19. Trading securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected through other income (loss).\nHedging Activities\nWe use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Accounting rules affect the timing and recognition of income and expense on derivatives and therefore we may be subject to income statement volatility.\nIf a hedging activity qualifies for hedge accounting treatment (fair value hedge), the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables related to the derivative are recognized as interest income or expense in the relevant income statement caption consistent with the hedged asset or liability. The net fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items designated in fair value hedge relationships are also recognized as interest income or expense. Amortization of basis adjustments from terminated hedges and the amortization of the financing element of off-market derivatives are also recorded in interest income or expense.\nIf a hedging activity does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (economic hedge), the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables related to the derivative as well as the fair value gains and losses on the derivative are recorded as a component of other income (loss) in Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities;\u201d however, there is no fair value adjustment for the corresponding asset or liability being hedged unless changes in the fair value of the asset or liability are normally marked to fair value through earnings (i.e., trading securities and fair value option instruments).\nThe following table categorizes the net effect of hedging activities on net income by product (dollars in millions):\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Effect of Hedging Activities </td> <td> </td> <td>Advances </td> <td> </td> <td>Investments </td> <td> </td> <td>Mortgage\nLoans </td> <td> </td> <td>Bonds </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net amortization/accretion1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(44) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(72) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest settlements on derivatives3\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(146) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(132) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total impact to net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>(184) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(110) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(187) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (loss): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses) on economic hedges4\n</td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses) on trading securities5\n</td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total impact to other income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net effect of hedging activities6\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(184) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(139) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(218) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Represents the amortization/accretion of basis adjustments on closed hedge relationships.\n2 Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items in qualifying fair value hedge relationships are reported in net interest income.

As a result, this line item may not agree to the Statements of Income.\n6 The hedging activity tables do not include the interest component on the related hedged items or the gross prepayment fee income on terminated advance or investment hedge relationships.\nNET AMORTIZATION/ACCRETION\nAmortization/accretion varies from period to period depending on our hedge relationship termination activities and the maturity, call, or prepayment of assets or liabilities previously in hedge relationships. During 2020, we experienced increased amortization activity, primarily due to an increase in prepayments of advances and investments that were previously in a hedge relationship.\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES AND HEDGED ITEMS\nThe net gains and losses on derivatives and hedged items are recorded in net interest income. Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items are primarily driven by changes in the benchmark interest rate, volatility, and the divergence in the valuation curves used to value our assets, liabilities, and derivatives. During 2020, we recorded gains of $17 million on our fair value hedge relationships compared to gains of $9 million in 2019, which stemmed from market volatility caused by COVID-19 and the impact it had on interest rates.\nNET INTEREST SETTLEMENTS\nNet interest settlements represent the interest component on derivatives. These amounts vary from period to period depending on our hedging activities and interest rates and are partially offset by the interest component on the related hedged item within net interest income. The hedging activity tables do not include the impact of the interest component on the related hedged item.\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON ECONOMIC HEDGES\nWe utilize economic derivatives to manage certain risks on our Statements of Condition. Gains and losses on economic derivatives are driven by changes in interest rates and volatility and include interest settlements. Interest settlements represent the interest component on economic derivatives. These amounts vary from period to period depending on our hedging activities and interest rates. During 2020, we recorded net losses of $48 million on our economic derivatives. The fair value changes were primarily driven by changes in interest rates which impacted the fair value of interest rate swaps used to economically hedge our investment securities portfolio as highlighted in the table below. These changes were primarily driven by market volatility caused by COVID-19 and the impact it had on interest rates.\nInvestments\nGains and losses on our trading securities are also due primarily to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. The following table summarizes gains and losses on these economic derivatives as well as the related trading securities (dollars in millions):\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on interest rate swaps economically hedging our investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(32) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(34) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest settlements </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses) on investment derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses) on related trading securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses) on economic investment hedge relationships </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Expense\nThe following table shows the components of other expense (dollars in millions):\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual services </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal Housing Finance Agency </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office of Finance </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expense increased $21 million during 2020 when compared to 2019, driven primarily by an increase in compensation and benefits. The increase in compensation and benefits was primarily due to increased pension costs as a result of us making a discretionary contribution of $32 million at the end of the year. We did not make a discretionary pension contribution in 2019. This increase was offset in part by a decline in other operating expenses and professional fees. Other operating expenses decreased due to lower depreciation expense on core system projects and fewer employee travel costs in light of COVID-19. Professional fees declined as a result of fewer external resources to assist with our technology and operational initiatives during the year.\nSTATEMENTS OF CONDITION\nFinancial Highlights\nOur total assets decreased to $87.7 billion at December 31, 2020, from $129.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Our total liabilities decreased to $82.0 billion at December 31, 2020, from $122.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Total capital decreased to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020, from $6.7 billion at December 31, 2019.

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings of $25.5 billion by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as they paid off their remaining advance balances during 2020. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. had our largest concentration of advances outstanding at December 31, 2019. We do not expect significant new advances to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in the near future and this trend of paydowns and decreased new borrowings by members may continue. In 2020, we experienced decreased demand for advances across the majority of our other institution types, driven primarily by increased liquidity in the financial markets and higher member deposit levels.\nAs a result of the final rule on membership issued by the Finance Agency effective February 19, 2016, the eligibility requirements for FHLBank members were changed, rendering captive insurance company members ineligible for FHLBank membership. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members prior to September 12, 2014, had their memberships terminated February 19, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, while we had five captive insurance company members, none had advances outstanding.\nThe following table summarizes our advances by product type (dollars in millions):\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate </td> <td>31,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortizing </td> <td>1,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par value </td> <td>46,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discounts </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value hedging adjustments </td> <td>427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total advances </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value hedging adjustments changed $271 million at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019 due to the impact of interest rates on our cumulative fair value adjustments on advances in hedge relationships.\nINTEREST RATE PAYMENT TERMS\nThe following table summarizes advances by interest rate payment and redemption terms (dollars in millions):\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due in one year or less </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,422 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after one year </td> <td>22,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,739 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fixed rate </td> <td>33,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,161 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due in one year or less </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after one year </td> <td>11,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total variable rate </td> <td>12,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,024 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par value </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, 25 and 31 percent of our advances were variable rate callable advances. Callable advances may be prepaid by borrowers on pertinent dates (call dates) and therefore provide borrowers a source of long-term financing with prepayment flexibility. Interest rates on our variable rate callable advances reset at each call date to be consistent with either the underlying index or our current offering rate in line with our underlying cost of funds. We generally fund our variable rate callable advances with either discount notes or short-term floating rate debt. For additional discussion on our funding strategies, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity - Sources of Liquidity.\u201d\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, advances outstanding to our five largest member borrowers totaled $15.5 billion and $39.3 billion, representing 34 percent and 49 percent of our total advances outstanding.

In December 2020, we declared a member bank in default under its contractual terms and individually assessed the related advances for expected credit losses as of December 31, 2020, concluding no allowance for credit losses was necessary in light of the advances being well-secured with underlying collateral. All other advances were evaluated on a collective basis as of December 31, 2020 and, based upon our collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on advances, we determined there were no expected credit losses on those advances.\nWe consider an advance past due for financial reporting purposes if a default of contractual principal or interest exists for a period of 30 days or more. In light of the above event, as of February 28, 2021, we have advances outstanding with a par value of $365 million that are considered past due.

The decrease was primarily due to principal paydowns exceeding loan purchases as a result of increased refinancing activity driven by lower rates.\nWe evaluate mortgage loans for credit losses on a quarterly basis. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, our allowance for credit losses totaled $1 million. For additional discussion on our mortgage loan credit risk, refer to Item 7.

At December 31, 2020, our ratio of MBS to regulatory capital was 2.40 compared to 2.12 at December 31, 2019.\nWe evaluate investments for credit losses on a quarterly basis.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Credit Risk - Investments.\u201d\nConsolidated Obligations\nConsolidated obligations, which include bonds and discount notes, are the primary source of funds to support our advances, mortgage loans, and investments. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of consolidated obligations for which we are primarily liable totaled $79.6 billion and $121.1 billion.\nDISCOUNT NOTES\nThe following table summarizes our discount notes, all of which are due within one year (dollars in millions):\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Par value </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,592 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discounts and concession fees1\n</td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,531 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Concessions represent fees paid to dealers in connection with the issuance of certain consolidated obligation discount notes.\nOur discount notes decreased $2.2 billion or seven percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019.

The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in total assets. In addition, we increased our usage of shorter-term discount notes relative to bonds in an effort to capture attractive funding, match the repricing structures on floating rate assets, and meet our liquidity requirements. Fair value hedging adjustments changed $150 million at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019, due to the impact of interest rates on our cumulative fair value adjustments on bonds in hedge relationships.\nINTEREST RATE PAYMENT TERMS\nBonds are issued with fixed or variable rate payment terms that use a variety of indices for interest rate resets such as SOFR or LIBOR. With respect to interest payments, fixed rate bonds may also have the following terms:\n\u2022Step-Up Bonds. These bonds pay interest at increasing fixed rates for specified intervals over the life of the bond. These bonds generally contain provisions enabling us to call the bonds at our option on the step-up dates.\n\u2022Step-Down Bonds. These bonds pay interest at decreasing fixed rates for specified intervals over the life of the bond. These bonds generally contain provisions enabling us to call the bonds at our option on the step-down dates.\nThe following table summarizes our bonds by interest rate payment terms (dollars in millions):\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simple variable rate </td> <td>12,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,937 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Step-up </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par value </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,373 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information on our consolidated obligations, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity - Sources of Liquidity.\u201d\nMandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock\nWe reclassify capital stock subject to redemption from equity to a liability (mandatorily redeemable capital stock) at the time shares meet the definition of a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument. This occurs after a member provides written notice of redemption, gives notice of intention to withdraw from membership, becomes ineligible for continuing membership, or attains non-member status by merger or consolidation, charter termination, or other involuntary termination from membership.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our mandatorily redeemable capital stock totaled $52 million and $206 million. Our total mandatorily redeemable capital stock balance decreased $154 million at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019 due primarily to the repurchase of capital stock outstanding to captive insurance company members during 2020, driven by repayment of their advance balances.\nCapital\nThe following table summarizes information on our capital (dollars in millions):\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital stock </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,517 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retained earnings </td> <td>2,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,165 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,726 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital decreased $1.0 billion or 15 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in capital stock resulting from a decline in member activity. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital\u201d for additional information on our capital.\nDerivatives\nWe use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. The notional amount of derivatives serves as a factor in determining periodic interest payments and cash flows received and paid. However, the notional amount of derivatives represents neither the actual amounts exchanged nor our overall exposure to credit and market risk.\nThe following table categorizes the notional amount of our derivatives by type (dollars in millions):\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate swaps </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncallable </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callable by counterparty </td> <td>1,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callable by the Bank </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest rate swaps </td> <td>35,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,722 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Forward settlement agreements (TBAs) </td> <td>169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loan purchase commitments </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total notional amount </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,971 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe notional amount of our derivative contracts decreased at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by advance prepayments and a reduction in overall assets and liabilities. Consistent with the move to an alternative benchmark rate other than LIBOR, we started using interest rate swaps based on the federal funds or SOFR OIS rates to hedge our balance sheet during 2020. For additional discussion regarding our use of derivatives, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Derivatives.\u201d\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital positions are actively managed in an effort to preserve stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds to meet current and projected future operating financial commitments, as well as regulatory, liquidity, and capital requirements.\nLiquidity\nSOURCES OF LIQUIDITY\nWe utilize several sources of liquidity to carry out our business activities. These include, but are not limited to, proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations, payments collected on advances and mortgage loans, proceeds from investment securities, member deposits, the issuance of capital stock, and current period earnings.\nOur primary source of liquidity is proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations (bonds and discount notes) in the capital markets. During 2020, proceeds from the issuance of bonds and discount notes were $42.5 billion and $178.9 billion compared to $66.7 billion and $121.2 billion in 2019. We continued to focus on issuing shorter-term discount notes in an effort to capture attractive funding, match repricing structures on advances, and provide additional liquidity.\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak developed during 2020, the capital markets became more volatile. Despite the increased market volatility, we were operationally prepared, maintained continual access to funding, and issued debt to meet the needs of our members. Access to debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preference and our government affiliation, have sought the FHLBanks' debt as an asset of choice. However, due to the short-term maturity of the debt, we may be exposed to additional risks associated with refinancing and our ability to access the capital markets.\nWe are focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between our financial assets and financial liabilities and work collectively with the other FHLBanks to manage the system-wide liquidity and funding needs. We monitor our debt refinancing risk and liquidity position primarily by tracking the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, we consider contractual maturities of our financial assets and liabilities, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments). External factors, including member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may affect liquidity balances and the funding balances between financial assets and financial liabilities. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements\u201d for additional information regarding the contractual maturities or redemption terms of certain of our financial assets and liabilities.\nOur ability to raise funds in the capital markets as well as our cost of borrowing may be affected by our credit ratings. As of February 28, 2021, our consolidated obligations were rated AA+/A-1+ by Standard and Poor's and Aaa/P-1 by Moody's and both ratings had a stable outlook. In August 2020, Fitch Ratings affirmed the long-term U.S. sovereign AAA rating, but revised the outlook to negative\u201d from stable.\u201d Following this action, Fitch Ratings also affirmed our long-term AAA rating and revised the outlook to negative\u201d from stable.\u201d At February 28, 2021, our consolidated obligations remained rated AAA with a negative outlook by Fitch Ratings. For further discussion of how credit rating changes and our ability to access the capital markets may impact us in the future, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nAlthough we are primarily liable for the portion of consolidated obligations that are issued on our behalf, we are also jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all consolidated obligations issued by the FHLBank System. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations for which we are primarily liable was $79.3 billion and $121.0 billion. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations issued on behalf of other FHLBanks for which we are jointly and severally liable was $667.5 billion and $904.9 billion.\nThe Office of Finance and FHLBanks have contingency plans in place that prioritize the allocation of proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations during periods of financial distress if consolidated obligations cannot be issued in sufficient amounts to satisfy all FHLBank demand. In the event of significant market disruptions or local disasters, our President or designee is authorized to establish interim borrowing relationships with other FHLBanks. To provide further access to funding, the FHLBank Act also authorizes the U.S. Treasury to directly purchase new issue consolidated obligations of the GSEs, including FHLBanks, up to an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. As of February 28, 2021, no purchases had been made by the U.S. Treasury under this authorization.\nUSES OF LIQUIDITY\nWe use our available liquidity, including proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations, primarily to repay consolidated obligations, fund advances, and purchase investments. During 2020, repayments of consolidated obligations totaled $263.0 billion compared to $203.7 billion in 2019. A portion of these payments were due to the call of certain bonds in an effort to better match our projected asset cash flows. During 2020, we called bonds with a total par value of $2.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 2019.\nDuring 2020, advance disbursements totaled $146.8 billion compared to $264.6 billion in 2019. Advance disbursements will vary from period to period depending on member needs. During 2020, investment purchases (excluding overnight investments) totaled $19.6 billion compared to $147.2 billion in 2019. Investment purchases during each period were primarily driven by the purchase of money market investments, including secured resale agreements, or U.S. Treasury securities in an effort to manage our liquidity position.\nWe also use liquidity to purchase mortgage loans, redeem member deposits, pledge collateral to derivative counterparties, redeem or repurchase capital stock, pay expenses, and pay dividends.\nLIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS\nWe are subject to certain liquidity requirements set forth by the Finance Agency, as further outlined below. We also maintain a liquidity contingency funding plan designed to enable us to meet our obligations and the liquidity needs of our members in the event of short-term capital market disruptions, or operational disruptions at our Bank and/or the Office of Finance.\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank Liquidity (the Liquidity Guidance AB) - This guidance requires us to maintain sufficient liquidity for a period of 10 to 30 calendar days. The base case scenario requires 20 days of positive daily cash balances and assumes that we cannot access the capital markets to issue debt, and during that time we will automatically renew maturing and called advances for all members, including very large highly-rated members, and we hold additional liquid assets equal to one percent of our letters of credit balances. As a result of the deterioration in financial market conditions due to COVID-19, the Finance Agency issued revised guidance in March 2020 lowering the base case liquidity requirements during the year. However, the required calendar days of positive daily cash balances returned to 20 days by December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with this base case liquidity guidance.\nThis Liquidity Guidance AB also specifies appropriate funding gap limits to address the risks associated with a FHLBank having too large a mismatch between the contractual maturities of its assets and liabilities. A funding gap measures the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period and is expressed as a percentage of total assets. The guidance provides funding gap limits within the range of negative 10 percent to negative 20 percent for a three-month horizon and negative 25 percent to negative 35 percent for a one-year horizon. Initial guidance, which was in effect at December 31, 2019, was set at a trailing three-month average of negative 15 percent for the three-month horizon and a trailing three-month average of negative 30 percent for the one-year horizon. In addition to the relief provided for base case liquidity noted above, on March 12, 2020, the Finance Agency also increased the funding gap ratios for the three-month and one-year time horizons during the year. The recommended funding gap maximums were reduced to negative 20 percent at the three-month horizon and negative 35 percent at the one-year horizon by December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we adhered to these funding gap requirements.\nLiquidity Reserves for Deposits - We are required to have available at all times an amount greater than or equal to members' current deposits invested in advances with maturities not to exceed five years, deposits in banks or trust companies, and obligations of the U.S. Treasury. The following table shows our compliance with this requirement (dollars in billions):\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity deposit reserves </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess liquidity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnpledged Qualifying Assets - We are required to maintain, in the aggregate, unpledged qualifying assets in an amount at least equal to the amount of our participation in total consolidated obligations outstanding. The following table shows our compliance with this requirement (dollars in billions):\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Qualifying assets free of lien or pledge </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated obligations outstanding </td> <td>79.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess liquidity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital\nCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nWe are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. First, the FHLBank Act requires that we maintain at all times permanent capital greater than or equal to the sum of our credit, market, and operations risk capital requirements, all calculated in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. Only permanent capital, defined as Class B capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock), and retained earnings can satisfy this risk-based capital requirement. Second, the FHLBank Act requires a minimum four percent capital-to-asset ratio, which is defined as total regulatory capital divided by total assets. Total regulatory capital includes all Class B capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) and retained earnings. It does not include accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). Third, the FHLBank Act imposes a five percent minimum leverage ratio, which is defined as the sum of permanent capital weighted 1.5 times and nonpermanent capital weighted 1.0 times, divided by total assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not hold any nonpermanent capital. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with all three of the Finance Agency's regulatory capital requirements.\nIn addition to the requirements previously discussed, during 2019, the Finance Agency finalized an Advisory Bulletin on capital stock (the Capital Stock AB) which required each FHLBank to maintain at all times a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets, effective February 2020. For purposes of the Capital Stock AB, capital stock includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The capital stock to total assets ratio is measured on a daily average basis at month end. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the Capital Stock AB. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Capital\u201d for additional information on our capital requirements.\nCAPITAL STOCK\nOur capital stock has a par value of $100 per share, and all shares are issued, redeemed, and repurchased only at the stated par value. We generally issue a single class of capital stock (Class B stock) and have two subclasses of Class B capital stock: membership and activity-based. Each member must purchase and hold membership capital stock in an amount equal to 0.12 percent of its total assets as of the preceding December 31st, subject to a cap of $10 million and a floor of $10,000. Each member is also required to purchase activity-based capital stock equal to 4.00 percent of its advances and mortgage loans outstanding. Effective October 1, 2020, we required each member to purchase and hold activity-based stock in an amount equal to 0.10 percent of its standby letters of credit. This requirement applies to any new, renewed or modified standby letters of credit issued on or after October 1, 2020. All Class B capital stock issued is subject to a notice of redemption period of five years.\nThe capital stock requirements established in our Capital Plan are designed so that we can remain adequately capitalized as member activity changes. Our Board of Directors may make adjustments to the capital stock requirements within ranges established in our Capital Plan.\nBecause membership is voluntary, a member can provide a notice of withdrawal from membership at any time. If a member provides a notice of withdrawal from membership, we will not repurchase or redeem any membership stock until five years from the date of receipt of a notice of withdrawal. To the extent membership is terminated involuntarily, we may elect to repurchase that institution's membership stock prior to the end of the five-year redemption period. If a member withdraws or is involuntarily terminated from membership and holds activity-based capital stock, we will repurchase any such stock that is not required to support remaining business activity with the institution.\nA member may cancel any pending notice of redemption before the completion of the five-year redemption period by providing a written notice of cancellation. We charge a cancellation fee equal to a percentage of the par value of the shares of capital stock subject to redemption. This fee is currently set at a range of one to five percent depending on when we receive notice of cancellation from the member. Our Board of Directors retains the right to change the cancellation fee at any time. We will provide at least 15 days' written notice to each member of any adjustment or amendment to our cancellation fee.\nWe cannot repurchase or redeem any membership or activity-based capital stock if the repurchase or redemption would cause a member to be out of compliance with its required investment. In addition, there are statutory and regulatory restrictions on our obligation or right to redeem outstanding capital stock.\nFirst, in no case may we redeem any capital stock if, following such redemption, we would fail to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital requirements. By law, all member holdings of our capital stock immediately become nonredeemable if we become undercapitalized.\nSecond, we are precluded by regulation from redeeming any capital stock without the prior approval of the Finance Agency if either our Board of Directors or the Finance Agency determines that we incurred or are likely to incur losses resulting in or likely to result in a charge against capital.\nThird, we cannot redeem shares of capital stock from any member if the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation of the FHLBank System is not paid in full when due, or under certain circumstances if (i) we project, at any time, that we will fail to comply with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements, or will be unable to timely and fully meet all of our current obligations, (ii) we actually fail to comply with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements or to timely and fully meet all of our current obligations, or enter or negotiate to enter into an agreement with one or more other FHLBanks to obtain financial assistance to meet our current obligations, or (iii) the Finance Agency determines that we will cease to be in compliance with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements, or will lack the capacity to timely or fully meet all of our current obligations.\nIf we are liquidated, after payment in full to our creditors, our stockholders will be entitled to receive the par value of their capital stock as well as any retained earnings, in an amount proportional to the stockholder's share of the total shares of capital stock. In the event of a merger or consolidation, our Board of Directors shall determine the rights and preferences of our stockholders, subject to applicable Finance Agency regulations, as well as any terms and conditions imposed by the Finance Agency.\nRegulatory Capital Stock\nThe following table summarizes our regulatory capital stock by type of member (dollars in millions):\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial banks </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,767 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings institutions </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit unions </td> <td>514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>547 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance companies </td> <td>1,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,089 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CDFIs </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total GAAP capital stock </td> <td>3,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,517 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily redeemable capital stock </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total regulatory capital stock </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,723 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in regulatory capital stock held at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to a decline in member activity. For additional information on our capital stock, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Capital.\u201d\nRETAINED EARNINGS\nOur risk management policies include a target level of retained earnings based on the amount we believe necessary to help protect the redemption value of capital stock, facilitate safe and sound operations, maintain regulatory capital ratios, and support our ability to pay a relatively stable dividend. We monitor our achievement of this target and may utilize tools such as restructuring our balance sheet, generating additional income, reducing our risk exposures, increasing capital stock requirements, or reducing our dividends to achieve our targeted level of retained earnings. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our actual retained earnings exceeded our retained earnings target.\nUnder the JCE Agreement, we are required to allocate 20 percent of our quarterly net income to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the balance of that account, calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter, equals at least one percent of our average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the calendar quarter. The restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately on our Statements of Condition. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our restricted retained earnings account totaled $576 million and $504 million. One percent of our average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was $810 million.\nDuring 2020, we also received a partial recovery of a prior capital distribution from the Financing Corporation in the amount of approximately $26 million, which was credited to unrestricted retained earnings. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Capital.\u201d\nDIVIDENDS\nOur Board of Directors may declare and pay different dividends for each subclass of capital stock. Dividend payments may be made in the form of cash and/or additional shares of capital stock. Historically, we have only paid cash dividends. By regulation, we may only pay dividends from current earnings or unrestricted retained earnings. We are prohibited from paying a dividend in the form of additional shares of capital stock if, after the issuance, the outstanding excess capital stock would be greater than one percent of our total assets. Our Board of Directors may not declare or pay dividends if it would result in our non-compliance with regulatory capital requirements.\nOur current philosophy is to pay a membership capital stock dividend similar to a reference rate of interest, such as SOFR, and an activity-based capital stock dividend, when possible, at a level above the membership capital stock dividend. Prior to the second quarter of 2020 dividend, we used average three-month LIBOR as our reference rate. Beginning with the second quarter dividend, paid in the third quarter of 2020, we used SOFR as our reference rate.\nOur dividend rates seek to strike a balance between providing reasonable and consistent returns to members while preserving our financial position, flexibility, and ability to serve as a long-term liquidity provider. Our actual dividend is determined quarterly by our Board of Directors, based on policies, regulatory requirements, actual performance, and other considerations that the Board determines to be appropriate.\nThe following table summarizes dividend-related information (dollars in millions):\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate cash dividends paid1\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective combined annualized dividend rate paid on capital stock2\n</td> <td>4.86 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized dividend rate paid on membership capital stock </td> <td>3.06 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized dividend rate paid on activity-based capital stock </td> <td>5.56 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average three-month LIBOR </td> <td>0.64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average SOFR </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Includes aggregate cash dividends paid during the period. Amount excludes cash dividends paid on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. For financial reporting purposes, these dividends were recorded as interest expense on our Statements of Income.\n2 Effective combined annualized dividend rate is paid on total capital stock, including mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments and assumptions that affect our reported results and disclosures. Certain of our accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others to our financial results. Given the assumptions and judgment used, we have identified fair value measurements and derivatives and hedging activities as critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. While management believes our estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on historical experience and other factors, actual results could differ from those estimates and differences could be material to the financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe record trading securities, AFS securities, derivative assets and liabilities, and certain other assets at fair value on our Statements of Condition on a recurring basis and on occasion, certain impaired mortgage loans held for portfolio on a non-recurring basis. Fair value is a market-based measurement and is defined as the price received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. In general, the transaction price will equal the exit price and, therefore, represent the fair value of the asset or liability at initial recognition. In determining whether a transaction price represents the fair value of the asset or liability at initial recognition, we are required to consider factors specific to the asset or liability, the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, and market participants with whom we would transact in that market.\nFair values play an important role in our valuation of certain assets, liabilities, and hedging transactions. Fair value is first determined based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, where available. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, fair values are determined based on external or internal pricing models that use (i) discounted cash flows using market estimates of interest rates and volatility, (ii) dealer prices, or (iii) prices of similar instruments.\nFor prices obtained externally, we have control processes in place to ensure fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. These processes include but are not limited to; challenging a price when it falls out of our tolerance parameters and identifying a stale price, significantly changed price, or other anomalies that may indicate that a price may not be accurate. In addition, on an annual basis, we conduct reviews of our pricing vendors to confirm and further augment our understanding of the vendors' pricing processes, methodologies, and control procedures for investment securities. For internal pricing models, the underlying assumptions are based on management's best estimates for discount rates, prepayments, market volatility, and other factors. The assumptions used in both external and internal pricing models could have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including the related income and expense. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in materially different values.\nWe categorize our financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level hierarchy. The hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs used to value the asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not carry any financial assets or liabilities, measured on a recurring basis, at fair value on our Statements of Condition based on unobservable inputs.\nRefer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 - Fair Value\u201d for additional discussion on our fair value measurements.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nAll derivatives are recognized on the Statements of Condition at their fair values and reported as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities, net of cash collateral and accrued interest received from or pledged to clearing agents and/or counterparties. The fair values of derivatives are netted by clearing agent and/or counterparty when the netting requirements have been met. If these netted amounts result in a receivable to the Bank, they are classified as a derivative asset and, if classified as a payable to the clearing agent or counterparty, they are classified as a derivative liability. Cash flows associated with derivatives are reflected as cash flows from operating activities on the Statements of Cash Flows unless the derivative meets the criteria to be a financing derivative.\nWe transact most of our derivative transactions with large banks and major broker-dealers. Over-the-counter derivative transactions may be either executed directly with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., a clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (cleared derivatives). We utilize one Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse), CME Clearing, for all cleared derivative transactions. CME Clearing notifies the clearing agent of the required initial margin and daily variation margin payments, and the clearing agent in turn notifies the Bank. The Clearinghouse determines initial margin requirements which are considered cash collateral. Variation margin requirements with CME Clearing are based on changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives and are legally characterized as daily settlement payments, which are a component of the derivative fair value, rather than cash collateral.\nOnce a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse), the derivative transaction is novated and the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse. The Bank is not a derivative dealer and does not trade derivatives for short-term profit.\nDerivative Designations. Derivative instruments are designated by the Bank as:\n\u2022a fair value hedge of an associated financial instrument or firm commitment (fair value hedge); or\n\u2022an economic hedge to manage certain defined risks on the Bank's Statements of Condition (economic hedge). These hedges are primarily used to: (i) manage mismatches between the coupon features of the Bank's assets and liabilities, (ii) offset prepayment risk in certain assets, (iii) mitigate the income statement volatility that occurs when financial instruments are recorded at fair value and hedge accounting is not permitted by accounting guidance, or (iv) to reduce exposure to reset risk.\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nIf hedging relationships meet certain criteria, including, but not limited to, formal documentation of the fair value hedging relationship and an expectation to be highly effective, they qualify for fair value hedge accounting. At the inception of each fair value hedge transaction, we formally document the hedge relationship and our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value attributable to the hedged risk will be assessed. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to assets and liabilities on the Statements of Condition and firm commitments.\nBeginning January 1, 2019, we adopted new hedge accounting guidance, which impacted the presentation of gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities for qualifying hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, any hedge ineffectiveness, or the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in fair value of the hedged item, was recorded in other income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d Two approaches to fair value hedge accounting include:\n\u2022Long-haul hedge accounting. The application of long-haul hedge accounting requires us to formally assess (both at the hedge's inception and at least quarterly) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items due to benchmark interest rate changes and whether those derivatives are expected to remain highly effective in future periods. The Bank uses regression analyses to assess the effectiveness of its long-haul hedges.\n\u2022Short-cut hedge accounting. Transactions that meet certain criteria qualify for short-cut hedge accounting in which an assumption can be made that the change in fair value of a hedged item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate exactly offsets the change in fair value of the related derivative. Under the short-cut method, the entire change in fair value of the interest rate swap is considered to be highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability. If documented at the time of hedge designation, a derivative relationship no longer qualifying for short-cut hedge accounting can fallback to the long-haul accounting method.\nDerivatives are typically executed at the same time as the hedged item, and we designate the hedged item in a fair value hedge relationship at the trade date. In many hedging relationships, we may designate the fair value hedging relationship upon our commitment to disburse an advance or trade a consolidated obligation in which settlement occurs within the shortest period of time possible for the type of instrument based on market settlement conventions. We then record the changes in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item beginning on the trade date.\nECONOMIC HEDGES\nAn economic hedge is defined as a derivative hedging specific or non-specific underlying assets, liabilities, or firm commitments that does not qualify or was not designated for fair value hedge accounting, but is an acceptable hedging strategy under our risk management program. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as economic hedges are recorded in other income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d with no offsetting fair value adjustments for the underlying assets, liabilities, or firm commitments, unless changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities are normally marked to fair value through earnings (e.g., trading securities and fair value option instruments).\nACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES\nThe net settlements of interest receivables and payables related to derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized as adjustments to the interest income or interest expense of the designated hedged item. The net settlements of interest receivables and payables related to derivatives designated as economic hedges are recognized in other income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d\nDISCONTINUANCE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING\nWe discontinue fair value hedge accounting prospectively when either (i) we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of a hedged item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate, (ii) the derivative and/or the hedged item expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or (iii) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.\nWhen fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, we either terminate the derivative or continue to carry the derivative on the Statements of Condition at its fair value. For any remaining hedged item, we cease to adjust the hedged item for changes in fair value and amortize the cumulative basis adjustment on the hedged item into earnings over the remaining contractual life of the hedged item using a level-yield methodology.\nEMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\nWe may issue debt, make advances, or purchase financial instruments in which a derivative instrument is embedded.\u201d Upon execution of these transactions, we assess whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the debt, advance, or purchased financial instrument (the host contract) and whether a separate, non-embedded instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. If we determine that the embedded derivative has economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract, carried at fair value, and designated as an economic derivative instrument. However, if we elect to carry the entire contract (the host contract and the embedded derivative) at fair value on the Statements of Condition, changes in fair value of the entire contract will be reported in current period earnings.\nRefer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities\u201d for additional discussion on our derivatives.\nLEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\nFinance Agency Final Rule on FHLBank Housing Goals Amendments\nOn June 25, 2020, the Finance Agency published a final rule, effective August 24, 2020, amending the FHLBank housing goals regulation. Enforcement of the final rule will phase in over three years. The final rule replaces the four existing retrospective housing goals with a single prospective mortgage purchase housing goal target in which 20 percent of Acquired Member Asset (AMA) mortgages purchased in a year must be comprised of loans to low-income or very low-income families, or to families in low-income areas. The final rule also establishes a separate small member participation housing goal with a target level in which 50 percent of the members selling acquired member asset (AMA) loans in a calendar year must be small members. The final rule provides that an FHLBank may request Finance Agency approval of alternative target levels for either or both of the goals. The final rule also establishes that housing goals apply to each FHLBank that acquires any AMA mortgages during a year, eliminating the existing $2.5 billion volume threshold that previously triggered the application of housing goals for each FHLBank.\nWe do not believe these changes will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFinance Agency Final Rule on Stress Testing\nOn March 24, 2020, the Finance Agency published a final rule, effective upon issuance, to amend its stress testing rule, consistent with section 401 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (EGRRCPA). The final rule (i) raises the minimum threshold for entities regulated by the Finance Agency to conduct periodic stress tests from $10 billion to $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, (ii) removes the requirements for FHLBanks to conduct stress testing, and (iii) removes the adverse scenario from the list of required scenarios. FHLBanks are currently excluded from this regulation because no FHLBank has total consolidated assets over $250 billion, but the Finance Agency reserved its discretion to require an FHLBank with total consolidated assets below the $250 billion threshold to conduct stress testing. These amendments align the Finance Agency's stress testing rule with rules adopted by other financial institution regulators that implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) stress testing requirements, as amended by EGRRCPA.\nThis rule eliminates these stress testing requirements for the Bank, unless the Finance Agency exercises its discretion to require stress testing in the future. We do not expect this rule to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nMargin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities\nOn July 1, 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Farm Credit Administration, and the Finance Agency (collectively, Prudential Banking Regulators) jointly published a final rule, effective August 31, 2020, amending regulations that established minimum margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps for covered swap entities under the jurisdiction of the Prudential Banking Regulators (Prudential Margin Rules). In addition to other changes, the final rule (i) allows swaps entered into by a covered swap entity prior to an applicable compliance date to retain their legacy status and not become subject to the Prudential Margin Rules in the event that the legacy swaps are amended to replace an interbank offered rate (such as LIBOR) or other discontinued rate, or due to other technical amendments, notional reductions or portfolio compression exercises, (ii) introduces a new Phase 6 compliance date for initial margin requirements for covered swap entities and their counterparties with an average daily aggregate notional amount (AANA) of uncleared swaps of at least $8 billion, and (iii) clarifies that initial margin (IM) trading documentation does not need to be executed prior to the parties becoming obligated to exchange IM.\nOn the same date, the Prudential Banking Regulators published an interim final rule, effective September 1, 2020, extending the IM compliance date for Phase 6 counterparties to September 1, 2022. On November 9, 2020, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) published a final rule extending the IM compliance date for Phase 6 counterparties to September 1, 2022, thereby aligning with the Prudential Banking Regulators.\nFurther, on January 5, 2021, the CFTC published a final rule, effective February 4, 2021, that primarily amends the minimum margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps under the jurisdiction of the CFTC (CFTC Margin Rules) by requiring covered entities to use a revised AANA calculation starting on September 1, 2022. The amendments, among other things, require entities subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction to calculate the AANA for uncleared swaps during March, April and May of the current year, based on an average of month-end dates, as opposed to the previous requirement which required the calculation of AANA during June, July and August of the prior year, based on daily calculations. Parties would continue to be expected to exchange IM based on the AANA totals as of September 1 of the current year. These amendments align with the recommendation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions. Separately, on January 25, 2021, the CFTC published a final rule, effective February 24, 2021, that amends the CFTC Margin Rules to permit, among other changes, covered swap entities to maintain separate minimum transfer amounts (MTA) for IM and variation margin for each swap counterparty, provided the combined MTA does not exceed $500,000.\nWe do not expect these rules to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFDIC Brokered Deposits Restrictions\nOn January 22, 2021, the FDIC published a final rule, effective April 1, 2021, that amends its brokered deposits regulations that apply to less than well-capitalized insured depository institutions. The FDIC stated that the amendments are intended to modernize and clarify the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations and they establish a new framework for analyzing the deposit broker definition, which determines whether deposits placed through deposit placement arrangements qualify as brokered deposits. These deposit placement arrangements include those between insured depository institutions and third parties, such as financial technology companies, for a variety of business purposes, including access to deposits. The amendments to the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations, among other things, clarify what it means to be engaged in the business of facilitating the placement of deposits and expand the scope of the primary purpose exception. The rule amendments are expected to have the effect of narrowing the definition of deposit broker and excluding more deposits from treatment as brokered deposits. The amendments also establish an application and reporting process with respect to the primary purpose exception for businesses that do not meet one of several bright-line tests, and they affirm the FDIC's position that the brokering of certificates of deposit constitutes deposit brokering.\nThis rule may have an effect on member demand for certain advances, but we cannot predict the extent of the impact. To the extent this rule has a material impact on our advance demand, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin 2020-01 Federal Home Loan Bank AMA Risk Management\nOn January 31, 2020, the Finance Agency released guidance on risk management of AMA. The guidance communicates the Finance Agency's expectations with respect to an FHLBank's funding of its members through the purchase of eligible mortgage loans and includes expectations that an FHLBank will have board-established limits on AMA portfolios and management-established thresholds to serve as monitoring tools to manage AMA-related risk exposure. The guidance provides that the board of an FHLBank should ensure that the bank serves as a liquidity source for members, and an FHLBank should ensure that its portfolio limits do not result in the FHLBank's acquisition of mortgages from smaller members being crowded out\u201d by the acquisition of mortgages from larger members. The advisory bulletin contains the expectation that the board of an FHLBank should set limits on the size and growth of portfolios and on acquisitions from a single participating financial institution. In addition, the guidance provides that the board of an FHLBank should consider concentration risk in the areas of geographic area, high-balance loans, and in third-party loan originations.\nWe do not expect this advisory bulletin to materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nUnited States Department of Treasury (Treasury) and Fannie Mae Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment\nOn January 14, 2021, Treasury and Fannie Mae entered into a letter agreement amending the terms of their Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (PSPA), which could impact PFIs that participate in the MPF Program's MPF Xtra product (where MPF loans acquired are concurrently sold to Fannie Mae). Under the PSPA, Treasury provides liquidity to Fannie Mae in exchange for senior preferred stock. Under the recent PSPA amendment, effective January 1, 2022, the Finance Agency (acting as conservator for Fannie Mae) and Treasury agreed to limit the dollar volume of loans Fannie Mae could purchase from a single seller through Fannie Mae's cash window to $1.5 billion per year. As administrator of the MPF Program, the FHLBank of Chicago purchases MPF Xtra loans from PFIs and sells them to Fannie Mae via the cash window process. Based on volumes for the MPF Xtra product program-wide in 2020, the PSPA amendment would significantly curtail MPF Xtra cash window sales. Although this would negatively impact the volume of loans sold through the MPF Program unless a solution is developed, we do not currently expect it to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nLIBOR Transition\nFINANCE AGENCY SUPERVISORY LETTER - PLANNING FOR LIBOR PHASE-OUT\nOn September 27, 2019, the Finance Agency issued a Supervisory Letter to the FHLBanks that the Finance Agency stated is designed to ensure the FHLBanks will be able to identify and prudently manage the risks associated with the termination of LIBOR in a safe and sound manner. The Supervisory Letter provided that the FHLBanks should, by March 31, 2020, cease entering into new LIBOR referenced financial assets, liabilities, and derivatives with maturities beyond December 31, 2021 for all product types except investments. With respect to investments, the FHLBanks were required, by December 31, 2019, to stop purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021. These phase-out dates did not apply to collateral accepted by the FHLBanks. The Supervisory Letter also directed the FHLBanks to update their pledged collateral certification reporting requirements by March 31, 2020, in an effort to encourage members to distinguish LIBOR-linked collateral maturing after December 31, 2021. The FHLBanks were expected to cease entering into LIBOR-indexed financial instruments maturing after December 31, 2021, by the deadlines specified in the Supervisory Letter, subject to limited exceptions granted by the Finance Agency for LIBOR-linked products serving compelling mission, risk mitigating, and/or hedging purposes that do not currently have readily available alternatives. We ceased purchasing investments that reference LIBOR in 2018.\nAs a result of the market volatility experienced during 2020 due in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Finance Agency extended the FHLBanks' authority to enter into LIBOR-based instruments that mature after December 31, 2021 from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020. In addition, the Finance Agency extended the requirement to update pledged collateral certification reporting requirements from March 31, 2020, to September 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, we ceased execution of new LIBOR indexed transactions with maturities beyond December 31, 2021.\nWe continue to evaluate the potential impact of the Supervisory Letter and the related subsequent guidance on our financial condition and results of operations, but we may experience decreased flexibility in our access to funding, higher funding costs, or lower overall demand or increased costs for our advances; which may, in turn, negatively impact our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLIBOR TRANSITION - ISDA 2020 IBOR FALLBACKS PROTOCOL AND SUPPLEMENT TO THE 2006 ISDA DEFINITIONS\nOn October 23, 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA), published a Supplement to the 2006 ISDA Definitions (Supplement) and the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (Protocol). Both the Supplement and the Protocol took effect on January 25, 2021. On that date, all legacy bilateral derivative transactions subject to Protocol-covered agreements (including ISDA agreements) that incorporate certain covered ISDA definitional booklets and reference a covered Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR), including LIBOR, were effectively amended to apply the new ISDA-recommended IBOR fallbacks in the event of the relevant IBOR's cessation. Both the Bank and our counterparty must have adhered to the Protocol in order to effectively amend legacy derivatives contracts, otherwise the parties must bilaterally amend legacy covered agreements (including ISDA agreements) to address LIBOR fallbacks. The Protocol will remain open for adherence after the effective date. As of January 25, 2021, all new derivative contracts are subject to the relevant IBOR fallbacks set forth in the Supplement.\nOn October 21, 2020, the Finance Agency issued a Supervisory Letter to the FHLBanks that required each FHLBank to adhere to the Protocol by December 31, 2020, and to the extent necessary, to amend any bilateral agreements regarding the adoption of the Protocol by December 15, 2020.\nWe adhered to the Protocol on October 22, 2020, and all of our counterparties have adhered to the Protocol. For a discussion of the potential impact of the LIBOR transition, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nFINANCE AGENCY SUPERVISORY LETTER - PPP LOANS AS COLLATERAL FOR FHLBANK ADVANCES\nOn April 23, 2020, the Finance Agency issued a Supervisory Letter (PPP Supervisory Letter) permitting the FHLBanks to accept PPP loans as collateral for advances as Agency Securities,\u201d given the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 100 percent guarantee of the unpaid principal balance. On April 20, 2020, the SBA published its third interim final rule related to PPP loans, which explicitly waived certain regulatory requirements that must be satisfied before a member could pledge PPP loans to the FHLBanks as collateral. The PPP Supervisory Letter establishes a series of conditions under which the FHLBanks may accept PPP loans as collateral, which conditions focus on the financial condition of members, collateral discounts, and pledge dollar limits.\nOn December 27, 2020, the President signed into law an extension of the PPP until March 31, 2021. The April 23, 2020 Supervisory Letter from the Finance Agency allowing FHLBanks to accept PPP loans as collateral remains in effect.\nCORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT (CARES ACT)\nThe CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The $2.2 trillion package was the largest stimulus bill in U.S. history. The CARES Act is in addition to previous relief legislation passed by Congress in March 2020. The legislation provides the following:\n\u2022Assistance to business, states, and municipalities;\n\u2022Creates a loan program for small businesses, non-profits and physician practices that can be forgiven through employee retention incentives;\n\u2022Provides the Treasury Secretary authority to make loans or loan guarantees to states, municipalities, and eligible businesses and loosens some regulations imposed through the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\u2022Direct payments to eligible taxpayers and their families;\n\u2022Expands eligibility for unemployment insurance and payment amounts; and\n\u2022Includes mortgage forbearance provisions and a foreclosure moratorium.\nFunding for the PPP, which was created by the CARES Act, was increased with the enactment of subsequent laws, most recently by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, on December 27, 2020. While some provisions of the CARES Act have expired, others have been extended by regulatory and legislative action. Additional phases of the CARES Act or other COVID-19 pandemic relief legislation may be enacted by Congress. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of such legislation on our business, including its continued impact to the U.S. economy, impacts to mortgages held or serviced by our members and that we accept as collateral, and the impacts on our MPF program.\nADDITIONAL COVID-19 PRESIDENTIAL, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden (and before him, President Trump), through executive orders, governmental agencies, including the SEC, OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, National Credit Union Administration, CFTC and the Finance Agency, as well as state governments and agencies, have taken, and may continue to take, actions to provide various forms of relief from, and guidance regarding, the financial, operational, credit, market, and other effects of the pandemic, some of which may have a direct or indirect impact on us or our members. Many of these actions are temporary in nature. We continue to monitor these actions and guidance as they evolve and to evaluate their potential impact on us.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nIn the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded on our Statements of Condition or may be recorded on our Statements of Condition in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transactions. For additional information on our off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table shows our contractual obligations due by payment period at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>< 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 to 3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>>3 to 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>>5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bonds1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,930 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily redeemable capital stock </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to purchase mortgage loans </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement contributions2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Excludes contractual interest payments related to bonds. Total is based on contractual maturities; the actual timing of payments could be impacted by factors affecting redemptions.\n2 Represents the future funding contribution for our qualified defined benefit multiemployer plan and the scheduled benefit payments for our nonqualified defined benefit plans.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nWe have risk management policies, established by our Board of Directors, that monitor and control our exposure to market, liquidity, credit, operational, model, information security, compliance, and strategic risk, as well as capital adequacy. Our primary risk management objective is to manage our assets and liabilities in ways that ensure liquidity is available to our members and protect the par redemption value of our capital stock. We periodically evaluate our risk management policies in order to respond to changes in our financial position and general market conditions.\nMarket Risk\nWe define market risk as the risk that changes in market prices may adversely affect our financial condition and performance. Interest rate risk is the principal type of market risk to which we are exposed as our cash flows, and therefore earnings and equity value, can change significantly as interest rates change. Our general approach toward managing interest rate risk is to acquire and maintain a portfolio of assets, liabilities, and derivatives, which taken together, limit our expected exposure to interest rate risk. Management regularly reviews our sensitivity to interest rate changes by monitoring our market risk measures in parallel and non-parallel interest rate changes and spread and volatility movements.\nOur key market risk measures are Market Value of Capital Stock (MVCS) Sensitivity and Projected Income Sensitivity.\nMARKET VALUE OF CAPITAL STOCK SENSITIVITY\nWe define MVCS as an estimate of the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities (excluding mandatorily redeemable capital stock) divided by the total shares of capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) outstanding. It represents an estimation of the liquidation value\u201d of one share of our capital stock if all assets and liabilities were liquidated at current market prices. MVCS does not represent our long-term value, as it takes into account short-term market price fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the long-term value of the cash flows from our assets and liabilities.\nThe MVCS calculation uses market prices which are computed using interest rates, which allows for negative rates beginning September 30, 2020, spreads, and volatilities, and assumes a run-off balance sheet. The timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are calculated by an internal model. To ensure the accuracy of the MVCS calculation, we reconcile the computed market prices of complex instruments, such as derivatives and mortgage assets, to market observed prices or dealers' quotes.\nInterest rate risk stress tests of MVCS involve instantaneous parallel and non-parallel changes in interest rates. The resulting percentage change in MVCS from the base case value is an indication of longer-term repricing risk and option risk embedded in the balance sheet.\nIn an effort to protect the MVCS from large interest rate swings, we manage the interest rate risk of our balance sheet by using hedging transactions, such as issuing consolidated obligation bonds, including floating rate, simple bullet, callable, or other structured features and entering into or canceling interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and swaptions.\nWe monitor and manage to the MVCS policy limits in an effort to ensure the stability of the Bank's value. Our policy limits are based on declines from the base case in parallel and non-parallel interest rate change scenarios. Any policy limit breach requires a prompt action to address the measure outside of the policy limit and the breach must be reported to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Bank and the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. We were in compliance with the MVCS policy limits at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOur down 200 basis point policy limit is suspended when the 10-year swap rate is below 2.50 percent and remains so for five consecutive days. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the 10-year swap rate had been below 2.50 percent for five consecutive days, and therefore the associated policy limit was suspended.\nThe following tables show our policy limits and base case and change from base case MVCS in dollars per share and percent change respectively, based on outstanding shares of capital stock, including shares classified as

was $171.0 at December 31, 2020 compared to $147.2 at December 31, 2019. The change was primarily attributable to the following factors:\n\u2022Decreased shares of capital stock: Our capital stock balance decreased at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019 due primarily to a decrease in member activity. As we repurchased this capital stock at par, which is below our current MVCS value, our MVCS was positively impacted.\n\u2022Increase in retained earnings: We recorded net income of $362 million during 2020, which included net gains on litigation settlements in the amount of $120 million. Dividend payments for 2020 totaled $203 million. The earnings in excess of dividend payments had a positive impact on the market value of our assets, thereby increasing MVCS.\nPROJECTED INCOME SENSITIVITY\nProjected income sensitivity is measured as the change in spread between projected 24-month return on average capital stock (ROACS) and an average projected reference rate. Effective July 1, 2020, we utilize average projected SOFR as our reference rate. Prior to July 1, 2020, we utilized average projected three-month LIBOR as our reference rate.\nWe monitor and manage projected 24-month income sensitivity in an effort to limit the short-term earnings volatility of the Bank. The projected 24-month income sensitivity is based on forward interest rates, which allows for negative rates beginning September 30, 2020, business, and risk management assumptions.\nOur policy limits are based on 24-month projected ROACS spread to the average projected reference rate declines from base spread for the up and down 100 and 200 basis points parallel interest rate change scenarios as well as the up and down 100 basis points non-parallel interest rate change scenarios. Additionally, there is a limit on the decline from base ROACS for certain basis shock scenarios to limit basis risk exposure. Any policy limit breach requires a prompt action to address the measure outside of the policy limit.\nWe were in compliance with the projected 24-month income sensitivity policy limits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe following table shows our 24-month projected ROACS spread to the average projected reference rate and associated policy limits, assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in

interest rate swaps in fair value hedge relationships for forward starting advance firm commitments of $252 million and $522 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAdvances\nWe offer a wide range of fixed and variable rate advance products with different maturities, interest rates, payment characteristics, and optionality. We may use derivatives to adjust the repricing and/or option characteristics of advances in an effort to manage interest rate risk. For example, we may hedge a fixed rate advance with an interest rate swap where we pay a fixed rate coupon and receive a variable rate coupon, effectively converting the fixed rate advance to a variable rate advance. This type of hedge is typically treated as a fair value hedge. In addition, we may hedge a callable advance, which gives the borrower the option to extinguish the fixed rate advance prior to maturity, by entering into a cancelable interest rate swap.\nWe may hedge a firm commitment for a forward-starting advance through the use of an interest-rate swap (fair value hedge). In this case, the interest rate swap functions as the hedging instrument for both the firm commitment and the subsequent advance. We may also enter into economic derivatives in an effort to mitigate the income statement volatility that occurs when an advance or firm commitment for a forward-starting advance is recorded under the fair value option and hedge accounting is not permitted.\nInvestments\nWe primarily invest in U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, and MBS, and classify them as either trading, AFS, or HTM. The interest rate and prepayment risk associated with these investment securities is managed through a combination of debt issuance and derivatives. We may fund investment securities with fixed rate long-term and callable consolidated obligations or utilize interest rate swaps, caps, floors, or swaptions to manage interest rate risk.\nThe prepayment options embedded in MBS can result in extensions or contractions in the expected maturities of these investments, depending on changes in and levels of interest rates, as well as other factors related to the mortgage market. The Finance Agency limits this source of interest rate risk by restricting the types of MBS we may own to those with limited average life changes under certain interest rate shock scenarios.\nMortgage Loans\nWe invest in fixed rate mortgage loans and certain mortgage loan purchase commitments with our PFIs that are considered derivatives. We normally hedge these commitments by selling TBA MBS for forward settlement. A TBA represents a forward contract for the sale of MBS at a future agreed upon date for an established price. Upon expiration of the mortgage loan purchase commitment, we purchase the TBA to close the hedged position.\nConsolidated Obligations\nWe may enter into derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our consolidated obligations. For example, we may issue and hedge a fixed rate consolidated obligation with an interest rate swap where we receive a fixed rate coupon and pay a variable rate coupon, effectively converting the fixed rate consolidated obligation to a variable rate consolidated obligation. This type of hedge is typically treated as a fair value hedge. We may also issue variable interest rate consolidated obligations and simultaneously execute interest rate swaps to hedge the basis risk of the variable interest rate debt. Interest rate swaps used to hedge variable interest rate debt do not qualify for hedge accounting and as a result, this type of hedge is treated as an economic hedge.\nThis strategy of issuing consolidated obligations while simultaneously entering into derivatives enables us to offer a wider range of attractively priced advances to our borrowers and may allow us to reduce our funding costs. While consolidated obligations are the joint and several obligations of the FHLBanks, each FHLBank serves as sole counterparty to derivative agreements associated with specific debt issues for which it is the primary obligor.\nWe may also enter into economic derivatives in an effort to mitigate the income statement volatility that occurs when consolidated obligations are recorded under the fair value option and hedge accounting is not permitted.\nBalance Sheet\nWe may enter into certain economic derivatives as macro balance sheet hedges to protect against changes in interest rates, including prepayments on mortgage assets. These economic derivatives may include interest rate caps, floors, swaps, and swaptions.\nOffsetting Positions\nAs a result of the merger with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (Merger), we acquired certain offsetting interest rate swaps and classified these as economic derivatives.\nCapital Adequacy\nAn adequate capital position is necessary for providing safe and sound operations of the Bank. Our key capital adequacy measures are MVCS and regulatory capital in order to maintain capital levels in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. In addition, we maintain a targeted level of retained earnings to protect the redemption value of capital stock, facilitate safe and sound operations, maintain regulatory capital ratios, and support our ability to pay a relatively stable dividend.\nFor a discussion of our key capital adequacy measure, MVCS, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Market Risk - Market Value of Capital Stock Sensitivity.\u201d\nFor additional information on our compliance with regulatory capital requirements as well as our targeted retained earnings, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nLiquidity Risk\nWe define liquidity risk as the risk that we will be unable to meet our financial obligations as they come due or meet the credit needs of our members in a timely and cost efficient manner. To manage this risk, we maintain liquidity in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. For additional information on compliance with these requirements, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity - Liquidity Requirements.\u201d\nCredit Risk\nWe define credit risk as the potential that our borrowers or counterparties will fail to meet their obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Our primary credit risks arise from our ongoing lending, investing, and hedging activities. Our overall objective in managing credit risk is to operate a sound credit granting process and to maintain appropriate credit administration, measurement, and monitoring practices.\nADVANCES\nWe manage our credit exposure to advances through an approach that provides for an established credit limit for each borrower, ongoing reviews of each borrower's financial condition, and detailed collateral and lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers' needs for a reliable source of funding. In addition, we lend to our borrowers in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and other applicable laws.\nWe are required by regulation to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure our advances, standby letters of credit, and other extensions of credit to borrowers (collectively, credit products). The estimated value of the collateral required to secure each borrower's credit products is calculated by applying collateral discounts, or haircuts, to the unpaid principal or market value, as applicable, of the collateral. We also have policies and procedures for validating the reasonableness of our collateral valuations. In addition, we perform collateral verifications and on-site reviews based on the risk profile of the borrower. Management believes that these policies effectively manage our credit risk from advances.\nEligible collateral includes:\n\u2022fully disbursed whole first mortgages on improved residential real property or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages;\n\u2022loans and securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof, including MBS issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae;\n\u2022 cash deposited with us; and\n\u2022other real estate-related collateral acceptable to us, such as second lien mortgages, home equity lines of credit, tax-exempt municipal securities, and commercial real estate mortgages, provided such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and we can perfect a security interest in it.\nCFIs may also pledge collateral consisting of secured small business, small agri-business, or small farm loans. As additional security, the FHLBank Act provides that we have a lien on each borrower's capital stock investment; however, capital stock cannot be pledged as collateral to secure credit exposures.\nBorrowers may pledge collateral to us by executing a blanket pledge agreement, specifically assigning collateral, or placing physical possession of collateral with us or our custodians. We perfect our security interest in all pledged collateral by filing Uniform Commercial Code financing statements or by taking possession or control of the collateral. Under the FHLBank Act, any security interest granted to us by our members, or any affiliates of our members, has priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor), unless those claims and rights would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual purchasers or by parties that have perfected security interests.\nUnder a blanket pledge agreement, we are granted a security interest in all financial assets of the borrower to fully secure the borrower's obligation. Other than securities and cash deposits, we do not initially take delivery of collateral from blanket agreement borrowers. In the event of a default or a deterioration in the financial condition of a blanket pledge agreement borrower, we have the ability to require delivery of pledged collateral sufficient to secure the borrower's obligation. With respect to non-blanket pledge agreement borrowers that are federally insured, we generally require collateral to be specifically assigned. With respect to non-blanket pledge agreement borrowers that are not federally insured (typically insurance companies, CDFIs, and housing associates), we generally take control of collateral through the delivery of cash, securities, or loans to us or our custodians.\nAlthough management has policies and procedures in place to manage credit risk, we may be exposed to this risk if our outstanding advance value exceeds the liquidation value of our collateral. We mitigate this risk by applying collateral discounts or haircuts to the unpaid principal balance or market value, as applicable, of the collateral to determine the advance equivalent value of the collateral securing each borrower's obligation. The amount of these discounts will vary based on the type of collateral and security agreement. We determine these discounts or haircuts using data based upon historical price changes, discounted cash flow analyses, and loan level modeling.\nAs a result of recent stressed market conditions stemming from COVID-19, we are taking additional steps to monitor our credit risk on advances. These steps include increased frequency of collateral valuation and identifying, analyzing, and monitoring borrowers with higher risk profiles.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, borrowers pledged $280.5 billion and $329.4 billion of collateral (net of applicable discounts) to support activity with us, including advances. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of our advances met the requirement to be collateralized at a minimum of 100 percent, net of applicable discounts. Borrowers pledge collateral in excess of their collateral requirement mainly to demonstrate available liquidity and to borrow additional amounts in the future.\nThe following table shows the Bank's total exposure, including advances, as well as the collateralization percentage of outstanding exposures by borrower type (dollars in millions):\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

We adopted new accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2020. We have never experienced a credit loss on our advances. Based upon our collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on advances, management has determined that there were no expected credit losses on our advances as of December 31, 2020. For the same reasons, we did not record any allowance for credit losses for our advances at December 31, 2019. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 - Advances\u201d for additional information.\nMORTGAGE LOANS\nWe are exposed to credit risk through our participation in the MPF program and the MPP. Mortgage loan credit risk is the risk that we will not receive timely payments of principal and interest due from mortgage borrowers because of borrower defaults. Credit risk on mortgage loans is affected by a number of factors, including loan type, borrower's credit history, and other factors such as home price fluctuations, unemployment levels, and other economic factors in the local market or nationwide.\nAs a result of recent deteriorating market and economic conditions stemming from COVID-19, we may be subject to increased credit risk on our mortgage loan portfolio. To assist homeowners affected by the current economic conditions, we have implemented several programs, including temporary mortgage payment forbearance and a temporary moratorium on foreclosures and evictions. The extent to which these programs will impact our mortgage portfolio and results of operations\nwill depend on the number of homeowners who partake in these programs in the months to come. In the second quarter of 2020, we also elected to apply the troubled debt restructuring (TDR) relief provided by the CARES Act on our conventional mortgage loan portfolio. For additional information on the CARES Act and activity, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio.\u201d\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loan portfolio by product type (dollars in millions):\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Type </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,712 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td>481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>496 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total mortgage loan unpaid principal balance </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe manage the credit risk on mortgage loans by (i) adhering to our underwriting standards, (ii) using agreements to establish credit risk sharing responsibilities with our PFIs, and (iii) monitoring the performance of the mortgage loan portfolio and creditworthiness of PFIs.\nWe evaluate mortgage loans for credit losses on a quarterly basis and establish an allowance for credit losses to reflect management's estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio. We adopted new accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2020.\nConventional Mortgage Loans. We determine our allowance for credit losses on conventional loans through analyses that include consideration of various loan portfolio and collateral-related characteristics, such as past performance, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected economic conditions. Conventional mortgage loans are evaluated collectively when similar risk characteristics exists. Conventional loans that do not share risk characteristics with other pools are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis. In limited instances, we may incorporate a management adjustment in the allowance for credit losses for conventional mortgage loans due to changes in economic and business conditions or other factors that may not be fully captured in our model. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the allowance for credit losses on our conventional loans was $1 million.\nGovernment-Insured Mortgage Loans. We invest in government-insured fixed rate mortgage loans that are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and/or the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture. The servicer or PFI obtains and maintains insurance or a guaranty from the applicable government agency. The servicer or PFI is responsible for compliance with all government agency requirements and for obtaining the benefit of the applicable guarantee or insurance with respect to defaulted government-insured mortgage loans. Any losses incurred on these loans that are not recovered from the insurer/guarantor are absorbed by the servicers. As such, we only have credit risk for these loans if the servicer or PFI fails to pay for losses not covered by the guarantee or insurance.\nWe have never experienced a credit loss on our government-insured mortgage loans. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we determined no allowance for credit losses was necessary on our government-insured mortgage loans.\nRefer to Item 8.

Our primary credit risk on investments is the counterparties' ability to meet repayment terms. We mitigate this credit risk by purchasing investment quality securities. We define investment quality as a security with adequate financial backings so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security. We consider a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, including collateral performance, marketability, asset class or sector considerations, local and regional economic conditions, NRSRO credit ratings, and/or the financial health of the underlying issuer.\nIn light of recent market volatility stemming from COVID-19, we are taking additional steps to monitor our credit risk on investments. These steps include temporarily suspending business to Bank counterparties with increased credit risk and performing additional analysis on our unsecured portfolios. In addition, we continue to monitor market volatility and counterparty ratings, counterparty pricing, news, sovereign and counterparty research, market research and articles, and other COVID-19 analysis.\nFinance Agency regulations limit the type of investments we may purchase. We are prohibited from investing in financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks, unless otherwise approved by the Finance Agency. Our unsecured credit exposures to U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks include the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, the counterparty may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Our unsecured credit exposures to domestic counterparties and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign commercial banks include the risk that these counterparties have extended credit to foreign counterparties. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the above regulation and did not own any financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities, other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks, and those approved by the Finance Agency.\nFinance Agency regulations also include limits on the amount of unsecured credit we may extend to a counterparty or to a group of affiliated counterparties. These limits are based on a percentage of eligible regulatory capital and the counterparty's overall credit rating. Under these regulations, the level of eligible regulatory capital is determined as the lesser of our total regulatory capital or the eligible amount of regulatory capital of the counterparty. The eligible amount of regulatory capital is then multiplied by a stated percentage. The percentage that we may offer for extensions of unsecured credit, excluding overnight federal funds sold, ranges from three to 15 percent based on the counterparty's credit rating. Our total unsecured exposure to a counterparty, including overnight federal funds sold, may not exceed twice that amount, or a total of six to 30 percent of the eligible amount of regulatory capital, based on the counterparty's credit rating. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the regulatory limits established for unsecured credit.\nOur short-term portfolio may include, but is not limited to, interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury obligations. Our long-term portfolio may include, but is not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, taxable municipal bonds, and MBS. We consider our long-term investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, or the FDIC to be of the highest credit quality and therefore those exposures are not monitored with other unsecured investments. Given the credit quality of our unsecured long-term investments, our unsecured credit risk is primarily in the short-term portfolio.\nWe primarily limit short-term unsecured credit exposure to the following overnight investment types:\n\u2022Interest-bearing deposits. Primarily consists of unsecured deposits that earn interest.\n\u2022Federal funds sold. Unsecured loans of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Banks between financial institutions.\n\u2022Commercial paper. Unsecured debt issued by corporations, typically for the financing of accounts receivable, inventories, and meeting short-term liabilities.\nAt December 31, 2020, our unsecured short-term investment exposure consisted of overnight interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold.

rating available for each investment based on an NRSRO, or the guarantor credit rating, if applicable.

We adopted new accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we determined no allowance for credit losses was necessary on our investments. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Investments\u201d for additional information our allowance for credit losses.\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nWe are exposed to mortgage asset credit risk through our investments in MBS. Mortgage asset credit risk is the risk that we will not receive timely payments of principal and interest due from mortgage borrowers because of borrower defaults. Credit risk on mortgage assets is affected by a number of factors, including the strength and ability to guarantee the payments from the agency that created the structure, underlying loan performance, and other economic factors in the local market or nationwide. We limit our purchases of MBS to those guaranteed by the U.S. Government or issued by a GSE. Our risk management policies prohibit new purchases of private-label MBS. We perform ongoing analysis on these investments to determine potential credit issues.\nDERIVATIVES\nWe execute most of our derivative transactions with large banks and major broker-dealers. Over-the-counter derivative transactions may be either executed directly with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent), with a Derivative Clearing Organization (cleared derivatives).\nWe are subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative agreements. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures and collateral requirements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. We manage credit risk through credit analyses, collateral requirements, and adherence to the requirements set forth in our policies and Finance Agency regulations.\nUncleared Derivatives. Due to risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative agreements, we generally require collateral on uncleared derivative agreements. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty or a contractually established threshold level. A counterparty generally must deliver collateral to us if the total market value of our exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, we do not anticipate any credit losses on our uncleared derivative agreements.\nCleared Derivatives. For cleared derivatives, the Clearinghouse is our counterparty. We are subject to risk of nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that we post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes us to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. However, the use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral/payments is posted daily, through a clearing agent, for changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives. We do not anticipate any credit losses on our cleared derivatives.\nThe contractual or notional amount of derivatives reflects our involvement in the various classes of financial instruments. Our maximum credit risk is the estimated cost of replacing derivatives if there is a default, minus the value of any related collateral. In determining maximum credit risk, we consider accrued interest receivables and payables as well as our ability to net settle positive and negative positions with the same counterparty and/or clearing agent when netting requirements are met.\nThe following table shows our derivative counterparty credit exposure (dollars in millions):\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Rating1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Notional Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Derivatives\nFair Value Before Collateral </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Collateral Pledged\nTo (From) Counterparty </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Credit Exposure\nto Counterparties </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-member counterparties: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset positions with credit exposure </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncleared derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liability positions with credit exposure </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncleared derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cleared derivatives3\n</td> <td> </td> <td>29,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total derivative positions with credit exposure to non-member counterparties </td> <td> </td> <td>31,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(76) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Member institutions4\n</td> <td> </td> <td>175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>31,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(75) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative positions without credit exposure </td> <td> </td> <td>4,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total notional </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Represents either the lowest credit rating available for each counterparty based on an NRSRO, or the guarantor credit rating, if applicable.\n2 Net credit exposure is less than $1 million.\n3 Represents derivative transactions cleared with CME Clearing, our clearinghouse, who is not rated.

In addition, we continue to monitor market volatility and counterparty ratings, counterparty pricing, news, sovereign and counterparty research, market research and articles, and other COVID-19 analysis.\nOperational Risk\nWe define operational risk as the risk arising from inadequate or failed processes, people, and/or systems, including those emanating from external sources. All of our activities and processes generate operational risk, including legal risk. Management has established policies, procedures, and controls to reduce the likelihood of operational risk. We perform annual risk assessments to identify, assess, mitigate, and report on operational risks outside of the Board's risk appetite. Due to the manual nature of many of our processes, our operational risk exposure is closely monitored.\nIn response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the majority of our employees continue to work remotely, with a limited number of employees voluntarily working from our headquarters. Many of our members, vendors, and regulators continue to work remotely. While our operations have changed as a result of the global pandemic, we currently do not believe the current working arrangement creates additional operational risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\nModel Risk\nWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect and misused model outputs. Throughout the course of our day-to-day activities, we utilize external and internal pricing and financial models as important inputs into business and risk management decision-making processes.\nWe use sophisticated risk management systems to evaluate our financial position and risk exposure. These systems employ various mathematical models and valuation techniques to measure interest rate risk and credit risk. For example, we use valuation techniques designed to model explicit and embedded options and other cash flow uncertainties across a number of hypothetical interest rate environments. The techniques used to model options rely on:\n\u2022understanding the contractual and behavioral features of each instrument;\n\u2022using appropriate market data, such as yield curves and implied volatilities; and\n\u2022using appropriate option valuation models and prepayment estimates or forecasts to describe the evolution of interest rates over time and the expected cash flows of financial instruments in response.\nThe method for calculating fair value is dependent on the instrument type. Option-free instruments, such as plain vanilla interest rate swaps, bonds, and advances require an assessment of the future course of interest rates. Once the course of interest rates has been specified and the expected cash flows determined, future cash flows are discounted to compute the fair value. Options and option-embedded instruments, such as cancelable interest rate swaps, swaptions, interest rate caps and floors, callable bonds, and mortgage-related instruments, are typically evaluated using an interest rate tree (lattice) or Monte Carlo simulations that generate a large number of possible interest rate scenarios.\nModels are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on assumptions about future performance. Changes in any models or in any of the assumptions, judgments, or estimates used in the models may cause the results generated by the model to be materially different. Our risk computations require the use of instantaneous shifts in assumptions, such as interest rates, spreads, volatilities, and prepayment speeds. These computations may differ from our actual interest rate risk exposure because they do not take into account any portfolio re-balancing and hedging actions that are required to maintain risk exposures within our policies and guidelines. We have adopted controls, procedures, and policies to monitor and manage assumptions used in these models which are regularly validated.\nInformation Security Risk\nWe define information security risk as the risk arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information or information systems. Importantly, this definition includes the security of both digital and non-digital information as well as associated information systems and processes.\nInformation security risk includes the risk that cyber incidents could result in a failure or interruption of our business operations. We have not experienced any such disruption with a material adverse impact. However, we do rely heavily on internal and third-party information systems and other technology to conduct and manage our business and any disruptions to those items could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We mitigate cybersecurity risk utilizing the concept of defense in depth, where multiple layers of security controls are implemented. Administrative, physical, and logical controls are in place for identifying, monitoring, and controlling system access, sensitive data, and system changes. In addition, we employ thorough security testing and training that includes regular third party facilitated penetration testing, as well as mandatory staff training on cyber risks. Given the importance of cybersecurity and ever-increasing sophistication of potential cyber-attacks, we have recently strengthened our cyber-defenses and expect to continue to do so.\nCompliance Risk\nWe define compliance risk as the risk of violations of laws, rules, regulations, regulatory and supervisory guidance, and internal policies and procedures. Our Legal and Compliance departments are responsible for coordinating with our various business units in connection with its identification, evaluation, and mitigation of our compliance risks.\nStrategic Risk\nWe define strategic risk as the risk arising from adverse strategic business decisions, poor implementation and/or execution of strategic plans, or a disproportionate response to changes in the industry and operating environment. We consider legislative and reputational risks to be components of strategic risk. From time to time, proposals are made, or legislative and regulatory changes are considered, which could affect our cost of doing business or other aspects of our business. We mitigate strategic risk through strategic business planning and monitoring of our external and internal environment. For additional information on some of the more important risks we face, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d", "item_7_truncated": "6 The hedging activity tables do not include the interest component on the related hedged items or the gross prepayment fee income on terminated advance or investment hedge relationships.\n\nWe are subject to certain liquidity requirements set forth by the Finance Agency, as further outlined below.

We monitor our debt refinancing risk and liquidity position primarily by tracking the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, we consider contractual maturities of our financial assets and liabilities, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments). External factors, including member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may affect liquidity balances and the funding balances between financial assets and financial liabilities.

Financial Statements\u201d for additional information regarding the contractual maturities or redemption terms of certain of our financial assets and liabilities.\nOn January 22, 2021, the FDIC published a final rule, effective April 1, 2021, that amends its brokered deposits regulations that apply to less than well-capitalized insured depository institutions. The FDIC stated that the amendments are intended to modernize and clarify the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations and they establish a new framework for analyzing the deposit broker definition, which determines whether deposits placed through deposit placement arrangements qualify as brokered deposits. These deposit placement arrangements include those between insured depository institutions and third parties, such as financial technology companies, for a variety of business purposes, including access to deposits. The amendments to the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations, among other things, clarify what it means to be engaged in the business of facilitating the placement of deposits and expand the scope of the primary purpose exception. The rule amendments are expected to have the effect of narrowing the definition of deposit broker and excluding more deposits from treatment as brokered deposits. The amendments also establish an application and reporting process with respect to the primary purpose exception for businesses that do not meet one of several bright-line tests, and they affirm the FDIC's position that the brokering of certificates of deposit constitutes deposit brokering.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate conventional loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,712 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate government-insured loans </td> <td>481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>496 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unpaid principal balance </td> <td>8,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discounts </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis adjustments from mortgage loan purchase commitments </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total mortgage loans held for portfolio </td> <td>8,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for credit losses </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total mortgage loans held for portfolio, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,334 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Sum of Total Exposure </td> <td> </td> <td>% Collateralized </td> <td> </td> <td>Sum of Total Exposure </td> <td> </td> <td>% Collateralized </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial banks </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>795 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>421 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings institutions </td> <td>790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>476 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit unions </td> <td>5,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-captive insurance companies </td> <td>26,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td>20,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Captive insurance companies1\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CDFIs </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Housing associates </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>281 </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-member borrowers </td> <td>196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td>273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowers </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>447 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>339 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity Reserves for Deposits - We are required to have available at all times an amount greater than or equal to members' current deposits invested in advances with maturities not to exceed five years, deposits in banks or trust companies, and obligations of the U.S. Treasury.

For example, we may issue and hedge a fixed rate consolidated obligation with an interest rate swap where we receive a fixed rate coupon and pay a variable rate coupon, effectively converting the fixed rate consolidated obligation to a variable rate consolidated obligation. This type of hedge is typically treated as a fair value hedge. We may also issue variable interest rate consolidated obligations and simultaneously execute interest rate swaps to hedge the basis risk of the variable interest rate debt.

Enforcement of the final rule will phase in over three years. The final rule replaces the four existing retrospective housing goals with a single prospective mortgage purchase housing goal target in which 20 percent of Acquired Member Asset (AMA) mortgages purchased in a year must be comprised of loans to low-income or very low-income families, or to families in low-income areas. The final rule also establishes a separate small member participation housing goal with a target level in which 50 percent of the members selling acquired member asset (AMA) loans in a calendar year must be small members. The final rule provides that an FHLBank may request Finance Agency approval of alternative target levels for either or both of the goals. The final rule also establishes that housing goals apply to each FHLBank that acquires any AMA mortgages during a year, eliminating the existing $2.5 billion volume threshold that previously triggered the application of housing goals for each FHLBank.\n\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial banks </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,835 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings institutions </td> <td>702 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,376 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit unions </td> <td>4,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,976 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-captive insurance companies </td> <td>26,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,821 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Captive insurance companies </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,798 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Community development financial institutions </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total member advances </td> <td>45,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,820 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Housing associates </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-member borrowers </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par value </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022using appropriate market data, such as yield curves and implied volatilities; and\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Qualifying assets free of lien or pledge </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated obligations outstanding </td> <td>79.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess liquidity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe execute most of our derivative transactions with large banks and major broker-dealers.

The fair values of derivatives are netted by clearing agent and/or counterparty when the netting requirements have been met. If these netted amounts result in a receivable to the Bank, they are classified as a derivative asset and, if classified as a payable to the clearing agent or counterparty, they are classified as a derivative liability.

Transactions that meet certain criteria qualify for short-cut hedge accounting in which an assumption can be made that the change in fair value of a hedged item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate exactly offsets the change in fair value of the related derivative. Under the short-cut method, the entire change in fair value of the interest rate swap is considered to be highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability. If documented at the time of hedge designation, a derivative relationship no longer qualifying for short-cut hedge accounting can fallback to the long-haul accounting method.\n3 Represents the interest component on derivatives that qualify for fair value hedge accounting.\nInterest Rates\n\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Policy Limits </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Down 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Base Case </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 100 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 and 2019 </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInformation Security Risk\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual services </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal Housing Finance Agency </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office of Finance </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net gains and losses on derivatives and hedged items are recorded in net interest income.

Mortgage asset credit risk is the risk that we will not receive timely payments of principal and interest due from mortgage borrowers because of borrower defaults. Credit risk on mortgage assets is affected by a number of factors, including the strength and ability to guarantee the payments from the agency that created the structure, underlying loan performance, and other economic factors in the local market or nationwide. We limit our purchases of MBS to those guaranteed by the U.S. Government or issued by a GSE. Our risk management policies prohibit new purchases of private-label MBS. We perform ongoing analysis on these investments to determine potential credit issues.\nIn addition to the requirements previously discussed, during 2019, the Finance Agency finalized an Advisory Bulletin on capital stock (the Capital Stock AB) which required each FHLBank to maintain at all times a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets, effective February 2020. For purposes of the Capital Stock AB, capital stock includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The capital stock to total assets ratio is measured on a daily average basis at month end. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the Capital Stock AB. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Capital\u201d for additional information on our capital requirements.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio primarily to provide investment income and liquidity. Our primary credit risk on investments is the counterparties' ability to meet repayment terms. We mitigate this credit risk by purchasing investment quality securities. We define investment quality as a security with adequate financial backings so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security. We consider a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, including collateral performance, marketability, asset class or sector considerations, local and regional economic conditions, NRSRO credit ratings, and/or the financial health of the underlying issuer.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan-to-Value1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>MPF </td> <td> </td> <td>MPP </td> </tr>\n<tr><td><= 60% </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 60% to 70% </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 70% to 80% </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 80% to 90%2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 90%2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average loan-to-value </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCleared Derivatives. For cleared derivatives, the Clearinghouse is our counterparty. We are subject to risk of nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that we post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes us to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. However, the use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral/payments is posted daily, through a clearing agent, for changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives. We do not anticipate any credit losses on our cleared derivatives.\n1 Excludes $1.5 billion of advances with North American Company for Life and Health Insurance, an affiliate of Midland National Life Insurance Company.\nWe consider an advance past due for financial reporting purposes if a default of contractual principal or interest exists for a period of 30 days or more. In light of the above event, as of February 28, 2021, we have advances outstanding with a par value of $365 million that are considered past due.

The Supervisory Letter provided that the FHLBanks should, by March 31, 2020, cease entering into new LIBOR referenced financial assets, liabilities, and derivatives with maturities beyond December 31, 2021 for all product types except investments. With respect to investments, the FHLBanks were required, by December 31, 2019, to stop purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021. These phase-out dates did not apply to collateral accepted by the FHLBanks. The Supervisory Letter also directed the FHLBanks to update their pledged collateral certification reporting requirements by March 31, 2020, in an effort to encourage members to distinguish LIBOR-linked collateral maturing after December 31, 2021. The FHLBanks were expected to cease entering into LIBOR-indexed financial instruments maturing after December 31, 2021, by the deadlines specified in the Supervisory Letter, subject to limited exceptions granted by the Finance Agency for LIBOR-linked products serving compelling mission, risk mitigating, and/or hedging purposes that do not currently have readily available alternatives. We ceased purchasing investments that reference LIBOR in 2018.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate cash dividends paid1\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective combined annualized dividend rate paid on capital stock2\n</td> <td>4.86 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized dividend rate paid on membership capital stock </td> <td>3.06 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized dividend rate paid on activity-based capital stock </td> <td>5.56 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average three-month LIBOR </td> <td>0.64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average SOFR </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 The amount at December 31, 2020 was less than $1 million.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>ROACS </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change from Base Case </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Policy Limits (declines from base case) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Down 200 </td> <td> </td> <td>Down 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Down 50 </td> <td> </td> <td>Base Case </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 50 </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 200 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 and 2019 </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows conventional MPF and MPP loans by FICO\u00ae score.

During 2020, our net interest margin was 0.45 percent compared to 0.42 percent and 0.43 percent for the same periods in 2019 and 2018. The increase in net interest margin during 2020 when compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to higher asset-liability spreads, offset in part by the lower interest rate environment.\nAs a result of our credit quality and GSE status, we generally have ready access to funding at relatively competitive interest rates. During 2020, our short-term funding spreads to LIBOR, on average, were generally more favorable when compared to 2019. As such, we utilized short-term discount notes in an effort to capture attractive funding, match the repricing structures on floating rate assets, and meet our liquidity requirements. During 2020, our long-term funding spreads to LIBOR, on average, generally deteriorated when compared to 2019. Our funding spreads were mixed relative to U.S. Treasuries when compared to the same periods in the prior year.\nModel Risk\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Advances </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal Life Insurance Company </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EquiTrust Life Insurance Company </td> <td>3,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midland National Life Insurance Company1\n</td> <td>3,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Washington Federal Bank, National Association </td> <td>2,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transamerica Life Insurance Company </td> <td>2,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par value </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinance Agency regulations limit the type of investments we may purchase.

On that date, all legacy bilateral derivative transactions subject to Protocol-covered agreements (including ISDA agreements) that incorporate certain covered ISDA definitional booklets and reference a covered Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR), including LIBOR, were effectively amended to apply the new ISDA-recommended IBOR fallbacks in the event of the relevant IBOR's cessation. Both the Bank and our counterparty must have adhered to the Protocol in order to effectively amend legacy derivatives contracts, otherwise the parties must bilaterally amend legacy covered agreements (including ISDA agreements) to address LIBOR fallbacks. The Protocol will remain open for adherence after the effective date. As of January 25, 2021, all new derivative contracts are subject to the relevant IBOR fallbacks set forth in the Supplement.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>ROACS Spread to Reference Rate % Change from Base Case </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Down 200 </td> <td> </td> <td>Down 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Base Case </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 200 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td>(2.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 </td> <td>(2.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe utilize several sources of liquidity to carry out our business activities.

Our mission is to be a reliable provider of funding, liquidity, and services for our members so that they can meet the housing, business, and economic development needs of the communities they serve. Our operating model balances the trade-off between attractively priced products, reasonable returns on capital stock, maintaining an adequate level of capital to meet regulatory capital requirements, and maintaining adequate retained earnings to preserve the par value of member-owned capital stock. Our members include commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, insurance companies, and CDFIs.\nThe following table summarizes our regulatory capital stock by type of member (dollars in millions):\nOnce a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse), the derivative transaction is novated and the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legislative and Regulatory Developments.\u201d\nWe define market risk as the risk that changes in market prices may adversely affect our financial condition and performance. Interest rate risk is the principal type of market risk to which we are exposed as our cash flows, and therefore earnings and equity value, can change significantly as interest rates change. Our general approach toward managing interest rate risk is to acquire and maintain a portfolio of assets, liabilities, and derivatives, which taken together, limit our expected exposure to interest rate risk. Management regularly reviews our sensitivity to interest rate changes by monitoring our market risk measures in parallel and non-parallel interest rate changes and spread and volatility movements.\nFINANCE AGENCY SUPERVISORY LETTER - PLANNING FOR LIBOR PHASE-OUT\nInterest rate risk stress tests of MVCS involve instantaneous parallel and non-parallel changes in interest rates. The resulting percentage change in MVCS from the base case value is an indication of longer-term repricing risk and option risk embedded in the balance sheet.\nFor a discussion of our key capital adequacy measure, MVCS, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Market Risk - Market Value of Capital Stock Sensitivity.\u201d\nAlthough management has policies and procedures in place to manage credit risk, we may be exposed to this risk if our outstanding advance value exceeds the liquidation value of our collateral. We mitigate this risk by applying collateral discounts or haircuts to the unpaid principal balance or market value, as applicable, of the collateral to determine the advance equivalent value of the collateral securing each borrower's obligation. The amount of these discounts will vary based on the type of collateral and security agreement. We determine these discounts or haircuts using data based upon historical price changes, discounted cash flow analyses, and loan level modeling.\n6 Non-accrual loans are included in the average balance used to determine the average yield.\n\nWhen fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, we either terminate the derivative or continue to carry the derivative on the Statements of Condition at its fair value. For any remaining hedged item, we cease to adjust the hedged item for changes in fair value and amortize the cumulative basis adjustment on the hedged item into earnings over the remaining contractual life of the hedged item using a level-yield methodology.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, advances outstanding to our five largest member borrowers totaled $15.5 billion and $39.3 billion, representing 34 percent and 49 percent of our total advances outstanding. The following table summarizes advances outstanding to our five largest member borrowers at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\nBecause membership is voluntary, a member can provide a notice of withdrawal from membership at any time. If a member provides a notice of withdrawal from membership, we will not repurchase or redeem any membership stock until five years from the date of receipt of a notice of withdrawal. To the extent membership is terminated involuntarily, we may elect to repurchase that institution's membership stock prior to the end of the five-year redemption period. If a member withdraws or is involuntarily terminated from membership and holds activity-based capital stock, we will repurchase any such stock that is not required to support remaining business activity with the institution.\nThe following table presents changes in interest income and interest expense. Changes in interest income and interest expense that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but rather equally attributable to both volume and rate changes, are allocated to the volume and rate categories based on the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes (dollars in millions).\n1 Short-term investments have original maturities equal to or less than one year.\nThe following table shows our derivative counterparty credit exposure (dollars in millions):\n1 MBS are presented by contractual maturity, however, their expected maturities will likely differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees.\n3 Represents derivative transactions cleared with CME Clearing, our clearinghouse, who is not rated.

Due to risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative agreements, we generally require collateral on uncleared derivative agreements. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty or a contractually established threshold level. A counterparty generally must deliver collateral to us if the total market value of our exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, we do not anticipate any credit losses on our uncleared derivative agreements.\n1 Source: The Office of Finance.\n\u2022Increase in retained earnings: We recorded net income of $362 million during 2020, which included net gains on litigation settlements in the amount of $120 million. Dividend payments for 2020 totaled $203 million. The earnings in excess of dividend payments had a positive impact on the market value of our assets, thereby increasing MVCS.\nWe also use liquidity to purchase mortgage loans, redeem member deposits, pledge collateral to derivative counterparties, redeem or repurchase capital stock, pay expenses, and pay dividends.\n1 Excludes contractual interest payments related to bonds.

Other income (loss) was primarily impacted by net gains on litigation settlements of $120 million in 2020 as a result of settlements with defendants in our private-label MBS litigation. We did not record any litigation settlements during 2019. Other factors impacting other income (loss) included net gains (losses) on trading securities and net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, borrowers pledged $280.5 billion and $329.4 billion of collateral (net of applicable discounts) to support activity with us, including advances. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of our advances met the requirement to be collateralized at a minimum of 100 percent, net of applicable discounts.

In 2020, we also began utilizing interest rate swaps based on the federal funds or SOFR OIS rates as an alternative to using LIBOR when entering into new derivative transactions.\nBeginning January 1, 2019, we adopted new hedge accounting guidance, which impacted the presentation of gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities for qualifying hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, any hedge ineffectiveness, or the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in fair value of the hedged item, was recorded in other income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d Two approaches to fair value hedge accounting include:\nIn March 2020, the FOMC lowered the Federal Reserve's key target interest rate, the federal funds rate, to a range of zero to 0.25 percent and maintained that range throughout 2020, compared to a range of 1.50 to 1.75 percent for 2019.\nWe primarily limit short-term unsecured credit exposure to the following overnight investment types:\nAs noted throughout this report, many of our advances, investments, consolidated obligation bonds, derivatives, and related collateral are indexed to LIBOR. Some of these assets and liabilities and related collateral have maturity dates that extend beyond 2021. We are preparing for a transition away from LIBOR and plan to utilize SOFR as the dominant replacement rate on an ongoing basis. We have developed a transition plan that will change with market developments and member needs and addresses considerations such as LIBOR exposure, member products, fallback language, operational preparedness, and balance sheet management.\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin 2020-01 Federal Home Loan Bank AMA Risk Management\nWe do not expect these rules to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThis strategy of issuing consolidated obligations while simultaneously entering into derivatives enables us to offer a wider range of attractively priced advances to our borrowers and may allow us to reduce our funding costs. While consolidated obligations are the joint and several obligations of the FHLBanks, each FHLBank serves as sole counterparty to derivative agreements associated with specific debt issues for which it is the primary obligor.\nUnpledged Qualifying Assets - We are required to maintain, in the aggregate, unpledged qualifying assets in an amount at least equal to the amount of our participation in total consolidated obligations outstanding. The following table shows our compliance with this requirement (dollars in billions):\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak developed during 2020, the capital markets became more volatile. Despite the increased market volatility, we were operationally prepared, maintained continual access to funding, and issued debt to meet the needs of our members. Access to debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preference and our government affiliation, have sought the FHLBanks' debt as an asset of choice. However, due to the short-term maturity of the debt, we may be exposed to additional risks associated with refinancing and our ability to access the capital markets.\nFor additional information on our consolidated obligations, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity - Sources of Liquidity.\u201d\nFor prices obtained externally, we have control processes in place to ensure fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. These processes include but are not limited to; challenging a price when it falls out of our tolerance parameters and identifying a stale price, significantly changed price, or other anomalies that may indicate that a price may not be accurate. In addition, on an annual basis, we conduct reviews of our pricing vendors to confirm and further augment our understanding of the vendors' pricing processes, methodologies, and control procedures for investment securities. For internal pricing models, the underlying assumptions are based on management's best estimates for discount rates, prepayments, market volatility, and other factors. The assumptions used in both external and internal pricing models could have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including the related income and expense. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in materially different values.\nWe evaluate mortgage loans for credit losses on a quarterly basis and establish an allowance for credit losses to reflect management's estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio. We adopted new accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2020.\nThe following table shows the five largest state concentrations of our conventional MPF portfolio. All percentages are calculated based on unpaid principal balances as of the applicable period end.\nModels are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on assumptions about future performance. Changes in any models or in any of the assumptions, judgments, or estimates used in the models may cause the results generated by the model to be materially different. Our risk computations require the use of instantaneous shifts in assumptions, such as interest rates, spreads, volatilities, and prepayment speeds. These computations may differ from our actual interest rate risk exposure because they do not take into account any portfolio re-balancing and hedging actions that are required to maintain risk exposures within our policies and guidelines. We have adopted controls, procedures, and policies to monitor and manage assumptions used in these models which are regularly validated.\n\u2022Expands eligibility for unemployment insurance and payment amounts; and\n\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON ECONOMIC HEDGES\nFurther, on January 5, 2021, the CFTC published a final rule, effective February 4, 2021, that primarily amends the minimum margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps under the jurisdiction of the CFTC (CFTC Margin Rules) by requiring covered entities to use a revised AANA calculation starting on September 1, 2022. The amendments, among other things, require entities subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction to calculate the AANA for uncleared swaps during March, April and May of the current year, based on an average of month-end dates, as opposed to the previous requirement which required the calculation of AANA during June, July and August of the prior year, based on daily calculations. Parties would continue to be expected to exchange IM based on the AANA totals as of September 1 of the current year. These amendments align with the recommendation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions. Separately, on January 25, 2021, the CFTC published a final rule, effective February 24, 2021, that amends the CFTC Margin Rules to permit, among other changes, covered swap entities to maintain separate minimum transfer amounts (MTA) for IM and variation margin for each swap counterparty, provided the combined MTA does not exceed $500,000.\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden (and before him, President Trump), through executive orders, governmental agencies, including the SEC, OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, National Credit Union Administration, CFTC and the Finance Agency, as well as state governments and agencies, have taken, and may continue to take, actions to provide various forms of relief from, and guidance regarding, the financial, operational, credit, market, and other effects of the pandemic, some of which may have a direct or indirect impact on us or our members. Many of these actions are temporary in nature. We continue to monitor these actions and guidance as they evolve and to evaluate their potential impact on us.\n1 Represents the amortization/accretion of basis adjustments on closed hedge relationships.\nIn an effort to protect the MVCS from large interest rate swings, we manage the interest rate risk of our balance sheet by using hedging transactions, such as issuing consolidated obligation bonds, including floating rate, simple bullet, callable, or other structured features and entering into or canceling interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and swaptions.\nStatements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, including statements describing the objectives, projections, estimates, or future predictions in our operations, may be forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as believes, projects, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, could, should, may, and will or their negatives or other variations on these terms. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk or uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied or could affect the extent to which a particular objective, projection, estimate, or prediction is realized. As a result, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties is included under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\n\n\n9 Represents net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.\nThe following table summarizes advances by interest rate payment and redemption terms (dollars in millions):\n1 Concessions represent fees paid to dealers in connection with the issuance of certain consolidated obligation bonds.\nOn January 14, 2021, Treasury and Fannie Mae entered into a letter agreement amending the terms of their Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (PSPA), which could impact PFIs that participate in the MPF Program's MPF Xtra product (where MPF loans acquired are concurrently sold to Fannie Mae). Under the PSPA, Treasury provides liquidity to Fannie Mae in exchange for senior preferred stock. Under the recent PSPA amendment, effective January 1, 2022, the Finance Agency (acting as conservator for Fannie Mae) and Treasury agreed to limit the dollar volume of loans Fannie Mae could purchase from a single seller through Fannie Mae's cash window to $1.5 billion per year. As administrator of the MPF Program, the FHLBank of Chicago purchases MPF Xtra loans from PFIs and sells them to Fannie Mae via the cash window process. Based on volumes for the MPF Xtra product program-wide in 2020, the PSPA amendment would significantly curtail MPF Xtra cash window sales. Although this would negatively impact the volume of loans sold through the MPF Program unless a solution is developed, we do not currently expect it to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nProjected income sensitivity is measured as the change in spread between projected 24-month return on average capital stock (ROACS) and an average projected reference rate. Effective July 1, 2020, we utilize average projected SOFR as our reference rate. Prior to July 1, 2020, we utilized average projected three-month LIBOR as our reference rate.\nInterest income on investments decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019 due primarily to the lower interest rate environment. Interest income on investments increased during 2019 when compared to 2018 due primarily to higher average money market investment balances as a result of increased liquidity needs resulting from advance demand during 2019 and the higher interest rate environment on average. This increase was partially offset by lower average MBS and other investment balances.\nWe utilize economic derivatives to manage certain risks on our Statements of Condition. Gains and losses on economic derivatives are driven by changes in interest rates and volatility and include interest settlements. Interest settlements represent the interest component on economic derivatives. These amounts vary from period to period depending on our hedging activities and interest rates. During 2020, we recorded net losses of $48 million on our economic derivatives. The fair value changes were primarily driven by changes in interest rates which impacted the fair value of interest rate swaps used to economically hedge our investment securities portfolio as highlighted in the table below. These changes were primarily driven by market volatility caused by COVID-19 and the impact it had on interest rates.\n\n2 Net credit exposure is less than $1 million.\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES AND HEDGED ITEMS\nLIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS\n2 Prepayment fees on investments, net includes basis adjustment amortization and premium and/or discount amortization.\n\nInterest expense on bonds decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019 due primarily to the lower interest rate environment and lower average bond balances, largely driven by a decrease in the amount of consolidated obligations needed to fund our assets. In addition, during 2020, we increased our usage of shorter-term discount notes relative to bonds in an effort to capture attractive funding, match the repricing structures on floating rate assets, and meet our liquidity requirements. Interest expense on bonds increased during 2019 when compared to 2018 due primarily to the higher interest rate environment on average, offset in part by lower average bond balances driven by a reduction in total assets.\nThe following table shows our 24-month projected ROACS spread to the average projected reference rate and associated policy limits, assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n4 Represents mortgage loan purchase commitments with our member institutions.\n\u2022Step-Down Bonds. These bonds pay interest at decreasing fixed rates for specified intervals over the life of the bond. These bonds generally contain provisions enabling us to call the bonds at our option on the step-down dates.\n\u2022loans and securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof, including MBS issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae;\nINTEREST RATE PAYMENT TERMS\nGovernment-Insured Mortgage Loans. We invest in government-insured fixed rate mortgage loans that are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and/or the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture. The servicer or PFI obtains and maintains insurance or a guaranty from the applicable government agency. The servicer or PFI is responsible for compliance with all government agency requirements and for obtaining the benefit of the applicable guarantee or insurance with respect to defaulted government-insured mortgage loans. Any losses incurred on these loans that are not recovered from the insurer/guarantor are absorbed by the servicers. As such, we only have credit risk for these loans if the servicer or PFI fails to pay for losses not covered by the guarantee or insurance.\nMORTGAGE LOANS\n3 Represents the interest component on derivatives that qualify for fair value hedge accounting.\nWe are subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative agreements. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures and collateral requirements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. We manage credit risk through credit analyses, collateral requirements, and adherence to the requirements set forth in our policies and Finance Agency regulations.\nWe use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. The notional amount of derivatives serves as a factor in determining periodic interest payments and cash flows received and paid. However, the notional amount of derivatives represents neither the actual amounts exchanged nor our overall exposure to credit and market risk.\n3 Represents investment securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\nWe manage the credit risk on mortgage loans by (i) adhering to our underwriting standards, (ii) using agreements to establish credit risk sharing responsibilities with our PFIs, and (iii) monitoring the performance of the mortgage loan portfolio and creditworthiness of PFIs.\nAs a result of the final rule on membership issued by the Finance Agency effective February 19, 2016, the eligibility requirements for FHLBank members were changed, rendering captive insurance company members ineligible for FHLBank membership. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members prior to September 12, 2014, had their memberships terminated February 19, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, while we had five captive insurance company members, none had advances outstanding.\nWe evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. While management believes our estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on historical experience and other factors, actual results could differ from those estimates and differences could be material to the financial statements.\n\n\nThe following table presents comparative highlights of our net income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions). See further discussion of changes in our results of operations in the sections that follow.\n3 The average balance of AFS securities is reflected at amortized cost; therefore the resulting yields do not give effect to changes in fair value.\n\nPROJECTED INCOME SENSITIVITY\nGains and losses on our trading securities are also due primarily to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. The following table summarizes gains and losses on these economic derivatives as well as the related trading securities (dollars in millions):\nOur risk management policies include a target level of retained earnings based on the amount we believe necessary to help protect the redemption value of capital stock, facilitate safe and sound operations, maintain regulatory capital ratios, and support our ability to pay a relatively stable dividend. We monitor our achievement of this target and may utilize tools such as restructuring our balance sheet, generating additional income, reducing our risk exposures, increasing capital stock requirements, or reducing our dividends to achieve our targeted level of retained earnings. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our actual retained earnings exceeded our retained earnings target.\n\nIn assessing our current exposure to LIBOR, we have developed an inventory of financial instruments impacted and identified contracts that may require adding or adjusting the fallback language. We have added or adjusted fallback language to our advance agreements with members and added fallback language to our consolidated obligation agreements. We continue to monitor the market-wide efforts to address fallback language related to derivatives and investment securities as well as fallback language for new activities and issuances of financial instruments. We are in the process of ensuring we are operationally ready, including updating our processes and information technology systems to support the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.\nDuring 2020, we recorded net gains on trading securities of $17 million compared to net gains of $28 million in 2019. These changes in fair value were primarily due to the impact of changes in interest rates and credit spreads on our fixed rate trading securities which stemmed from market volatility caused by COVID-19. Trading securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected through other income (loss).\nRefer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 - Fair Value\u201d for additional discussion on our fair value measurements.\n\n3 Represents commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).\nNet interest settlements represent the interest component on derivatives. These amounts vary from period to period depending on our hedging activities and interest rates and are partially offset by the interest component on the related hedged item within net interest income. The hedging activity tables do not include the impact of the interest component on the related hedged item.\nOur ability to raise funds in the capital markets as well as our cost of borrowing may be affected by our credit ratings. As of February 28, 2021, our consolidated obligations were rated AA+/A-1+ by Standard and Poor's and Aaa/P-1 by Moody's and both ratings had a stable outlook. In August 2020, Fitch Ratings affirmed the long-term U.S. sovereign AAA rating, but revised the outlook to negative\u201d from stable.\u201d Following this action, Fitch Ratings also affirmed our long-term AAA rating and revised the outlook to negative\u201d from stable.\u201d At February 28, 2021, our consolidated obligations remained rated AAA with a negative outlook by Fitch Ratings. For further discussion of how credit rating changes and our ability to access the capital markets may impact us in the future, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe are exposed to credit risk through our participation in the MPF program and the MPP. Mortgage loan credit risk is the risk that we will not receive timely payments of principal and interest due from mortgage borrowers because of borrower defaults. Credit risk on mortgage loans is affected by a number of factors, including loan type, borrower's credit history, and other factors such as home price fluctuations, unemployment levels, and other economic factors in the local market or nationwide.\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loan portfolio by product type (dollars in millions):\nIn the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded on our Statements of Condition or may be recorded on our Statements of Condition in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transactions. For additional information on our off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nConsolidated obligations, which include bonds and discount notes, are the primary source of funds to support our advances, mortgage loans, and investments. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of consolidated obligations for which we are primarily liable totaled $79.6 billion and $121.1 billion.\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nThe effects of COVID-19 and the response to the virus continue to impact financial markets and overall economic conditions. In keeping with our mission to be a reliable provider of liquidity in all economic environments, we remain dedicated to meeting the needs of members through these challenging and unusual times. We have implemented certain relief measures to help members serve customers affected by COVID-19, such as accommodating forbearance and modifications to pledged loan collateral, allowing electronic signatures on loan documentation in specific circumstances, and adding payment deferment as another viable post-forbearance repayment option for participating financial institution (PFI) servicers to assist impacted borrowers.\n1 Source: Bloomberg.\n\nIn response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the majority of our employees continue to work remotely, with a limited number of employees voluntarily working from our headquarters. Many of our members, vendors, and regulators continue to work remotely. While our operations have changed as a result of the global pandemic, we currently do not believe the current working arrangement creates additional operational risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\nAn adequate capital position is necessary for providing safe and sound operations of the Bank. Our key capital adequacy measures are MVCS and regulatory capital in order to maintain capital levels in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. In addition, we maintain a targeted level of retained earnings to protect the redemption value of capital stock, facilitate safe and sound operations, maintain regulatory capital ratios, and support our ability to pay a relatively stable dividend.\nLiquidity\n2 Net credit exposure is less than $1 million.\nOur Board of Directors may declare and pay different dividends for each subclass of capital stock. Dividend payments may be made in the form of cash and/or additional shares of capital stock. Historically, we have only paid cash dividends. By regulation, we may only pay dividends from current earnings or unrestricted retained earnings. We are prohibited from paying a dividend in the form of additional shares of capital stock if, after the issuance, the outstanding excess capital stock would be greater than one percent of our total assets. Our Board of Directors may not declare or pay dividends if it would result in our non-compliance with regulatory capital requirements.\nMortgage Markets\nBeginning in March 2020, the impact of COVID-19 significantly affected the U.S. housing markets and resulted in declines in interest rates, home inventory, and home sales. In the second half of 2020, the housing market began to show signs of recovery. Home sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 to levels above the fourth quarter of 2019 and housing inventory remained low, resulting in higher home prices. During 2020, mortgage rates continued to decline, on average, and refinancing activity remained the primary driver of mortgage activity.\nFair values play an important role in our valuation of certain assets, liabilities, and hedging transactions. Fair value is first determined based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, where available. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, fair values are determined based on external or internal pricing models that use (i) discounted cash flows using market estimates of interest rates and volatility, (ii) dealer prices, or (iii) prices of similar instruments.\nADVANCES\nMandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock\nInvestments\nThe method for calculating fair value is dependent on the instrument type. Option-free instruments, such as plain vanilla interest rate swaps, bonds, and advances require an assessment of the future course of interest rates. Once the course of interest rates has been specified and the expected cash flows determined, future cash flows are discounted to compute the fair value. Options and option-embedded instruments, such as cancelable interest rate swaps, swaptions, interest rate caps and floors, callable bonds, and mortgage-related instruments, are typically evaluated using an interest rate tree (lattice) or Monte Carlo simulations that generate a large number of possible interest rate scenarios.\nDuring 2020, advance disbursements totaled $146.8 billion compared to $264.6 billion in 2019. Advance disbursements will vary from period to period depending on member needs. During 2020, investment purchases (excluding overnight investments) totaled $19.6 billion compared to $147.2 billion in 2019. Investment purchases during each period were primarily driven by the purchase of money market investments, including secured resale agreements, or U.S. Treasury securities in an effort to manage our liquidity position.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nConsistent with the additional analysis and monitoring on our other Bank products, we are taking additional steps to monitor our derivatives' credit risk given the recent market volatility stemming from COVID-19. In addition, we continue to monitor market volatility and counterparty ratings, counterparty pricing, news, sovereign and counterparty research, market research and articles, and other COVID-19 analysis.\nOur base case MVCS was $171.0 at December 31, 2020 compared to $147.2 at December 31, 2019. The change was primarily attributable to the following factors:\nUSES OF LIQUIDITY\nWe may also enter into economic derivatives in an effort to mitigate the income statement volatility that occurs when consolidated obligations are recorded under the fair value option and hedge accounting is not permitted.\n4 Represents amounts recorded in Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d on the Statements of Income.\nThe following table shows the Bank's total exposure, including advances, as well as the collateralization percentage of outstanding exposures by borrower type (dollars in millions):\nWe evaluate mortgage loans for credit losses on a quarterly basis. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, our allowance for credit losses totaled $1 million. For additional discussion on our mortgage loan credit risk, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Credit Risk - Mortgage Loans.\u201d\nThe Office of Finance and FHLBanks have contingency plans in place that prioritize the allocation of proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations during periods of financial distress if consolidated obligations cannot be issued in sufficient amounts to satisfy all FHLBank demand. In the event of significant market disruptions or local disasters, our President or designee is authorized to establish interim borrowing relationships with other FHLBanks. To provide further access to funding, the FHLBank Act also authorizes the U.S. Treasury to directly purchase new issue consolidated obligations of the GSEs, including FHLBanks, up to an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. As of February 28, 2021, no purchases had been made by the U.S. Treasury under this authorization.\nLiquidity Risk\nWe use our available liquidity, including proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations, primarily to repay consolidated obligations, fund advances, and purchase investments. During 2020, repayments of consolidated obligations totaled $263.0 billion compared to $203.7 billion in 2019. A portion of these payments were due to the call of certain bonds in an effort to better match our projected asset cash flows. During 2020, we called bonds with a total par value of $2.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 2019.\nThird, we cannot redeem shares of capital stock from any member if the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation of the FHLBank System is not paid in full when due, or under certain circumstances if (i) we project, at any time, that we will fail to comply with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements, or will be unable to timely and fully meet all of our current obligations, (ii) we actually fail to comply with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements or to timely and fully meet all of our current obligations, or enter or negotiate to enter into an agreement with one or more other FHLBanks to obtain financial assistance to meet our current obligations, or (iii) the Finance Agency determines that we will cease to be in compliance with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements, or will lack the capacity to timely or fully meet all of our current obligations.\nWe remain focused on both the health and safety of our employees. The majority of our employees continue to work remotely, with a limited number of employees voluntarily working from our headquarters. We have not experienced and do not expect to experience any impairment of our ability to meet the needs of members.\n3 Represents,gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items in qualifying hedging relationships. Amounts do not include the amortization of the financing element of off-market derivatives.\n\n\n\nAdvances\nIn July 2017, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021 it will no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee to identify a set of alternative reference interest rates for possible use as market benchmarks. This committee proposed SOFR as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in the second quarter of 2018. SOFR is based on a broad segment of the overnight Treasury repurchase market and is intended to be a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.\n1 Concessions represent fees paid to dealers in connection with the issuance of certain consolidated obligation discount notes.\n\nBalance Sheet\nLEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\nConventional Mortgage Loans. We determine our allowance for credit losses on conventional loans through analyses that include consideration of various loan portfolio and collateral-related characteristics, such as past performance, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected economic conditions. Conventional mortgage loans are evaluated collectively when similar risk characteristics exists. Conventional loans that do not share risk characteristics with other pools are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis. In limited instances, we may incorporate a management adjustment in the allowance for credit losses for conventional mortgage loans due to changes in economic and business conditions or other factors that may not be fully captured in our model. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the allowance for credit losses on our conventional loans was $1 million.\nThe U.S. Treasury yields have declined to historically low levels and mortgage rates were lower on average during 2020 when compared to 2019. The global concerns related to COVID-19 and the impact on economic activity have led to lower interest rates. As interest rates declined, our net income was negatively impacted.\n3 Represents investment securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\n2 Interest income and expense amounts reported for advances, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), other investments, and consolidated obligation bonds include gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships.\nOur down 200 basis point policy limit is suspended when the 10-year swap rate is below 2.50 percent and remains so for five consecutive days. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the 10-year swap rate had been below 2.50 percent for five consecutive days, and therefore the associated policy limit was suspended.\nOn July 1, 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Farm Credit Administration, and the Finance Agency (collectively, Prudential Banking Regulators) jointly published a final rule, effective August 31, 2020, amending regulations that established minimum margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps for covered swap entities under the jurisdiction of the Prudential Banking Regulators (Prudential Margin Rules). In addition to other changes, the final rule (i) allows swaps entered into by a covered swap entity prior to an applicable compliance date to retain their legacy status and not become subject to the Prudential Margin Rules in the event that the legacy swaps are amended to replace an interbank offered rate (such as LIBOR) or other discontinued rate, or due to other technical amendments, notional reductions or portfolio compression exercises, (ii) introduces a new Phase 6 compliance date for initial margin requirements for covered swap entities and their counterparties with an average daily aggregate notional amount (AANA) of uncleared swaps of at least $8 billion, and (iii) clarifies that initial margin (IM) trading documentation does not need to be executed prior to the parties becoming obligated to exchange IM.\nOther expense increased $21 million during 2020 when compared to 2019, driven primarily by an increase in compensation and benefits. The increase in compensation and benefits was primarily due to increased pension costs as a result of us making a discretionary contribution of $32 million at the end of the year. We did not make a discretionary pension contribution in 2019. This increase was offset in part by a decline in other operating expenses and professional fees. Other operating expenses decreased due to lower depreciation expense on core system projects and fewer employee travel costs in light of COVID-19. Professional fees declined as a result of fewer external resources to assist with our technology and operational initiatives during the year.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our discount notes, all of which are due within one year (dollars in millions):\nWe define credit risk as the potential that our borrowers or counterparties will fail to meet their obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Our primary credit risks arise from our ongoing lending, investing, and hedging activities. Our overall objective in managing credit risk is to operate a sound credit granting process and to maintain appropriate credit administration, measurement, and monitoring practices.\nDISCONTINUANCE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING\nCOVID-19\nFinance Agency regulations also include limits on the amount of unsecured credit we may extend to a counterparty or to a group of affiliated counterparties. These limits are based on a percentage of eligible regulatory capital and the counterparty's overall credit rating. Under these regulations, the level of eligible regulatory capital is determined as the lesser of our total regulatory capital or the eligible amount of regulatory capital of the counterparty. The eligible amount of regulatory capital is then multiplied by a stated percentage. The percentage that we may offer for extensions of unsecured credit, excluding overnight federal funds sold, ranges from three to 15 percent based on the counterparty's credit rating. Our total unsecured exposure to a counterparty, including overnight federal funds sold, may not exceed twice that amount, or a total of six to 30 percent of the eligible amount of regulatory capital, based on the counterparty's credit rating. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the regulatory limits established for unsecured credit.\n1 The change from base case for the up 100 basis point scenario was less than 0.1 percent.\n7 Other interest-bearing liabilities consists of mandatorily redeemable capital stock and borrowings from other FHLBanks.\nNet Income\nOn the same date, the Prudential Banking Regulators published an interim final rule, effective September 1, 2020, extending the IM compliance date for Phase 6 counterparties to September 1, 2022. On November 9, 2020, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) published a final rule extending the IM compliance date for Phase 6 counterparties to September 1, 2022, thereby aligning with the Prudential Banking Regulators.\nThe following table shows conventional MPF and MPP loans by loan-to-value ratio at origination. All percentages are calculated based on unpaid principal balances as of the applicable period end.\nTotal capital decreased to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020 from $6.7 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in capital stock resulting from a decline in member activity. Our regulatory capital ratio increased to 6.55 percent at December 31, 2020, from 5.31 percent at December 31, 2019, and was above the required regulatory minimum at each period end. Regulatory capital includes all capital stock, mandatorily redeemable capital stock, and retained earnings.\nOur key market risk measures are Market Value of Capital Stock (MVCS) Sensitivity and Projected Income Sensitivity.\nConsolidated Obligations\n2 Prepayment fees on investments, net includes basis adjustment amortization and premium and/or discount amortization.\nThe following table summarizes our bonds by interest rate payment terms (dollars in millions):\nWe evaluate advances for credit losses on a quarterly basis and have never experienced a credit loss on our advances. In December 2020, we declared a member bank in default under its contractual terms and individually assessed the related advances for expected credit losses as of December 31, 2020, concluding no allowance for credit losses was necessary in light of the advances being well-secured with underlying collateral. All other advances were evaluated on a collective basis as of December 31, 2020 and, based upon our collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on advances, we determined there were no expected credit losses on those advances.\nWe monitor and manage to the MVCS policy limits in an effort to ensure the stability of the Bank's value. Our policy limits are based on declines from the base case in parallel and non-parallel interest rate change scenarios. Any policy limit breach requires a prompt action to address the measure outside of the policy limit and the breach must be reported to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Bank and the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. We were in compliance with the MVCS policy limits at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nNet interest spread equals the yield on total interest-earning assets minus the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. During 2020, our net interest spread was 0.38 percent compared to 0.29 percent and 0.32 percent for the same periods in 2019 and 2018. Our net interest spread during 2020 was primarily impacted by increased advance prepayment fee income of $66 million compared to the same period in 2019. The primary components of our interest income and interest expense are discussed below.\nThe following table shows information on key market interest rates1:\n\n3 Long-term investments have original maturities of greater than one year.\n\nWe may hedge a firm commitment for a forward-starting advance through the use of an interest-rate swap (fair value hedge). In this case, the interest rate swap functions as the hedging instrument for both the firm commitment and the subsequent advance. We may also enter into economic derivatives in an effort to mitigate the income statement volatility that occurs when an advance or firm commitment for a forward-starting advance is recorded under the fair value option and hedge accounting is not permitted.\nEMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\nWe cannot repurchase or redeem any membership or activity-based capital stock if the repurchase or redemption would cause a member to be out of compliance with its required investment. In addition, there are statutory and regulatory restrictions on our obligation or right to redeem outstanding capital stock.\nMARKET VALUE OF CAPITAL STOCK SENSITIVITY\nThis Liquidity Guidance AB also specifies appropriate funding gap limits to address the risks associated with a FHLBank having too large a mismatch between the contractual maturities of its assets and liabilities. A funding gap measures the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period and is expressed as a percentage of total assets. The guidance provides funding gap limits within the range of negative 10 percent to negative 20 percent for a three-month horizon and negative 25 percent to negative 35 percent for a one-year horizon. Initial guidance, which was in effect at December 31, 2019, was set at a trailing three-month average of negative 15 percent for the three-month horizon and a trailing three-month average of negative 30 percent for the one-year horizon. In addition to the relief provided for base case liquidity noted above, on March 12, 2020, the Finance Agency also increased the funding gap ratios for the three-month and one-year time horizons during the year. The recommended funding gap maximums were reduced to negative 20 percent at the three-month horizon and negative 35 percent at the one-year horizon by December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we adhered to these funding gap requirements.\nWe may enter into certain economic derivatives as macro balance sheet hedges to protect against changes in interest rates, including prepayments on mortgage assets. These economic derivatives may include interest rate caps, floors, swaps, and swaptions.\nOther Expense\nWe define MVCS as an estimate of the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities (excluding mandatorily redeemable capital stock) divided by the total shares of capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) outstanding. It represents an estimation of the liquidation value\u201d of one share of our capital stock if all assets and liabilities were liquidated at current market prices. MVCS does not represent our long-term value, as it takes into account short-term market price fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the long-term value of the cash flows from our assets and liabilities.\nOur bonds decreased $39.3 billion or 43 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in total assets. In addition, we increased our usage of shorter-term discount notes relative to bonds in an effort to capture attractive funding, match the repricing structures on floating rate assets, and meet our liquidity requirements. Fair value hedging adjustments changed $150 million at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019, due to the impact of interest rates on our cumulative fair value adjustments on bonds in hedge relationships.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nWe use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Accounting rules affect the timing and recognition of income and expense on derivatives and therefore we may be subject to income statement volatility.\nHedging Activities\nMargin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities\n5 Represents the net gains (losses) on those trading securities in which we have entered into a corresponding economic derivative to hedge the risk of changes in fair value. As a result, this line item may not agree to the Statements of Income.\n\n2 Represents investment securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\nFinancial Results\nAs a result of recent deteriorating market and economic conditions stemming from COVID-19, we may be subject to increased credit risk on our mortgage loan portfolio. To assist homeowners affected by the current economic conditions, we have implemented several programs, including temporary mortgage payment forbearance and a temporary moratorium on foreclosures and evictions. The extent to which these programs will impact our mortgage portfolio and results of operations\nInterest income on advances decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019, due primarily to the lower interest rate environment and lower average advance balances, partially offset by an increase in advance prepayment fee income. The decrease in average advance balances from prior year was primarily a result of a decline in advances from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and decreased demand for advances across the majority of other institution types, driven primarily by increased liquidity in the financial markets and higher member deposit levels. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in borrowings by non-captive insurance companies. We do not expect significant new advances to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in the near future and this trend of paydowns and decreased new borrowings by members may continue. Interest income on advances increased during 2019 when compared to 2018, due primarily to the higher interest rate environment on average, partially offset by lower average advance balances as a result of a decline in advances from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and captive insurance company members.\nWe evaluate investments for credit losses on a quarterly basis. We adopted new accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we determined no allowance for credit losses was necessary on our investments. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Investments\u201d for additional information our allowance for credit losses.\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank Liquidity (the Liquidity Guidance AB) - This guidance requires us to maintain sufficient liquidity for a period of 10 to 30 calendar days. The base case scenario requires 20 days of positive daily cash balances and assumes that we cannot access the capital markets to issue debt, and during that time we will automatically renew maturing and called advances for all members, including very large highly-rated members, and we hold additional liquid assets equal to one percent of our letters of credit balances. As a result of the deterioration in financial market conditions due to COVID-19, the Finance Agency issued revised guidance in March 2020 lowering the base case liquidity requirements during the year. However, the required calendar days of positive daily cash balances returned to 20 days by December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with this base case liquidity guidance.\n\nFor additional information on our compliance with regulatory capital requirements as well as our targeted retained earnings, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThe path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In its December 16, 2020 statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee) stated that it decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to 0.25 percent. The Committee stated that it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to two percent and is on track to moderately exceed two percent for some time. The Committee stated that the assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures, inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\nThe following table summarizes dividend-related information (dollars in millions):\n1 Average balances are calculated on a daily weighted average basis and do not reflect the effect of derivative master netting arrangements with counterparties and/or clearing agents.\n1 Prepayment fees on advances, net includes basis adjustment amortization and premium and/or discount amortization.\nThe adjusted net income methodology is calculated on a post Affordable Housing Program (AHP) assessment basis. Management believes AHP assessments are a fundamental component of our business and believes this assessment should be included in our adjusted net income calculation. In addition, this treatment aligns the adjusted net income results to our strategic business plan, which is calculated on a post AHP assessment basis.\nFunding for the PPP, which was created by the CARES Act, was increased with the enactment of subsequent laws, most recently by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, on December 27, 2020. While some provisions of the CARES Act have expired, others have been extended by regulatory and legislative action. Additional phases of the CARES Act or other COVID-19 pandemic relief legislation may be enacted by Congress. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of such legislation on our business, including its continued impact to the U.S. economy, impacts to mortgages held or serviced by our members and that we accept as collateral, and the impacts on our MPF program.\nAs a result of the merger with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (Merger), we acquired certain offsetting interest rate swaps and classified these as economic derivatives.\nOur total advance par value decreased $34.1 billion or 43 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings of $25.5 billion by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as they paid off their remaining advance balances during 2020. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. had our largest concentration of advances outstanding at December 31, 2019. We do not expect significant new advances to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in the near future and this trend of paydowns and decreased new borrowings by members may continue. In 2020, we experienced decreased demand for advances across the majority of our other institution types, driven primarily by increased liquidity in the financial markets and higher member deposit levels.\nOur MD&A is organized as follows:\nInvestments\n3 Represents derivative transactions cleared with CME Clearing, our clearinghouse, who is not rated. CME Clearing's parent, CME Group Inc. was rated Aa3 by Moody's and AA-by Standard and Poor's at December 31, 2019.\nAs a result of the market volatility experienced during 2020 due in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Finance Agency extended the FHLBanks' authority to enter into LIBOR-based instruments that mature after December 31, 2021 from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020. In addition, the Finance Agency extended the requirement to update pledged collateral certification reporting requirements from March 31, 2020, to September 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, we ceased execution of new LIBOR indexed transactions with maturities beyond December 31, 2021.\nWe transact most of our derivative transactions with large banks and major broker-dealers. Over-the-counter derivative transactions may be either executed directly with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., a clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (cleared derivatives). We utilize one Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse), CME Clearing, for all cleared derivative transactions. CME Clearing notifies the clearing agent of the required initial margin and daily variation margin payments, and the clearing agent in turn notifies the Bank. The Clearinghouse determines initial margin requirements which are considered cash collateral. Variation margin requirements with CME Clearing are based on changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives and are legally characterized as daily settlement payments, which are a component of the derivative fair value, rather than cash collateral.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of our investments by credit rating (dollars in millions):\nWe categorize our financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level hierarchy. The hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs used to value the asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not carry any financial assets or liabilities, measured on a recurring basis, at fair value on our Statements of Condition based on unobservable inputs.\nOur total assets decreased to $87.7 billion at December 31, 2020, from $129.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Our total liabilities decreased to $82.0 billion at December 31, 2020, from $122.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Total capital decreased to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020, from $6.7 billion at December 31, 2019. See further discussion of changes in our financial condition in the sections that follow.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments and assumptions that affect our reported results and disclosures. Certain of our accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others to our financial results. Given the assumptions and judgment used, we have identified fair value measurements and derivatives and hedging activities as critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we are primarily liable for the portion of consolidated obligations that are issued on our behalf, we are also jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all consolidated obligations issued by the FHLBank System. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations for which we are primarily liable was $79.3 billion and $121.0 billion. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations issued on behalf of other FHLBanks for which we are jointly and severally liable was $667.5 billion and $904.9 billion.\n\nwill depend on the number of homeowners who partake in these programs in the months to come. In the second quarter of 2020, we also elected to apply the troubled debt restructuring (TDR) relief provided by the CARES Act on our conventional mortgage loan portfolio. For additional information on the CARES Act and activity, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio.\u201d\n\u2022 cash deposited with us; and\nThe following tables show our policy limits and base case and change from base case MVCS in dollars per share and percent change respectively, based on outstanding shares of capital stock, including shares classified as mandatorily redeemable, assuming instantaneous parallel changes in interest rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe following table categorizes the net effect of hedging activities on net income by product (dollars in millions):\nInformation security risk includes the risk that cyber incidents could result in a failure or interruption of our business operations. We have not experienced any such disruption with a material adverse impact. However, we do rely heavily on internal and third-party information systems and other technology to conduct and manage our business and any disruptions to those items could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We mitigate cybersecurity risk utilizing the concept of defense in depth, where multiple layers of security controls are implemented. Administrative, physical, and logical controls are in place for identifying, monitoring, and controlling system access, sensitive data, and system changes. In addition, we employ thorough security testing and training that includes regular third party facilitated penetration testing, as well as mandatory staff training on cyber risks. Given the importance of cybersecurity and ever-increasing sophistication of potential cyber-attacks, we have recently strengthened our cyber-defenses and expect to continue to do so.\n1 Represents either the lowest credit rating available for each investment based on an NRSRO, or the guarantor credit rating, if applicable. In instances where an NRSRO rating or guarantor rating is not available for the investment, the investment is classified as unrated.\nUnited States Department of Treasury (Treasury) and Fannie Mae Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment\n\n1 Represents either the lowest credit rating available for each counterparty based on an NRSRO, or the guarantor credit rating, if applicable. In instances where an NRSRO rating or guarantor rating is not available for the investment, the investment is classified as unrated.\nInvestments\nWe may issue debt, make advances, or purchase financial instruments in which a derivative instrument is embedded.\u201d Upon execution of these transactions, we assess whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the debt, advance, or purchased financial instrument (the host contract) and whether a separate, non-embedded instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. If we determine that the embedded derivative has economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract, carried at fair value, and designated as an economic derivative instrument. However, if we elect to carry the entire contract (the host contract and the embedded derivative) at fair value on the Statements of Condition, changes in fair value of the entire contract will be reported in current period earnings.\nOur capital decreased $1.0 billion or 15 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in capital stock resulting from a decline in member activity. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital\u201d for additional information on our capital.\nCapital\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThis rule may have an effect on member demand for certain advances, but we cannot predict the extent of the impact. To the extent this rule has a material impact on our advance demand, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOn December 27, 2020, the President signed into law an extension of the PPP until March 31, 2021. The April 23, 2020 Supervisory Letter from the Finance Agency allowing FHLBanks to accept PPP loans as collateral remains in effect.\nDuring 2020, we also received a partial recovery of a prior capital distribution from the Financing Corporation in the amount of approximately $26 million, which was credited to unrestricted retained earnings. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Capital.\u201d\nNet interest income totaled $472 million in 2020 compared to $576 million in 2019. Our net interest margin was 0.45 percent during 2020 compared to 0.42 percent during 2019. The $104 million decline in net interest income was primarily impacted by the lower interest rate environment and lower average advance balances, partially offset by an increase in advance prepayment fee income of $66 million compared to the same period in 2019.\nFor additional discussion on items impacting our GAAP earnings, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe do not believe these changes will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur liquidity and capital positions are actively managed in an effort to preserve stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds to meet current and projected future operating financial commitments, as well as regulatory, liquidity, and capital requirements.\n1 Prepayment fees on advances, net includes basis adjustment amortization and premium and/or discount amortization.\nBecause our business model is primarily one of holding assets and liabilities to maturity, management believes that the adjusted earnings measure is helpful in understanding our operating results and provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison of our economic performance in contrast to GAAP results, which can be impacted by fair value changes driven by market volatility on financial instruments recorded at fair value or transactions that are considered to be unpredictable or not routine. As a result, management uses the adjusted earnings measure to assess performance under our incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. While these non-GAAP measures can be used to assist in understanding the components of our earnings, they should not be considered a substitute for results reported under GAAP.\n\u2022using appropriate option valuation models and prepayment estimates or forecasts to describe the evolution of interest rates over time and the expected cash flows of financial instruments in response.\nWe monitor and manage projected 24-month income sensitivity in an effort to limit the short-term earnings volatility of the Bank. The projected 24-month income sensitivity is based on forward interest rates, which allows for negative rates beginning September 30, 2020, business, and risk management assumptions.\nWe continue to evaluate the potential impact of the Supervisory Letter and the related subsequent guidance on our financial condition and results of operations, but we may experience decreased flexibility in our access to funding, higher funding costs, or lower overall demand or increased costs for our advances; which may, in turn, negatively impact our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\n2 These conventional loans were required to have PMI at origination.\n\nOur hedging strategies include hedges of specific assets and liabilities that qualify for fair value hedge accounting and economic hedges that are used to reduce overall market risk exposure. All new hedging strategies are approved by our Asset-Liability Committee. See additional discussion regarding our derivative contracts in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities.\u201d\nAs the spread of COVID-19 increased and the economic impact continued to be negative, the Federal Reserve and Congress implemented a multitude of programs to help stabilize market conditions. The Federal Reserve indicated that it will continue to increase its holdings of U.S. Treasuries and agency MBS, until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.\nSOURCES OF LIQUIDITY\nThe prepayment options embedded in MBS can result in extensions or contractions in the expected maturities of these investments, depending on changes in and levels of interest rates, as well as other factors related to the mortgage market. The Finance Agency limits this source of interest rate risk by restricting the types of MBS we may own to those with limited average life changes under certain interest rate shock scenarios.\nWe offer a wide range of fixed and variable rate advance products with different maturities, interest rates, payment characteristics, and optionality. We may use derivatives to adjust the repricing and/or option characteristics of advances in an effort to manage interest rate risk. For example, we may hedge a fixed rate advance with an interest rate swap where we pay a fixed rate coupon and receive a variable rate coupon, effectively converting the fixed rate advance to a variable rate advance. This type of hedge is typically treated as a fair value hedge. In addition, we may hedge a callable advance, which gives the borrower the option to extinguish the fixed rate advance prior to maturity, by entering into a cancelable interest rate swap.\n\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nWe use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Finance Agency regulations and our risk management policies establish guidelines for derivatives, prohibit trading in or the speculative use of derivatives, and limit credit risk arising from derivatives.\nWe primarily invest in U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, and MBS, and classify them as either trading, AFS, or HTM. The interest rate and prepayment risk associated with these investment securities is managed through a combination of debt issuance and derivatives. We may fund investment securities with fixed rate long-term and callable consolidated obligations or utilize interest rate swaps, caps, floors, or swaptions to manage interest rate risk.\nThe following table categorizes the net effect of hedging activities on net income by product (dollars in millions):\n\nSecond, we are precluded by regulation from redeeming any capital stock without the prior approval of the Finance Agency if either our Board of Directors or the Finance Agency determines that we incurred or are likely to incur losses resulting in or likely to result in a charge against capital.\n4 Average balances reflect the impact of fair value hedging adjustments.\nAdvances\nAmortization/accretion varies from period to period depending on our hedge relationship termination activities and the maturity, call, or prepayment of assets or liabilities previously in hedge relationships. During 2020, we experienced increased amortization activity, primarily due to an increase in prepayments of advances and investments that were previously in a hedge relationship.\n1 Source: The Office of Finance.\nFDIC Brokered Deposits Restrictions\nOur current philosophy is to pay a membership capital stock dividend similar to a reference rate of interest, such as SOFR, and an activity-based capital stock dividend, when possible, at a level above the membership capital stock dividend. Prior to the second quarter of 2020 dividend, we used average three-month LIBOR as our reference rate. Beginning with the second quarter dividend, paid in the third quarter of 2020, we used SOFR as our reference rate.\n\nACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES\n1 Represents either the lowest credit rating available for each counterparty based on an NRSRO, or the guarantor credit rating, if applicable.\nIf we are liquidated, after payment in full to our creditors, our stockholders will be entitled to receive the par value of their capital stock as well as any retained earnings, in an amount proportional to the stockholder's share of the total shares of capital stock. In the event of a merger or consolidation, our Board of Directors shall determine the rights and preferences of our stockholders, subject to applicable Finance Agency regulations, as well as any terms and conditions imposed by the Finance Agency.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of our investments by credit rating (dollars in millions):\n\nNET INTEREST MARGIN\nOn September 27, 2019, the Finance Agency issued a Supervisory Letter to all FHLBanks providing LIBOR transition guidance. The Supervisory Letter stated that by March 31, 2020, the FHLBanks should no longer enter into new financial assets, liabilities, and derivatives that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021 for all product types other than investments. For investments, the Supervisory Letter indicated the FHLBanks, by December 31, 2019, should stop purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021. We ceased purchasing investments that reference LIBOR in 2018. As a result of market volatility triggered in part by COVID-19, on March 16, 2020, the Finance Agency extended from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020 the FHLBanks' ability to enter into new instruments referencing LIBOR that mature after December 31, 2021. As of June 30, 2020, we ceased execution of new LIBOR indexed transactions with maturities beyond December 31, 2021.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, 25 and 31 percent of our advances were variable rate callable advances. Callable advances may be prepaid by borrowers on pertinent dates (call dates) and therefore provide borrowers a source of long-term financing with prepayment flexibility. Interest rates on our variable rate callable advances reset at each call date to be consistent with either the underlying index or our current offering rate in line with our underlying cost of funds. We generally fund our variable rate callable advances with either discount notes or short-term floating rate debt. For additional discussion on our funding strategies, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity - Sources of Liquidity.\u201d\nFair Value Measurements\nFinance Agency Final Rule on FHLBank Housing Goals Amendments\nFinance Agency Final Rule on Stress Testing\nCORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT (CARES ACT)\nReplacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate\nOn April 23, 2020, the Finance Agency issued a Supervisory Letter (PPP Supervisory Letter) permitting the FHLBanks to accept PPP loans as collateral for advances as Agency Securities,\u201d given the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 100 percent guarantee of the unpaid principal balance. On April 20, 2020, the SBA published its third interim final rule related to PPP loans, which explicitly waived certain regulatory requirements that must be satisfied before a member could pledge PPP loans to the FHLBanks as collateral. The PPP Supervisory Letter establishes a series of conditions under which the FHLBanks may accept PPP loans as collateral, which conditions focus on the financial condition of members, collateral discounts, and pledge dollar limits.\nMarket Risk\nThe following table summarizes information on our bonds (dollars in millions):\n\n\u2022understanding the contractual and behavioral features of each instrument;\n\u2022Includes mortgage forbearance provisions and a foreclosure moratorium.\nFINANCE AGENCY SUPERVISORY LETTER - PPP LOANS AS COLLATERAL FOR FHLBANK ADVANCES\n1 Represents the lowest original FICO\u00ae score of the borrowers and co-borrowers.\nOn March 24, 2020, the Finance Agency published a final rule, effective upon issuance, to amend its stress testing rule, consistent with section 401 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (EGRRCPA). The final rule (i) raises the minimum threshold for entities regulated by the Finance Agency to conduct periodic stress tests from $10 billion to $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, (ii) removes the requirements for FHLBanks to conduct stress testing, and (iii) removes the adverse scenario from the list of required scenarios. FHLBanks are currently excluded from this regulation because no FHLBank has total consolidated assets over $250 billion, but the Finance Agency reserved its discretion to require an FHLBank with total consolidated assets below the $250 billion threshold to conduct stress testing. These amendments align the Finance Agency's stress testing rule with rules adopted by other financial institution regulators that implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) stress testing requirements, as amended by EGRRCPA.\nDuring 2020, we recorded other income (loss) of $121 million compared to $20 million during 2019. Other income (loss) was primarily impacted by net gains on litigation settlements of $120 million as a result of settlements with defendants in our private-label MBS litigation. As of December 31, 2020, all private-label litigation cases initially filed have been settled. We did not record any litigation settlements during 2019. Other factors impacting other income (loss) included net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities and net gains (losses) on trading securities, as described below.\n2 Represents secured securities purchased under agreements to resell with no NRSRO or guarantor rating.\nINTEREST RATE PAYMENT TERMS\nOur total liabilities decreased to $82.0 billion at December 31, 2020, from $122.9 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in the amount of consolidated obligations needed to fund our assets.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of our investments (dollars in millions):\nSTATEMENTS OF CONDITION\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n4 Represents amounts recorded in Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d on the Statements of Income.\n4 Adjusted AHP assessments for this non-GAAP measure are calculated as 10 percent of adjusted net income before assessments. For additional discussion on AHP assessments, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Affordable Housing Program.\u201d\nThe Finance Agency limits our investments in MBS by requiring that the balance of our MBS not exceed three times regulatory capital at the time of purchase. At December 31, 2020, our ratio of MBS to regulatory capital was 2.40 compared to 2.12 at December 31, 2019.\n\nThe federal government programs to assist homeowners affected by the pandemic, including temporary mortgage payment forbearance and a temporary moratorium on foreclosures and evictions, remained in place during the fourth quarter of 2020. Forbearances and delinquencies of mortgage loans stabilized and began to trend down in the second half of 2020, consistent with a decline in the rate of unemployment. The federal government programs are set to expire on June 30, 2021, which could result in an increase in delinquencies and foreclosures.\n8 Represents yield on total interest-earning assets minus cost of total interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nOur dividend rates seek to strike a balance between providing reasonable and consistent returns to members while preserving our financial position, flexibility, and ability to serve as a long-term liquidity provider. Our actual dividend is determined quarterly by our Board of Directors, based on policies, regulatory requirements, actual performance, and other considerations that the Board determines to be appropriate.\nOur total mortgage loans decreased $1.1 billion or 12 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to principal paydowns exceeding loan purchases as a result of increased refinancing activity driven by lower rates.\n\u2022fully disbursed whole first mortgages on improved residential real property or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages;\n\u2022Creates a loan program for small businesses, non-profits and physician practices that can be forgiven through employee retention incentives;\nThe following table summarizes information on our mortgage loans held for portfolio (dollars in millions):\n\nWe have risk management policies, established by our Board of Directors, that monitor and control our exposure to market, liquidity, credit, operational, model, information security, compliance, and strategic risk, as well as capital adequacy. Our primary risk management objective is to manage our assets and liabilities in ways that ensure liquidity is available to our members and protect the par redemption value of our capital stock. We periodically evaluate our risk management policies in order to respond to changes in our financial position and general market conditions.\nOn January 31, 2020, the Finance Agency released guidance on risk management of AMA. The guidance communicates the Finance Agency's expectations with respect to an FHLBank's funding of its members through the purchase of eligible mortgage loans and includes expectations that an FHLBank will have board-established limits on AMA portfolios and management-established thresholds to serve as monitoring tools to manage AMA-related risk exposure. The guidance provides that the board of an FHLBank should ensure that the bank serves as a liquidity source for members, and an FHLBank should ensure that its portfolio limits do not result in the FHLBank's acquisition of mortgages from smaller members being crowded out\u201d by the acquisition of mortgages from larger members. The advisory bulletin contains the expectation that the board of an FHLBank should set limits on the size and growth of portfolios and on acquisitions from a single participating financial institution. In addition, the guidance provides that the board of an FHLBank should consider concentration risk in the areas of geographic area, high-balance loans, and in third-party loan originations.\nAn economic hedge is defined as a derivative hedging specific or non-specific underlying assets, liabilities, or firm commitments that does not qualify or was not designated for fair value hedge accounting, but is an acceptable hedging strategy under our risk management program. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as economic hedges are recorded in other income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d with no offsetting fair value adjustments for the underlying assets, liabilities, or firm commitments, unless changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities are normally marked to fair value through earnings (e.g., trading securities and fair value option instruments).\n2 Effective combined annualized dividend rate is paid on total capital stock, including mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\nDiscount Notes\n3 Represents gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items in qualifying hedging relationships. Amounts do not include the amortization of the financing element of off-market derivatives.\nINVESTMENTS\n\u2022Decreased shares of capital stock: Our capital stock balance decreased at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019 due primarily to a decrease in member activity. As we repurchased this capital stock at par, which is below our current MVCS value, our MVCS was positively impacted.\nRefer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities\u201d for additional discussion on our derivatives.\nWe evaluate advances for credit losses on a quarterly basis. We adopted new accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2020. We have never experienced a credit loss on our advances. Based upon our collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on advances, management has determined that there were no expected credit losses on our advances as of December 31, 2020. For the same reasons, we did not record any allowance for credit losses for our advances at December 31, 2019. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 - Advances\u201d for additional information.\nThe following table reflects our funding spreads to U.S. Treasuries (basis points)1:\nThe net settlements of interest receivables and payables related to derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized as adjustments to the interest income or interest expense of the designated hedged item. The net settlements of interest receivables and payables related to derivatives designated as economic hedges are recognized in other income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d\nUnder a blanket pledge agreement, we are granted a security interest in all financial assets of the borrower to fully secure the borrower's obligation. Other than securities and cash deposits, we do not initially take delivery of collateral from blanket agreement borrowers. In the event of a default or a deterioration in the financial condition of a blanket pledge agreement borrower, we have the ability to require delivery of pledged collateral sufficient to secure the borrower's obligation. With respect to non-blanket pledge agreement borrowers that are federally insured, we generally require collateral to be specifically assigned. With respect to non-blanket pledge agreement borrowers that are not federally insured (typically insurance companies, CDFIs, and housing associates), we generally take control of collateral through the delivery of cash, securities, or loans to us or our custodians.\n\n\nOur short-term portfolio may include, but is not limited to, interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury obligations. Our long-term portfolio may include, but is not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, taxable municipal bonds, and MBS. We consider our long-term investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, or the FDIC to be of the highest credit quality and therefore those exposures are not monitored with other unsecured investments. Given the credit quality of our unsecured long-term investments, our unsecured credit risk is primarily in the short-term portfolio.\nThe following table summarizes our advances by type of institution (dollars in millions):\nThe contractual or notional amount of derivatives reflects our involvement in the various classes of financial instruments. Our maximum credit risk is the estimated cost of replacing derivatives if there is a default, minus the value of any related collateral. In determining maximum credit risk, we consider accrued interest receivables and payables as well as our ability to net settle positive and negative positions with the same counterparty and/or clearing agent when netting requirements are met.\n\nBonds\nWe invest in fixed rate mortgage loans and certain mortgage loan purchase commitments with our PFIs that are considered derivatives. We normally hedge these commitments by selling TBA MBS for forward settlement. A TBA represents a forward contract for the sale of MBS at a future agreed upon date for an established price. Upon expiration of the mortgage loan purchase commitment, we purchase the TBA to close the hedged position.\n\n\nINTEREST RATE PAYMENT TERMS\nDIVIDENDS\nWe discontinue fair value hedge accounting prospectively when either (i) we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of a hedged item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate, (ii) the derivative and/or the hedged item expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or (iii) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.\n\u2022Long-haul hedge accounting. The application of long-haul hedge accounting requires us to formally assess (both at the hedge's inception and at least quarterly) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items due to benchmark interest rate changes and whether those derivatives are expected to remain highly effective in future periods. The Bank uses regression analyses to assess the effectiveness of its long-haul hedges.\nBorrowers may pledge collateral to us by executing a blanket pledge agreement, specifically assigning collateral, or placing physical possession of collateral with us or our custodians. We perfect our security interest in all pledged collateral by filing Uniform Commercial Code financing statements or by taking possession or control of the collateral. Under the FHLBank Act, any security interest granted to us by our members, or any affiliates of our members, has priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor), unless those claims and rights would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual purchasers or by parties that have perfected security interests.\n2 Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items in qualifying fair value hedge relationships are reported in net interest income. Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items also includes the amortization of the financing element of off-market derivatives.\nThe following table shows our change from base 24-month projected ROACS for index specific shocks based on a two standard deviation of historical monthly changes in spread and associated policy limits at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nWe are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. First, the FHLBank Act requires that we maintain at all times permanent capital greater than or equal to the sum of our credit, market, and operations risk capital requirements, all calculated in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. Only permanent capital, defined as Class B capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock), and retained earnings can satisfy this risk-based capital requirement. Second, the FHLBank Act requires a minimum four percent capital-to-asset ratio, which is defined as total regulatory capital divided by total assets. Total regulatory capital includes all Class B capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) and retained earnings. It does not include accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). Third, the FHLBank Act imposes a five percent minimum leverage ratio, which is defined as the sum of permanent capital weighted 1.5 times and nonpermanent capital weighted 1.0 times, divided by total assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not hold any nonpermanent capital. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with all three of the Finance Agency's regulatory capital requirements.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our mandatorily redeemable capital stock totaled $52 million and $206 million. Our total mandatorily redeemable capital stock balance decreased $154 million at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019 due primarily to the repurchase of capital stock outstanding to captive insurance company members during 2020, driven by repayment of their advance balances.\nIf a hedging activity does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (economic hedge), the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables related to the derivative as well as the fair value gains and losses on the derivative are recorded as a component of other income (loss) in Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities;\u201d however, there is no fair value adjustment for the corresponding asset or liability being hedged unless changes in the fair value of the asset or liability are normally marked to fair value through earnings (i.e., trading securities and fair value option instruments).\nCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nWe record trading securities, AFS securities, derivative assets and liabilities, and certain other assets at fair value on our Statements of Condition on a recurring basis and on occasion, certain impaired mortgage loans held for portfolio on a non-recurring basis. Fair value is a market-based measurement and is defined as the price received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. In general, the transaction price will equal the exit price and, therefore, represent the fair value of the asset or liability at initial recognition. In determining whether a transaction price represents the fair value of the asset or liability at initial recognition, we are required to consider factors specific to the asset or liability, the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, and market participants with whom we would transact in that market.\nCONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS\nThe effects of COVID-19 are rapidly evolving, and the full impact and duration of the virus are unknown. As a result of measures taken to address the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown, interest rates have declined significantly and our financial statements have been adversely impacted. Further, demand for advances decreased significantly as a number of emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve helped facilitate liquidity and support stability in the fixed-income markets and as members experienced substantial deposit growth. The extent of the impact to our future performance will depend upon how long the current conditions persist. For additional information, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Conditions in the Financial Markets - Economy and Financial Markets\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDERIVATIVES\nIf hedging relationships meet certain criteria, including, but not limited to, formal documentation of the fair value hedging relationship and an expectation to be highly effective, they qualify for fair value hedge accounting. At the inception of each fair value hedge transaction, we formally document the hedge relationship and our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value attributable to the hedged risk will be assessed. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to assets and liabilities on the Statements of Condition and firm commitments.\n2 Table excludes investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, or the FDIC.\n\nOther expense totaled $189 million for 2020 compared to $168 million for 2019. The increase in other expense was primarily due to increased pension costs as a result of us making a discretionary contribution of $32 million at the end of the year, offset in part by lower professional fees and other operating expenses.\n\nWe reclassify capital stock subject to redemption from equity to a liability (mandatorily redeemable capital stock) at the time shares meet the definition of a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument. This occurs after a member provides written notice of redemption, gives notice of intention to withdraw from membership, becomes ineligible for continuing membership, or attains non-member status by merger or consolidation, charter termination, or other involuntary termination from membership.\nDERIVATIVES\nAs indicated in the tables that follow, our adjusted net interest income and adjusted net income decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019. The decline was driven by lower adjusted net interest income due primarily to lower average advance balances and the lower interest rate environment.\nThe following tables summarize our variable rate advances, investments, consolidated obligation bonds and derivatives by interest-rate index at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\nThe notional amount of our derivative contracts decreased at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by advance prepayments and a reduction in overall assets and liabilities. Consistent with the move to an alternative benchmark rate other than LIBOR, we started using interest rate swaps based on the federal funds or SOFR OIS rates to hedge our balance sheet during 2020. For additional discussion regarding our use of derivatives, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Derivatives.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuring 2020, we recorded net losses of $48 million on our derivatives and hedging activities compared to net losses of $35 million in 2019. The fair value changes were primarily driven by changes in interest rates which impacted the fair value of interest rate swaps used to economically hedge our investment securities portfolio. These changes were primarily driven by market volatility caused by COVID-19 and the impact it had on interest rates. Accounting rules require all derivatives to be recorded at fair value and therefore we may be subject to income statement volatility. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Hedging Activities\u201d for additional discussion on our derivatives and hedging activities.\nIn light of recent market volatility stemming from COVID-19, we are taking additional steps to monitor our credit risk on investments. These steps include temporarily suspending business to Bank counterparties with increased credit risk and performing additional analysis on our unsecured portfolios. In addition, we continue to monitor market volatility and counterparty ratings, counterparty pricing, news, sovereign and counterparty research, market research and articles, and other COVID-19 analysis.\n\nOur investments decreased $7.0 billion or 18 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in money market investments of $9.7 billion, as liquidity management was impacted by lower advance demand and other economic impacts of COVID-19.\nEligible collateral includes:\n5 Other investments primarily include U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, taxable municipal bonds, and Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO) bonds.\nWe define information security risk as the risk arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information or information systems. Importantly, this definition includes the security of both digital and non-digital information as well as associated information systems and processes.\nEconomy and Financial Markets\nFunding Spreads\n\u2022Federal funds sold. Unsecured loans of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Banks between financial institutions.\n\nOffsetting Positions\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table shows our 24-month projected ROACS spread to the average projected reference rate and associated policy limits, assuming instantaneous non-parallel shifts in interest rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe following table shows the components of other expense (dollars in millions):\nInvestments\nInterest expense on discount notes decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to the lower interest rate environment and lower average discount note balances driven by a decrease in the amount of consolidated obligations needed to fund our assets. Interest expense on discount notes increased during 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily due to the to the higher interest rate environment on average, partially offset by lower average discount note balances driven by a reduction in total assets.\nIn 2020, we reported net income of $362 million compared to $384 million in 2019. Our net income, calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was driven by net interest income, other income (loss), and other expense.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n", "item_7_text": "6 The hedging activity tables do not include the interest component on the related hedged items or the gross prepayment fee income on terminated advance or investment hedge relationships.\n\nWe are subject to certain liquidity requirements set forth by the Finance Agency, as further outlined below. We also maintain a liquidity contingency funding plan designed to enable us to meet our obligations and the liquidity needs of our members in the event of short-term capital market disruptions, or operational disruptions at our Bank and/or the Office of Finance.\nWe are focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between our financial assets and financial liabilities and work collectively with the other FHLBanks to manage the system-wide liquidity and funding needs. We monitor our debt refinancing risk and liquidity position primarily by tracking the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, we consider contractual maturities of our financial assets and liabilities, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments). External factors, including member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may affect liquidity balances and the funding balances between financial assets and financial liabilities. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements\u201d for additional information regarding the contractual maturities or redemption terms of certain of our financial assets and liabilities.\nOn January 22, 2021, the FDIC published a final rule, effective April 1, 2021, that amends its brokered deposits regulations that apply to less than well-capitalized insured depository institutions. The FDIC stated that the amendments are intended to modernize and clarify the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations and they establish a new framework for analyzing the deposit broker definition, which determines whether deposits placed through deposit placement arrangements qualify as brokered deposits. These deposit placement arrangements include those between insured depository institutions and third parties, such as financial technology companies, for a variety of business purposes, including access to deposits. The amendments to the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations, among other things, clarify what it means to be engaged in the business of facilitating the placement of deposits and expand the scope of the primary purpose exception. The rule amendments are expected to have the effect of narrowing the definition of deposit broker and excluding more deposits from treatment as brokered deposits. The amendments also establish an application and reporting process with respect to the primary purpose exception for businesses that do not meet one of several bright-line tests, and they affirm the FDIC's position that the brokering of certificates of deposit constitutes deposit brokering.\n\nLiquidity Reserves for Deposits - We are required to have available at all times an amount greater than or equal to members' current deposits invested in advances with maturities not to exceed five years, deposits in banks or trust companies, and obligations of the U.S. Treasury. The following table shows our compliance with this requirement (dollars in billions):\nOur total assets decreased to $87.7 billion at December 31, 2020, from $129.6 billion at December 31, 2019 driven by a decrease in advances and investments. Advances at December 31, 2020 decreased by $33.8 billion from advances at December 31, 2019 due primarily to a decrease in borrowings of $25.5 billion by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. We experienced decreased demand for advances across the majority of our other institution types, driven primarily by increased liquidity in the financial markets and higher member deposit levels. Investments decreased $7.0 billion from December 31, 2019 due primarily to a decline in money market investments of $9.7 billion, as liquidity management was impacted by lower advance demand and other economic impacts of COVID-19.\n2 Represents secured securities purchased under agreements to resell with no NRSRO or guarantor rating.\nThe following table summarizes the reconciliation between GAAP net income before assessments and adjusted net income (dollars in millions):\nOn October 21, 2020, the Finance Agency issued a Supervisory Letter to the FHLBanks that required each FHLBank to adhere to the Protocol by December 31, 2020, and to the extent necessary, to amend any bilateral agreements regarding the adoption of the Protocol by December 15, 2020.\nFirst, in no case may we redeem any capital stock if, following such redemption, we would fail to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital requirements. By law, all member holdings of our capital stock immediately become nonredeemable if we become undercapitalized.\nRefer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio\u201d for additional information on our allowance for credit losses and the payment status of our conventional mortgage loans.\nWe may enter into derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our consolidated obligations. For example, we may issue and hedge a fixed rate consolidated obligation with an interest rate swap where we receive a fixed rate coupon and pay a variable rate coupon, effectively converting the fixed rate consolidated obligation to a variable rate consolidated obligation. This type of hedge is typically treated as a fair value hedge. We may also issue variable interest rate consolidated obligations and simultaneously execute interest rate swaps to hedge the basis risk of the variable interest rate debt. Interest rate swaps used to hedge variable interest rate debt do not qualify for hedge accounting and as a result, this type of hedge is treated as an economic hedge.\nWe define liquidity risk as the risk that we will be unable to meet our financial obligations as they come due or meet the credit needs of our members in a timely and cost efficient manner. To manage this risk, we maintain liquidity in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. For additional information on compliance with these requirements, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity - Liquidity Requirements.\u201d\nWe use sophisticated risk management systems to evaluate our financial position and risk exposure. These systems employ various mathematical models and valuation techniques to measure interest rate risk and credit risk. For example, we use valuation techniques designed to model explicit and embedded options and other cash flow uncertainties across a number of hypothetical interest rate environments. The techniques used to model options rely on:\nThe following tables show our policy limits and base case and change from base case MVCS in dollars per share and percent change respectively, based on outstanding shares of capital stock, including shares classified as mandatorily redeemable, assuming instantaneous non-parallel changes in interest rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe following table shows the five largest state concentrations of our conventional MPP portfolio. All percentages are calculated based on unpaid principal balances as of the applicable period end.\nWe adhered to the Protocol on October 22, 2020, and all of our counterparties have adhered to the Protocol. For a discussion of the potential impact of the LIBOR transition, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOur discount notes decreased $2.2 billion or seven percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in total assets.\nOn June 25, 2020, the Finance Agency published a final rule, effective August 24, 2020, amending the FHLBank housing goals regulation. Enforcement of the final rule will phase in over three years. The final rule replaces the four existing retrospective housing goals with a single prospective mortgage purchase housing goal target in which 20 percent of Acquired Member Asset (AMA) mortgages purchased in a year must be comprised of loans to low-income or very low-income families, or to families in low-income areas. The final rule also establishes a separate small member participation housing goal with a target level in which 50 percent of the members selling acquired member asset (AMA) loans in a calendar year must be small members. The final rule provides that an FHLBank may request Finance Agency approval of alternative target levels for either or both of the goals. The final rule also establishes that housing goals apply to each FHLBank that acquires any AMA mortgages during a year, eliminating the existing $2.5 billion volume threshold that previously triggered the application of housing goals for each FHLBank.\n\n\u2022using appropriate market data, such as yield curves and implied volatilities; and\nWe execute most of our derivative transactions with large banks and major broker-dealers. Over-the-counter derivative transactions may be either executed directly with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent), with a Derivative Clearing Organization (cleared derivatives).\nOn November 30, 2020, U.S. and UK regulators and LIBOR's administrator made a series of announcements regarding the end of LIBOR. Collectively, these announcements proposed a prolonged wind-down for use of LIBOR. They call for no new LIBOR contracts after the end of 2021, while giving legacy contracts sufficient time to wind-down. If adopted, these proposed plans would cease the major LIBOR tenors in mid-2023 (overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month), and two less used LIBOR settings at the end of 2021 (1 week, 2-month).\n\u2022Direct payments to eligible taxpayers and their families;\n2 Represents the future funding contribution for our qualified defined benefit multiemployer plan and the scheduled benefit payments for our nonqualified defined benefit plans.\nFor a summary of our risks on the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nAll derivatives are recognized on the Statements of Condition at their fair values and reported as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities, net of cash collateral and accrued interest received from or pledged to clearing agents and/or counterparties. The fair values of derivatives are netted by clearing agent and/or counterparty when the netting requirements have been met. If these netted amounts result in a receivable to the Bank, they are classified as a derivative asset and, if classified as a payable to the clearing agent or counterparty, they are classified as a derivative liability. Cash flows associated with derivatives are reflected as cash flows from operating activities on the Statements of Cash Flows unless the derivative meets the criteria to be a financing derivative.\nRegulatory Capital Stock\nNET AMORTIZATION/ACCRETION\nFair value hedging adjustments changed $271 million at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019 due to the impact of interest rates on our cumulative fair value adjustments on advances in hedge relationships.\n\u2022Assistance to business, states, and municipalities;\nUnder the JCE Agreement, we are required to allocate 20 percent of our quarterly net income to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the balance of that account, calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter, equals at least one percent of our average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the calendar quarter. The restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately on our Statements of Condition. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our restricted retained earnings account totaled $576 million and $504 million. One percent of our average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was $810 million.\nWe define operational risk as the risk arising from inadequate or failed processes, people, and/or systems, including those emanating from external sources. All of our activities and processes generate operational risk, including legal risk. Management has established policies, procedures, and controls to reduce the likelihood of operational risk. We perform annual risk assessments to identify, assess, mitigate, and report on operational risks outside of the Board's risk appetite. Due to the manual nature of many of our processes, our operational risk exposure is closely monitored.\nOur primary source of liquidity is proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations (bonds and discount notes) in the capital markets. During 2020, proceeds from the issuance of bonds and discount notes were $42.5 billion and $178.9 billion compared to $66.7 billion and $121.2 billion in 2019. We continued to focus on issuing shorter-term discount notes in an effort to capture attractive funding, match repricing structures on advances, and provide additional liquidity.\nWe define compliance risk as the risk of violations of laws, rules, regulations, regulatory and supervisory guidance, and internal policies and procedures. Our Legal and Compliance departments are responsible for coordinating with our various business units in connection with its identification, evaluation, and mitigation of our compliance risks.\n4 Represents mortgage loan purchase commitments with our member institutions.\nAdjusted Earnings\nDISCOUNT NOTES\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nCFIs may also pledge collateral consisting of secured small business, small agri-business, or small farm loans. As additional security, the FHLBank Act provides that we have a lien on each borrower's capital stock investment; however, capital stock cannot be pledged as collateral to secure credit exposures.\nWe evaluate investments for credit losses on a quarterly basis. For additional discussion on our investment credit risk. refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Credit Risk - Investments.\u201d\nAs part of evaluating our financial performance, we adjust GAAP net interest income and GAAP net income before assessments for the impact of (i) market adjustments relating to derivative and hedging activities and instruments held at fair value, (ii) realized gains (losses) on investment securities, and (iii) other non-routine and unpredictable items, including, but not limited to, net asset prepayment fee income, mandatorily redeemable capital stock interest expense, discretionary pension contributions, and net gains on litigation settlements. The resulting non-GAAP measure, referred to as our adjusted earnings, reflects both adjusted net interest income and adjusted net income.\nAs a result of recent stressed market conditions stemming from COVID-19, we are taking additional steps to monitor our credit risk on advances. These steps include increased frequency of collateral valuation and identifying, analyzing, and monitoring borrowers with higher risk profiles.\n\u2022Short-cut hedge accounting. Transactions that meet certain criteria qualify for short-cut hedge accounting in which an assumption can be made that the change in fair value of a hedged item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate exactly offsets the change in fair value of the related derivative. Under the short-cut method, the entire change in fair value of the interest rate swap is considered to be highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability. If documented at the time of hedge designation, a derivative relationship no longer qualifying for short-cut hedge accounting can fallback to the long-haul accounting method.\n3 Represents the interest component on derivatives that qualify for fair value hedge accounting.\nInterest Rates\n\nInformation Security Risk\nThe net gains and losses on derivatives and hedged items are recorded in net interest income. Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items are primarily driven by changes in the benchmark interest rate, volatility, and the divergence in the valuation curves used to value our assets, liabilities, and derivatives. During 2020, we recorded gains of $17 million on our fair value hedge relationships compared to gains of $9 million in 2019, which stemmed from market volatility caused by COVID-19 and the impact it had on interest rates.\nMortgage Loans\nCapital\nNet Interest Income\nOur policy limits are based on 24-month projected ROACS spread to the average projected reference rate declines from base spread for the up and down 100 and 200 basis points parallel interest rate change scenarios as well as the up and down 100 basis points non-parallel interest rate change scenarios. Additionally, there is a limit on the decline from base ROACS for certain basis shock scenarios to limit basis risk exposure. Any policy limit breach requires a prompt action to address the measure outside of the policy limit.\n6 The hedging activity tables do not include the interest component on the related hedged items or the gross prepayment fee income on terminated advance or investment hedge relationships.\nCAPITAL STOCK\nNET INTEREST SETTLEMENTS\nThe MVCS calculation uses market prices which are computed using interest rates, which allows for negative rates beginning September 30, 2020, spreads, and volatilities, and assumes a run-off balance sheet. The timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are calculated by an internal model. To ensure the accuracy of the MVCS calculation, we reconcile the computed market prices of complex instruments, such as derivatives and mortgage assets, to market observed prices or dealers' quotes.\nWe are exposed to mortgage asset credit risk through our investments in MBS. Mortgage asset credit risk is the risk that we will not receive timely payments of principal and interest due from mortgage borrowers because of borrower defaults. Credit risk on mortgage assets is affected by a number of factors, including the strength and ability to guarantee the payments from the agency that created the structure, underlying loan performance, and other economic factors in the local market or nationwide. We limit our purchases of MBS to those guaranteed by the U.S. Government or issued by a GSE. Our risk management policies prohibit new purchases of private-label MBS. We perform ongoing analysis on these investments to determine potential credit issues.\nIn addition to the requirements previously discussed, during 2019, the Finance Agency finalized an Advisory Bulletin on capital stock (the Capital Stock AB) which required each FHLBank to maintain at all times a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets, effective February 2020. For purposes of the Capital Stock AB, capital stock includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The capital stock to total assets ratio is measured on a daily average basis at month end. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the Capital Stock AB. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Capital\u201d for additional information on our capital requirements.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio primarily to provide investment income and liquidity. Our primary credit risk on investments is the counterparties' ability to meet repayment terms. We mitigate this credit risk by purchasing investment quality securities. We define investment quality as a security with adequate financial backings so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security. We consider a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, including collateral performance, marketability, asset class or sector considerations, local and regional economic conditions, NRSRO credit ratings, and/or the financial health of the underlying issuer.\nCleared Derivatives. For cleared derivatives, the Clearinghouse is our counterparty. We are subject to risk of nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that we post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes us to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. However, the use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral/payments is posted daily, through a clearing agent, for changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives. We do not anticipate any credit losses on our cleared derivatives.\n1 Excludes $1.5 billion of advances with North American Company for Life and Health Insurance, an affiliate of Midland National Life Insurance Company.\nWe consider an advance past due for financial reporting purposes if a default of contractual principal or interest exists for a period of 30 days or more. In light of the above event, as of February 28, 2021, we have advances outstanding with a par value of $365 million that are considered past due. For additional discussion on our advance credit risk, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Credit Risk - Advances.\u201d\nLIBOR TRANSITION - ISDA 2020 IBOR FALLBACKS PROTOCOL AND SUPPLEMENT TO THE 2006 ISDA DEFINITIONS\nOn September 27, 2019, the Finance Agency issued a Supervisory Letter to the FHLBanks that the Finance Agency stated is designed to ensure the FHLBanks will be able to identify and prudently manage the risks associated with the termination of LIBOR in a safe and sound manner. The Supervisory Letter provided that the FHLBanks should, by March 31, 2020, cease entering into new LIBOR referenced financial assets, liabilities, and derivatives with maturities beyond December 31, 2021 for all product types except investments. With respect to investments, the FHLBanks were required, by December 31, 2019, to stop purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021. These phase-out dates did not apply to collateral accepted by the FHLBanks. The Supervisory Letter also directed the FHLBanks to update their pledged collateral certification reporting requirements by March 31, 2020, in an effort to encourage members to distinguish LIBOR-linked collateral maturing after December 31, 2021. The FHLBanks were expected to cease entering into LIBOR-indexed financial instruments maturing after December 31, 2021, by the deadlines specified in the Supervisory Letter, subject to limited exceptions granted by the Finance Agency for LIBOR-linked products serving compelling mission, risk mitigating, and/or hedging purposes that do not currently have readily available alternatives. We ceased purchasing investments that reference LIBOR in 2018.\n1 The amount at December 31, 2020 was less than $1 million.\n\nThe following table shows conventional MPF and MPP loans by FICO\u00ae score. All percentages are calculated based on unpaid principal balances as of the applicable period end.\nOur net interest income is impacted by changes in average interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability balances, and the related yields and costs. The following table presents average balances and yields/costs of major asset and liability categories (dollars in millions):\n1 Includes aggregate cash dividends paid during the period. Amount excludes cash dividends paid on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. For financial reporting purposes, these dividends were recorded as interest expense on our Statements of Income.\n\nWe were in compliance with the projected 24-month income sensitivity policy limits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nDerivatives are typically executed at the same time as the hedged item, and we designate the hedged item in a fair value hedge relationship at the trade date. In many hedging relationships, we may designate the fair value hedging relationship upon our commitment to disburse an advance or trade a consolidated obligation in which settlement occurs within the shortest period of time possible for the type of instrument based on market settlement conventions. We then record the changes in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item beginning on the trade date.\nWe are required by regulation to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure our advances, standby letters of credit, and other extensions of credit to borrowers (collectively, credit products). The estimated value of the collateral required to secure each borrower's credit products is calculated by applying collateral discounts, or haircuts, to the unpaid principal or market value, as applicable, of the collateral. We also have policies and procedures for validating the reasonableness of our collateral valuations. In addition, we perform collateral verifications and on-site reviews based on the risk profile of the borrower. Management believes that these policies effectively manage our credit risk from advances.\n\u2022Step-Up Bonds. These bonds pay interest at increasing fixed rates for specified intervals over the life of the bond. These bonds generally contain provisions enabling us to call the bonds at our option on the step-up dates.\nRETAINED EARNINGS\nDerivative Designations. Derivative instruments are designated by the Bank as:\nWe manage our credit exposure to advances through an approach that provides for an established credit limit for each borrower, ongoing reviews of each borrower's financial condition, and detailed collateral and lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers' needs for a reliable source of funding. In addition, we lend to our borrowers in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and other applicable laws.\n\u2022Commercial paper. Unsecured debt issued by corporations, typically for the financing of accounts receivable, inventories, and meeting short-term liabilities.\nBONDS\n\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nAdvances\nNET INTEREST SPREAD\nStrategic Risk\n1 Represents the amortization/accretion of basis adjustments on closed hedge relationships.\nThe following table shows our derivative counterparty credit exposure (dollars in millions):\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is designed to provide information that will help the reader develop a better understanding of our financial statements, changes in our financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors driving those changes. Unless expressly stated otherwise, the comparisons presented in this MD&A refer to the year-over-year comparison of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Discussion of 2018 items and the year-over-year comparison of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2020.\nThe capital stock requirements established in our Capital Plan are designed so that we can remain adequately capitalized as member activity changes. Our Board of Directors may make adjustments to the capital stock requirements within ranges established in our Capital Plan.\nThe following table summarizes our interest rate exchange agreements by type of hedged item, hedging instrument, associated hedging strategy, hedge accounting designation, and notional amount as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):\nBonds are issued with fixed or variable rate payment terms that use a variety of indices for interest rate resets such as SOFR or LIBOR. With respect to interest payments, fixed rate bonds may also have the following terms:\nThe following table categorizes the notional amount of our derivatives by type (dollars in millions):\nNet interest margin equals net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. During 2020, our net interest margin was 0.45 percent compared to 0.42 percent and 0.43 percent for the same periods in 2019 and 2018. The increase in net interest margin during 2020 when compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to higher asset-liability spreads, offset in part by the lower interest rate environment.\nAs a result of our credit quality and GSE status, we generally have ready access to funding at relatively competitive interest rates. During 2020, our short-term funding spreads to LIBOR, on average, were generally more favorable when compared to 2019. As such, we utilized short-term discount notes in an effort to capture attractive funding, match the repricing structures on floating rate assets, and meet our liquidity requirements. During 2020, our long-term funding spreads to LIBOR, on average, generally deteriorated when compared to 2019. Our funding spreads were mixed relative to U.S. Treasuries when compared to the same periods in the prior year.\nModel Risk\nFinance Agency regulations limit the type of investments we may purchase. We are prohibited from investing in financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks, unless otherwise approved by the Finance Agency. Our unsecured credit exposures to U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks include the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, the counterparty may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Our unsecured credit exposures to domestic counterparties and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign commercial banks include the risk that these counterparties have extended credit to foreign counterparties. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the above regulation and did not own any financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities, other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks, and those approved by the Finance Agency.\n1 Represents either the lowest credit rating available for each counterparty based on an NRSRO, or the guarantor credit rating, if applicable.\nWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect and misused model outputs. Throughout the course of our day-to-day activities, we utilize external and internal pricing and financial models as important inputs into business and risk management decision-making processes.\nConsolidated Obligations\n\nADDITIONAL COVID-19 PRESIDENTIAL, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\nMortgage Loans\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (loss) (dollars in millions):\nAt December 31, 2020, our unsecured short-term investment exposure consisted of overnight interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold. The following table presents our unsecured short-term investment exposure by counterparty credit rating and domicile at December 31, 2020 (excluding accrued interest receivable) (dollars in millions):\nA member may cancel any pending notice of redemption before the completion of the five-year redemption period by providing a written notice of cancellation. We charge a cancellation fee equal to a percentage of the par value of the shares of capital stock subject to redemption. This fee is currently set at a range of one to five percent depending on when we receive notice of cancellation from the member. Our Board of Directors retains the right to change the cancellation fee at any time. We will provide at least 15 days' written notice to each member of any adjustment or amendment to our cancellation fee.\nWe define strategic risk as the risk arising from adverse strategic business decisions, poor implementation and/or execution of strategic plans, or a disproportionate response to changes in the industry and operating environment. We consider legislative and reputational risks to be components of strategic risk. From time to time, proposals are made, or legislative and regulatory changes are considered, which could affect our cost of doing business or other aspects of our business. We mitigate strategic risk through strategic business planning and monitoring of our external and internal environment. For additional information on some of the more important risks we face, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOur capital stock has a par value of $100 per share, and all shares are issued, redeemed, and repurchased only at the stated par value. We generally issue a single class of capital stock (Class B stock) and have two subclasses of Class B capital stock: membership and activity-based. Each member must purchase and hold membership capital stock in an amount equal to 0.12 percent of its total assets as of the preceding December 31st, subject to a cap of $10 million and a floor of $10,000. Each member is also required to purchase activity-based capital stock equal to 4.00 percent of its advances and mortgage loans outstanding. Effective October 1, 2020, we required each member to purchase and hold activity-based stock in an amount equal to 0.10 percent of its standby letters of credit. This requirement applies to any new, renewed or modified standby letters of credit issued on or after October 1, 2020. All Class B capital stock issued is subject to a notice of redemption period of five years.\n\u2022other real estate-related collateral acceptable to us, such as second lien mortgages, home equity lines of credit, tax-exempt municipal securities, and commercial real estate mortgages, provided such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and we can perfect a security interest in it.\n1 Includes the notional amount of interest rate swaps in fair value hedge relationships for forward starting advance firm commitments of $252 million and $522 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThe COVID-19 outbreak continues to cause tremendous human and economic hardship across the U.S. Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of 2020. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\n\nOn October 23, 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA), published a Supplement to the 2006 ISDA Definitions (Supplement) and the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (Protocol). Both the Supplement and the Protocol took effect on January 25, 2021. On that date, all legacy bilateral derivative transactions subject to Protocol-covered agreements (including ISDA agreements) that incorporate certain covered ISDA definitional booklets and reference a covered Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR), including LIBOR, were effectively amended to apply the new ISDA-recommended IBOR fallbacks in the event of the relevant IBOR's cessation. Both the Bank and our counterparty must have adhered to the Protocol in order to effectively amend legacy derivatives contracts, otherwise the parties must bilaterally amend legacy covered agreements (including ISDA agreements) to address LIBOR fallbacks. The Protocol will remain open for adherence after the effective date. As of January 25, 2021, all new derivative contracts are subject to the relevant IBOR fallbacks set forth in the Supplement.\nWe utilize several sources of liquidity to carry out our business activities. These include, but are not limited to, proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations, payments collected on advances and mortgage loans, proceeds from investment securities, member deposits, the issuance of capital stock, and current period earnings.\nWe also temporarily expanded our Community Investment Advance (CIA) product and allowed Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) eligible members to demonstrate CIA program qualifications using PPP loans. This temporary expansion expired on December 31, 2020. In addition, we have made collateral policy changes and clarifications including accepting PPP loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as eligible collateral.\nThe following table summarizes information on our capital (dollars in millions):\n5 Represents the net gains (losses) on those trading securities in which we have entered into a corresponding economic derivative to hedge the risk of changes in fair value. As a result, this line item may not agree to the Statements of Income.\nThe CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The $2.2 trillion package was the largest stimulus bill in U.S. history. The CARES Act is in addition to previous relief legislation passed by Congress in March 2020. The legislation provides the following:\n1 Represents the loan-to-value at origination for the related loan.\n1 Represents the range of discounts applied to the unpaid principal balance or market value of collateral pledged.

The net fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items designated in fair value hedge relationships are also recognized as interest income or expense. Amortization of basis adjustments from terminated hedges and the amortization of the financing element of off-market derivatives are also recorded in interest income or expense.\n2 Represents cash, agency securities, and residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).\nCredit Risk\n\u2022an economic hedge to manage certain defined risks on the Bank's Statements of Condition (economic hedge). These hedges are primarily used to: (i) manage mismatches between the coupon features of the Bank's assets and liabilities, (ii) offset prepayment risk in certain assets, (iii) mitigate the income statement volatility that occurs when financial instruments are recorded at fair value and hedge accounting is not permitted by accounting guidance, or (iv) to reduce exposure to reset risk.\n\nThe decrease in regulatory capital stock held at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to a decline in member activity. For additional information on our capital stock, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Capital.\u201d\n2 Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items in qualifying fair value hedge relationships are reported in net interest income. Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items also includes the amortization of the financing element of off-market derivatives.\nECONOMIC HEDGES\n\u2022Provides the Treasury Secretary authority to make loans or loan guarantees to states, municipalities, and eligible businesses and loosens some regulations imposed through the Dodd-Frank Act;\n1 Represents either the lowest credit rating available for each investment based on an NRSRO, or the guarantor credit rating, if applicable.

Our mission is to be a reliable provider of funding, liquidity, and services for our members so that they can meet the housing, business, and economic development needs of the communities they serve. Our operating model balances the trade-off between attractively priced products, reasonable returns on capital stock, maintaining an adequate level of capital to meet regulatory capital requirements, and maintaining adequate retained earnings to preserve the par value of member-owned capital stock. Our members include commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, insurance companies, and CDFIs.\nThe following table summarizes our regulatory capital stock by type of member (dollars in millions):\nOnce a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse), the derivative transaction is novated and the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse. The Bank is not a derivative dealer and does not trade derivatives for short-term profit.\nThe following table reflects our funding spreads to LIBOR (basis points)1:\nFor additional information on regulatory action related to LIBOR, including our adherence to fallback protocol for certain derivative agreements, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legislative and Regulatory Developments.\u201d\nWe define market risk as the risk that changes in market prices may adversely affect our financial condition and performance. Interest rate risk is the principal type of market risk to which we are exposed as our cash flows, and therefore earnings and equity value, can change significantly as interest rates change. Our general approach toward managing interest rate risk is to acquire and maintain a portfolio of assets, liabilities, and derivatives, which taken together, limit our expected exposure to interest rate risk. Management regularly reviews our sensitivity to interest rate changes by monitoring our market risk measures in parallel and non-parallel interest rate changes and spread and volatility movements.\nFINANCE AGENCY SUPERVISORY LETTER - PLANNING FOR LIBOR PHASE-OUT\nInterest rate risk stress tests of MVCS involve instantaneous parallel and non-parallel changes in interest rates. The resulting percentage change in MVCS from the base case value is an indication of longer-term repricing risk and option risk embedded in the balance sheet.\nFor a discussion of our key capital adequacy measure, MVCS, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Market Risk - Market Value of Capital Stock Sensitivity.\u201d\nAlthough management has policies and procedures in place to manage credit risk, we may be exposed to this risk if our outstanding advance value exceeds the liquidation value of our collateral. We mitigate this risk by applying collateral discounts or haircuts to the unpaid principal balance or market value, as applicable, of the collateral to determine the advance equivalent value of the collateral securing each borrower's obligation. The amount of these discounts will vary based on the type of collateral and security agreement. We determine these discounts or haircuts using data based upon historical price changes, discounted cash flow analyses, and loan level modeling.\n6 Non-accrual loans are included in the average balance used to determine the average yield.\n\nWhen fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, we either terminate the derivative or continue to carry the derivative on the Statements of Condition at its fair value. For any remaining hedged item, we cease to adjust the hedged item for changes in fair value and amortize the cumulative basis adjustment on the hedged item into earnings over the remaining contractual life of the hedged item using a level-yield methodology.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, advances outstanding to our five largest member borrowers totaled $15.5 billion and $39.3 billion, representing 34 percent and 49 percent of our total advances outstanding. The following table summarizes advances outstanding to our five largest member borrowers at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\nBecause membership is voluntary, a member can provide a notice of withdrawal from membership at any time. If a member provides a notice of withdrawal from membership, we will not repurchase or redeem any membership stock until five years from the date of receipt of a notice of withdrawal. To the extent membership is terminated involuntarily, we may elect to repurchase that institution's membership stock prior to the end of the five-year redemption period. If a member withdraws or is involuntarily terminated from membership and holds activity-based capital stock, we will repurchase any such stock that is not required to support remaining business activity with the institution.\nThe following table presents changes in interest income and interest expense. Changes in interest income and interest expense that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but rather equally attributable to both volume and rate changes, are allocated to the volume and rate categories based on the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes (dollars in millions).\n1 Short-term investments have original maturities equal to or less than one year.\nThe following table shows our derivative counterparty credit exposure (dollars in millions):\n1 MBS are presented by contractual maturity, however, their expected maturities will likely differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees.\n3 Represents derivative transactions cleared with CME Clearing, our clearinghouse, who is not rated. CME Clearing's parent, CME Group Inc. was rated Aa3 by Moody's and AA- by Standard and Poor's at December 31, 2020.\nCompliance Risk\nWe do not expect this advisory bulletin to materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nUncleared Derivatives. Due to risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative agreements, we generally require collateral on uncleared derivative agreements. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty or a contractually established threshold level. A counterparty generally must deliver collateral to us if the total market value of our exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, we do not anticipate any credit losses on our uncleared derivative agreements.\n1 Source: The Office of Finance.\n\u2022Increase in retained earnings: We recorded net income of $362 million during 2020, which included net gains on litigation settlements in the amount of $120 million. Dividend payments for 2020 totaled $203 million. The earnings in excess of dividend payments had a positive impact on the market value of our assets, thereby increasing MVCS.\nWe also use liquidity to purchase mortgage loans, redeem member deposits, pledge collateral to derivative counterparties, redeem or repurchase capital stock, pay expenses, and pay dividends.\n1 Excludes contractual interest payments related to bonds. Total is based on contractual maturities; the actual timing of payments could be impacted by factors affecting redemptions.\nOperational Risk\nLIBOR Transition\nThe following table shows our contractual obligations due by payment period at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\nCapital Adequacy\nThe following table summarizes our advances by product type (dollars in millions):\nWe have never experienced a credit loss on our government-insured mortgage loans. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we determined no allowance for credit losses was necessary on our government-insured mortgage loans.\nDuring 2020, we recorded other income (loss) of $121 million compared to $20 million in 2019. Other income (loss) was primarily impacted by net gains on litigation settlements of $120 million in 2020 as a result of settlements with defendants in our private-label MBS litigation. We did not record any litigation settlements during 2019. Other factors impacting other income (loss) included net gains (losses) on trading securities and net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, borrowers pledged $280.5 billion and $329.4 billion of collateral (net of applicable discounts) to support activity with us, including advances. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of our advances met the requirement to be collateralized at a minimum of 100 percent, net of applicable discounts. Borrowers pledge collateral in excess of their collateral requirement mainly to demonstrate available liquidity and to borrow additional amounts in the future.\n\nThe following table summarizes the reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted net interest income (dollars in millions):\n\nThe following table shows the amount of collateral pledged to us (net of applicable discounts) by collateral type (dollars in billions):\nThis rule eliminates these stress testing requirements for the Bank, unless the Finance Agency exercises its discretion to require stress testing in the future. We do not expect this rule to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOther Income (Loss)\nMarket activity in SOFR-indexed financial instruments continues to increase and we continue to offer SOFR-indexed advances and issue SOFR-indexed debt. In 2020, we also began utilizing interest rate swaps based on the federal funds or SOFR OIS rates as an alternative to using LIBOR when entering into new derivative transactions.\nBeginning January 1, 2019, we adopted new hedge accounting guidance, which impacted the presentation of gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities for qualifying hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, any hedge ineffectiveness, or the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in fair value of the hedged item, was recorded in other income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d Two approaches to fair value hedge accounting include:\nIn March 2020, the FOMC lowered the Federal Reserve's key target interest rate, the federal funds rate, to a range of zero to 0.25 percent and maintained that range throughout 2020, compared to a range of 1.50 to 1.75 percent for 2019.\nWe primarily limit short-term unsecured credit exposure to the following overnight investment types:\nAs noted throughout this report, many of our advances, investments, consolidated obligation bonds, derivatives, and related collateral are indexed to LIBOR. Some of these assets and liabilities and related collateral have maturity dates that extend beyond 2021. We are preparing for a transition away from LIBOR and plan to utilize SOFR as the dominant replacement rate on an ongoing basis. We have developed a transition plan that will change with market developments and member needs and addresses considerations such as LIBOR exposure, member products, fallback language, operational preparedness, and balance sheet management.\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin 2020-01 Federal Home Loan Bank AMA Risk Management\nWe do not expect these rules to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThis strategy of issuing consolidated obligations while simultaneously entering into derivatives enables us to offer a wider range of attractively priced advances to our borrowers and may allow us to reduce our funding costs. While consolidated obligations are the joint and several obligations of the FHLBanks, each FHLBank serves as sole counterparty to derivative agreements associated with specific debt issues for which it is the primary obligor.\nUnpledged Qualifying Assets - We are required to maintain, in the aggregate, unpledged qualifying assets in an amount at least equal to the amount of our participation in total consolidated obligations outstanding. The following table shows our compliance with this requirement (dollars in billions):\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak developed during 2020, the capital markets became more volatile. Despite the increased market volatility, we were operationally prepared, maintained continual access to funding, and issued debt to meet the needs of our members. Access to debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preference and our government affiliation, have sought the FHLBanks' debt as an asset of choice. However, due to the short-term maturity of the debt, we may be exposed to additional risks associated with refinancing and our ability to access the capital markets.\nFor additional information on our consolidated obligations, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity - Sources of Liquidity.\u201d\nFor prices obtained externally, we have control processes in place to ensure fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. These processes include but are not limited to; challenging a price when it falls out of our tolerance parameters and identifying a stale price, significantly changed price, or other anomalies that may indicate that a price may not be accurate. In addition, on an annual basis, we conduct reviews of our pricing vendors to confirm and further augment our understanding of the vendors' pricing processes, methodologies, and control procedures for investment securities. For internal pricing models, the underlying assumptions are based on management's best estimates for discount rates, prepayments, market volatility, and other factors. The assumptions used in both external and internal pricing models could have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including the related income and expense. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in materially different values.\nWe evaluate mortgage loans for credit losses on a quarterly basis and establish an allowance for credit losses to reflect management's estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio. We adopted new accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2020.\nThe following table shows the five largest state concentrations of our conventional MPF portfolio. All percentages are calculated based on unpaid principal balances as of the applicable period end.\nModels are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on assumptions about future performance. Changes in any models or in any of the assumptions, judgments, or estimates used in the models may cause the results generated by the model to be materially different. Our risk computations require the use of instantaneous shifts in assumptions, such as interest rates, spreads, volatilities, and prepayment speeds. These computations may differ from our actual interest rate risk exposure because they do not take into account any portfolio re-balancing and hedging actions that are required to maintain risk exposures within our policies and guidelines. We have adopted controls, procedures, and policies to monitor and manage assumptions used in these models which are regularly validated.\n\u2022Expands eligibility for unemployment insurance and payment amounts; and\n\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON ECONOMIC HEDGES\nFurther, on January 5, 2021, the CFTC published a final rule, effective February 4, 2021, that primarily amends the minimum margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps under the jurisdiction of the CFTC (CFTC Margin Rules) by requiring covered entities to use a revised AANA calculation starting on September 1, 2022. The amendments, among other things, require entities subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction to calculate the AANA for uncleared swaps during March, April and May of the current year, based on an average of month-end dates, as opposed to the previous requirement which required the calculation of AANA during June, July and August of the prior year, based on daily calculations. Parties would continue to be expected to exchange IM based on the AANA totals as of September 1 of the current year. These amendments align with the recommendation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions. Separately, on January 25, 2021, the CFTC published a final rule, effective February 24, 2021, that amends the CFTC Margin Rules to permit, among other changes, covered swap entities to maintain separate minimum transfer amounts (MTA) for IM and variation margin for each swap counterparty, provided the combined MTA does not exceed $500,000.\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden (and before him, President Trump), through executive orders, governmental agencies, including the SEC, OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, National Credit Union Administration, CFTC and the Finance Agency, as well as state governments and agencies, have taken, and may continue to take, actions to provide various forms of relief from, and guidance regarding, the financial, operational, credit, market, and other effects of the pandemic, some of which may have a direct or indirect impact on us or our members. Many of these actions are temporary in nature. We continue to monitor these actions and guidance as they evolve and to evaluate their potential impact on us.\n1 Represents the amortization/accretion of basis adjustments on closed hedge relationships.\nIn an effort to protect the MVCS from large interest rate swings, we manage the interest rate risk of our balance sheet by using hedging transactions, such as issuing consolidated obligation bonds, including floating rate, simple bullet, callable, or other structured features and entering into or canceling interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and swaptions.\nStatements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, including statements describing the objectives, projections, estimates, or future predictions in our operations, may be forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as believes, projects, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, could, should, may, and will or their negatives or other variations on these terms. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk or uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied or could affect the extent to which a particular objective, projection, estimate, or prediction is realized. As a result, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties is included under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\n\n\n9 Represents net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.\nThe following table summarizes advances by interest rate payment and redemption terms (dollars in millions):\n1 Concessions represent fees paid to dealers in connection with the issuance of certain consolidated obligation bonds.\nOn January 14, 2021, Treasury and Fannie Mae entered into a letter agreement amending the terms of their Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (PSPA), which could impact PFIs that participate in the MPF Program's MPF Xtra product (where MPF loans acquired are concurrently sold to Fannie Mae). Under the PSPA, Treasury provides liquidity to Fannie Mae in exchange for senior preferred stock. Under the recent PSPA amendment, effective January 1, 2022, the Finance Agency (acting as conservator for Fannie Mae) and Treasury agreed to limit the dollar volume of loans Fannie Mae could purchase from a single seller through Fannie Mae's cash window to $1.5 billion per year. As administrator of the MPF Program, the FHLBank of Chicago purchases MPF Xtra loans from PFIs and sells them to Fannie Mae via the cash window process. Based on volumes for the MPF Xtra product program-wide in 2020, the PSPA amendment would significantly curtail MPF Xtra cash window sales. Although this would negatively impact the volume of loans sold through the MPF Program unless a solution is developed, we do not currently expect it to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nProjected income sensitivity is measured as the change in spread between projected 24-month return on average capital stock (ROACS) and an average projected reference rate. Effective July 1, 2020, we utilize average projected SOFR as our reference rate. Prior to July 1, 2020, we utilized average projected three-month LIBOR as our reference rate.\nInterest income on investments decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019 due primarily to the lower interest rate environment. Interest income on investments increased during 2019 when compared to 2018 due primarily to higher average money market investment balances as a result of increased liquidity needs resulting from advance demand during 2019 and the higher interest rate environment on average. This increase was partially offset by lower average MBS and other investment balances.\nWe utilize economic derivatives to manage certain risks on our Statements of Condition. Gains and losses on economic derivatives are driven by changes in interest rates and volatility and include interest settlements. Interest settlements represent the interest component on economic derivatives. These amounts vary from period to period depending on our hedging activities and interest rates. During 2020, we recorded net losses of $48 million on our economic derivatives. The fair value changes were primarily driven by changes in interest rates which impacted the fair value of interest rate swaps used to economically hedge our investment securities portfolio as highlighted in the table below. These changes were primarily driven by market volatility caused by COVID-19 and the impact it had on interest rates.\n\n2 Net credit exposure is less than $1 million.\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES AND HEDGED ITEMS\nLIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS\n2 Prepayment fees on investments, net includes basis adjustment amortization and premium and/or discount amortization.\n\nInterest expense on bonds decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019 due primarily to the lower interest rate environment and lower average bond balances, largely driven by a decrease in the amount of consolidated obligations needed to fund our assets. In addition, during 2020, we increased our usage of shorter-term discount notes relative to bonds in an effort to capture attractive funding, match the repricing structures on floating rate assets, and meet our liquidity requirements. Interest expense on bonds increased during 2019 when compared to 2018 due primarily to the higher interest rate environment on average, offset in part by lower average bond balances driven by a reduction in total assets.\nThe following table shows our 24-month projected ROACS spread to the average projected reference rate and associated policy limits, assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n4 Represents mortgage loan purchase commitments with our member institutions.\n\u2022Step-Down Bonds.

We invest in government-insured fixed rate mortgage loans that are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and/or the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture. The servicer or PFI obtains and maintains insurance or a guaranty from the applicable government agency. The servicer or PFI is responsible for compliance with all government agency requirements and for obtaining the benefit of the applicable guarantee or insurance with respect to defaulted government-insured mortgage loans. Any losses incurred on these loans that are not recovered from the insurer/guarantor are absorbed by the servicers. As such, we only have credit risk for these loans if the servicer or PFI fails to pay for losses not covered by the guarantee or insurance.\nMORTGAGE LOANS\n3 Represents the interest component on derivatives that qualify for fair value hedge accounting.\nWe are subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative agreements. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures and collateral requirements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. We manage credit risk through credit analyses, collateral requirements, and adherence to the requirements set forth in our policies and Finance Agency regulations.\nWe use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. The notional amount of derivatives serves as a factor in determining periodic interest payments and cash flows received and paid. However, the notional amount of derivatives represents neither the actual amounts exchanged nor our overall exposure to credit and market risk.\n3 Represents investment securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\nWe manage the credit risk on mortgage loans by (i) adhering to our underwriting standards, (ii) using agreements to establish credit risk sharing responsibilities with our PFIs, and (iii) monitoring the performance of the mortgage loan portfolio and creditworthiness of PFIs.\nAs a result of the final rule on membership issued by the Finance Agency effective February 19, 2016, the eligibility requirements for FHLBank members were changed, rendering captive insurance company members ineligible for FHLBank membership. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members prior to September 12, 2014, had their memberships terminated February 19, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, while we had five captive insurance company members, none had advances outstanding.\nWe evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. While management believes our estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on historical experience and other factors, actual results could differ from those estimates and differences could be material to the financial statements.\n\n\nThe following table presents comparative highlights of our net income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions). See further discussion of changes in our results of operations in the sections that follow.\n3 The average balance of AFS securities is reflected at amortized cost; therefore the resulting yields do not give effect to changes in fair value.\n\nPROJECTED INCOME SENSITIVITY\nGains and losses on our trading securities are also due primarily to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. The following table summarizes gains and losses on these economic derivatives as well as the related trading securities (dollars in millions):\nOur risk management policies include a target level of retained earnings based on the amount we believe necessary to help protect the redemption value of capital stock, facilitate safe and sound operations, maintain regulatory capital ratios, and support our ability to pay a relatively stable dividend. We monitor our achievement of this target and may utilize tools such as restructuring our balance sheet, generating additional income, reducing our risk exposures, increasing capital stock requirements, or reducing our dividends to achieve our targeted level of retained earnings. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our actual retained earnings exceeded our retained earnings target.\n\nIn assessing our current exposure to LIBOR, we have developed an inventory of financial instruments impacted and identified contracts that may require adding or adjusting the fallback language. We have added or adjusted fallback language to our advance agreements with members and added fallback language to our consolidated obligation agreements. We continue to monitor the market-wide efforts to address fallback language related to derivatives and investment securities as well as fallback language for new activities and issuances of financial instruments. We are in the process of ensuring we are operationally ready, including updating our processes and information technology systems to support the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.\nDuring 2020, we recorded net gains on trading securities of $17 million compared to net gains of $28 million in 2019. These changes in fair value were primarily due to the impact of changes in interest rates and credit spreads on our fixed rate trading securities which stemmed from market volatility caused by COVID-19. Trading securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected through other income (loss).\nRefer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 - Fair Value\u201d for additional discussion on our fair value measurements.\n\n3 Represents commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).\nNet interest settlements represent the interest component on derivatives. These amounts vary from period to period depending on our hedging activities and interest rates and are partially offset by the interest component on the related hedged item within net interest income. The hedging activity tables do not include the impact of the interest component on the related hedged item.\nOur ability to raise funds in the capital markets as well as our cost of borrowing may be affected by our credit ratings. As of February 28, 2021, our consolidated obligations were rated AA+/A-1+ by Standard and Poor's and Aaa/P-1 by Moody's and both ratings had a stable outlook. In August 2020, Fitch Ratings affirmed the long-term U.S. sovereign AAA rating, but revised the outlook to negative\u201d from stable.\u201d Following this action, Fitch Ratings also affirmed our long-term AAA rating and revised the outlook to negative\u201d from stable.\u201d At February 28, 2021, our consolidated obligations remained rated AAA with a negative outlook by Fitch Ratings. For further discussion of how credit rating changes and our ability to access the capital markets may impact us in the future, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe are exposed to credit risk through our participation in the MPF program and the MPP. Mortgage loan credit risk is the risk that we will not receive timely payments of principal and interest due from mortgage borrowers because of borrower defaults. Credit risk on mortgage loans is affected by a number of factors, including loan type, borrower's credit history, and other factors such as home price fluctuations, unemployment levels, and other economic factors in the local market or nationwide.\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loan portfolio by product type (dollars in millions):\nIn the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded on our Statements of Condition or may be recorded on our Statements of Condition in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transactions. For additional information on our off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nConsolidated obligations, which include bonds and discount notes, are the primary source of funds to support our advances, mortgage loans, and investments. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of consolidated obligations for which we are primarily liable totaled $79.6 billion and $121.1 billion.\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nThe effects of COVID-19 and the response to the virus continue to impact financial markets and overall economic conditions. In keeping with our mission to be a reliable provider of liquidity in all economic environments, we remain dedicated to meeting the needs of members through these challenging and unusual times. We have implemented certain relief measures to help members serve customers affected by COVID-19, such as accommodating forbearance and modifications to pledged loan collateral, allowing electronic signatures on loan documentation in specific circumstances, and adding payment deferment as another viable post-forbearance repayment option for participating financial institution (PFI) servicers to assist impacted borrowers.\n1 Source: Bloomberg.\n\nIn response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the majority of our employees continue to work remotely, with a limited number of employees voluntarily working from our headquarters. Many of our members, vendors, and regulators continue to work remotely. While our operations have changed as a result of the global pandemic, we currently do not believe the current working arrangement creates additional operational risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\nAn adequate capital position is necessary for providing safe and sound operations of the Bank. Our key capital adequacy measures are MVCS and regulatory capital in order to maintain capital levels in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. In addition, we maintain a targeted level of retained earnings to protect the redemption value of capital stock, facilitate safe and sound operations, maintain regulatory capital ratios, and support our ability to pay a relatively stable dividend.\nLiquidity\n2 Net credit exposure is less than $1 million.\nOur Board of Directors may declare and pay different dividends for each subclass of capital stock. Dividend payments may be made in the form of cash and/or additional shares of capital stock. Historically, we have only paid cash dividends. By regulation, we may only pay dividends from current earnings or unrestricted retained earnings. We are prohibited from paying a dividend in the form of additional shares of capital stock if, after the issuance, the outstanding excess capital stock would be greater than one percent of our total assets. Our Board of Directors may not declare or pay dividends if it would result in our non-compliance with regulatory capital requirements.\nMortgage Markets\nBeginning in March 2020, the impact of COVID-19 significantly affected the U.S. housing markets and resulted in declines in interest rates, home inventory, and home sales. In the second half of 2020, the housing market began to show signs of recovery. Home sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 to levels above the fourth quarter of 2019 and housing inventory remained low, resulting in higher home prices. During 2020, mortgage rates continued to decline, on average, and refinancing activity remained the primary driver of mortgage activity.\nFair values play an important role in our valuation of certain assets, liabilities, and hedging transactions. Fair value is first determined based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, where available. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, fair values are determined based on external or internal pricing models that use (i) discounted cash flows using market estimates of interest rates and volatility, (ii) dealer prices, or (iii) prices of similar instruments.\nADVANCES\nMandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock\nInvestments\nThe method for calculating fair value is dependent on the instrument type. Option-free instruments, such as plain vanilla interest rate swaps, bonds, and advances require an assessment of the future course of interest rates. Once the course of interest rates has been specified and the expected cash flows determined, future cash flows are discounted to compute the fair value. Options and option-embedded instruments, such as cancelable interest rate swaps, swaptions, interest rate caps and floors, callable bonds, and mortgage-related instruments, are typically evaluated using an interest rate tree (lattice) or Monte Carlo simulations that generate a large number of possible interest rate scenarios.\nDuring 2020, advance disbursements totaled $146.8 billion compared to $264.6 billion in 2019. Advance disbursements will vary from period to period depending on member needs. During 2020, investment purchases (excluding overnight investments) totaled $19.6 billion compared to $147.2 billion in 2019. Investment purchases during each period were primarily driven by the purchase of money market investments, including secured resale agreements, or U.S. Treasury securities in an effort to manage our liquidity position.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nConsistent with the additional analysis and monitoring on our other Bank products, we are taking additional steps to monitor our derivatives' credit risk given the recent market volatility stemming from COVID-19. In addition, we continue to monitor market volatility and counterparty ratings, counterparty pricing, news, sovereign and counterparty research, market research and articles, and other COVID-19 analysis.\nOur base case MVCS was $171.0 at December 31, 2020 compared to $147.2 at December 31, 2019. The change was primarily attributable to the following factors:\nUSES OF LIQUIDITY\nWe may also enter into economic derivatives in an effort to mitigate the income statement volatility that occurs when consolidated obligations are recorded under the fair value option and hedge accounting is not permitted.\n4 Represents amounts recorded in Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d on the Statements of Income.\nThe following table shows the Bank's total exposure, including advances, as well as the collateralization percentage of outstanding exposures by borrower type (dollars in millions):\nWe evaluate mortgage loans for credit losses on a quarterly basis. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, our allowance for credit losses totaled $1 million. For additional discussion on our mortgage loan credit risk, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Credit Risk - Mortgage Loans.\u201d\nThe Office of Finance and FHLBanks have contingency plans in place that prioritize the allocation of proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations during periods of financial distress if consolidated obligations cannot be issued in sufficient amounts to satisfy all FHLBank demand. In the event of significant market disruptions or local disasters, our President or designee is authorized to establish interim borrowing relationships with other FHLBanks. To provide further access to funding, the FHLBank Act also authorizes the U.S. Treasury to directly purchase new issue consolidated obligations of the GSEs, including FHLBanks, up to an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. As of February 28, 2021, no purchases had been made by the U.S. Treasury under this authorization.\nLiquidity Risk\nWe use our available liquidity, including proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations, primarily to repay consolidated obligations, fund advances, and purchase investments. During 2020, repayments of consolidated obligations totaled $263.0 billion compared to $203.7 billion in 2019. A portion of these payments were due to the call of certain bonds in an effort to better match our projected asset cash flows. During 2020, we called bonds with a total par value of $2.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 2019.\nThird, we cannot redeem shares of capital stock from any member if the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation of the FHLBank System is not paid in full when due, or under certain circumstances if (i) we project, at any time, that we will fail to comply with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements, or will be unable to timely and fully meet all of our current obligations, (ii) we actually fail to comply with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements or to timely and fully meet all of our current obligations, or enter or negotiate to enter into an agreement with one or more other FHLBanks to obtain financial assistance to meet our current obligations, or (iii) the Finance Agency determines that we will cease to be in compliance with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements, or will lack the capacity to timely or fully meet all of our current obligations.\nWe remain focused on both the health and safety of our employees. The majority of our employees continue to work remotely, with a limited number of employees voluntarily working from our headquarters. We have not experienced and do not expect to experience any impairment of our ability to meet the needs of members.\n3 Represents,gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items in qualifying hedging relationships. Amounts do not include the amortization of the financing element of off-market derivatives.\n\n\n\nAdvances\nIn July 2017, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021 it will no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee to identify a set of alternative reference interest rates for possible use as market benchmarks. This committee proposed SOFR as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in the second quarter of 2018. SOFR is based on a broad segment of the overnight Treasury repurchase market and is intended to be a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.\n1 Concessions represent fees paid to dealers in connection with the issuance of certain consolidated obligation discount notes.\n\nBalance Sheet\nLEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\nConventional Mortgage Loans. We determine our allowance for credit losses on conventional loans through analyses that include consideration of various loan portfolio and collateral-related characteristics, such as past performance, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected economic conditions. Conventional mortgage loans are evaluated collectively when similar risk characteristics exists. Conventional loans that do not share risk characteristics with other pools are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis. In limited instances, we may incorporate a management adjustment in the allowance for credit losses for conventional mortgage loans due to changes in economic and business conditions or other factors that may not be fully captured in our model. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the allowance for credit losses on our conventional loans was $1 million.\nThe U.S. Treasury yields have declined to historically low levels and mortgage rates were lower on average during 2020 when compared to 2019. The global concerns related to COVID-19 and the impact on economic activity have led to lower interest rates. As interest rates declined, our net income was negatively impacted.\n3 Represents investment securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\n2 Interest income and expense amounts reported for advances, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), other investments, and consolidated obligation bonds include gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships.\nOur down 200 basis point policy limit is suspended when the 10-year swap rate is below 2.50 percent and remains so for five consecutive days. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the 10-year swap rate had been below 2.50 percent for five consecutive days, and therefore the associated policy limit was suspended.\nOn July 1, 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Farm Credit Administration, and the Finance Agency (collectively, Prudential Banking Regulators) jointly published a final rule, effective August 31, 2020, amending regulations that established minimum margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps for covered swap entities under the jurisdiction of the Prudential Banking Regulators (Prudential Margin Rules). In addition to other changes, the final rule (i) allows swaps entered into by a covered swap entity prior to an applicable compliance date to retain their legacy status and not become subject to the Prudential Margin Rules in the event that the legacy swaps are amended to replace an interbank offered rate (such as LIBOR) or other discontinued rate, or due to other technical amendments, notional reductions or portfolio compression exercises, (ii) introduces a new Phase 6 compliance date for initial margin requirements for covered swap entities and their counterparties with an average daily aggregate notional amount (AANA) of uncleared swaps of at least $8 billion, and (iii) clarifies that initial margin (IM) trading documentation does not need to be executed prior to the parties becoming obligated to exchange IM.\nOther expense increased $21 million during 2020 when compared to 2019, driven primarily by an increase in compensation and benefits. The increase in compensation and benefits was primarily due to increased pension costs as a result of us making a discretionary contribution of $32 million at the end of the year. We did not make a discretionary pension contribution in 2019. This increase was offset in part by a decline in other operating expenses and professional fees. Other operating expenses decreased due to lower depreciation expense on core system projects and fewer employee travel costs in light of COVID-19. Professional fees declined as a result of fewer external resources to assist with our technology and operational initiatives during the year.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our discount notes, all of which are due within one year (dollars in millions):\nWe define credit risk as the potential that our borrowers or counterparties will fail to meet their obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Our primary credit risks arise from our ongoing lending, investing, and hedging activities. Our overall objective in managing credit risk is to operate a sound credit granting process and to maintain appropriate credit administration, measurement, and monitoring practices.\nDISCONTINUANCE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING\nCOVID-19\nFinance Agency regulations also include limits on the amount of unsecured credit we may extend to a counterparty or to a group of affiliated counterparties. These limits are based on a percentage of eligible regulatory capital and the counterparty's overall credit rating. Under these regulations, the level of eligible regulatory capital is determined as the lesser of our total regulatory capital or the eligible amount of regulatory capital of the counterparty. The eligible amount of regulatory capital is then multiplied by a stated percentage. The percentage that we may offer for extensions of unsecured credit, excluding overnight federal funds sold, ranges from three to 15 percent based on the counterparty's credit rating. Our total unsecured exposure to a counterparty, including overnight federal funds sold, may not exceed twice that amount, or a total of six to 30 percent of the eligible amount of regulatory capital, based on the counterparty's credit rating. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the regulatory limits established for unsecured credit.\n1 The change from base case for the up 100 basis point scenario was less than 0.1 percent.\n7 Other interest-bearing liabilities consists of mandatorily redeemable capital stock and borrowings from other FHLBanks.\nNet Income\nOn the same date, the Prudential Banking Regulators published an interim final rule, effective September 1, 2020, extending the IM compliance date for Phase 6 counterparties to September 1, 2022. On November 9, 2020, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) published a final rule extending the IM compliance date for Phase 6 counterparties to September 1, 2022, thereby aligning with the Prudential Banking Regulators.\nThe following table shows conventional MPF and MPP loans by loan-to-value ratio at origination. All percentages are calculated based on unpaid principal balances as of the applicable period end.\nTotal capital decreased to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020 from $6.7 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in capital stock resulting from a decline in member activity. Our regulatory capital ratio increased to 6.55 percent at December 31, 2020, from 5.31 percent at December 31, 2019, and was above the required regulatory minimum at each period end. Regulatory capital includes all capital stock, mandatorily redeemable capital stock, and retained earnings.\nOur key market risk measures are Market Value of Capital Stock (MVCS) Sensitivity and Projected Income Sensitivity.\nConsolidated Obligations\n2 Prepayment fees on investments, net includes basis adjustment amortization and premium and/or discount amortization.\nThe following table summarizes our bonds by interest rate payment terms (dollars in millions):\nWe evaluate advances for credit losses on a quarterly basis and have never experienced a credit loss on our advances. In December 2020, we declared a member bank in default under its contractual terms and individually assessed the related advances for expected credit losses as of December 31, 2020, concluding no allowance for credit losses was necessary in light of the advances being well-secured with underlying collateral. All other advances were evaluated on a collective basis as of December 31, 2020 and, based upon our collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on advances, we determined there were no expected credit losses on those advances.\nWe monitor and manage to the MVCS policy limits in an effort to ensure the stability of the Bank's value. Our policy limits are based on declines from the base case in parallel and non-parallel interest rate change scenarios. Any policy limit breach requires a prompt action to address the measure outside of the policy limit and the breach must be reported to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Bank and the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. We were in compliance with the MVCS policy limits at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nNet interest spread equals the yield on total interest-earning assets minus the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. During 2020, our net interest spread was 0.38 percent compared to 0.29 percent and 0.32 percent for the same periods in 2019 and 2018. Our net interest spread during 2020 was primarily impacted by increased advance prepayment fee income of $66 million compared to the same period in 2019. The primary components of our interest income and interest expense are discussed below.\nThe following table shows information on key market interest rates1:\n\n3 Long-term investments have original maturities of greater than one year.\n\nWe may hedge a firm commitment for a forward-starting advance through the use of an interest-rate swap (fair value hedge). In this case, the interest rate swap functions as the hedging instrument for both the firm commitment and the subsequent advance. We may also enter into economic derivatives in an effort to mitigate the income statement volatility that occurs when an advance or firm commitment for a forward-starting advance is recorded under the fair value option and hedge accounting is not permitted.\nEMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\nWe cannot repurchase or redeem any membership or activity-based capital stock if the repurchase or redemption would cause a member to be out of compliance with its required investment. In addition, there are statutory and regulatory restrictions on our obligation or right to redeem outstanding capital stock.\nMARKET VALUE OF CAPITAL STOCK SENSITIVITY\nThis Liquidity Guidance AB also specifies appropriate funding gap limits to address the risks associated with a FHLBank having too large a mismatch between the contractual maturities of its assets and liabilities. A funding gap measures the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period and is expressed as a percentage of total assets. The guidance provides funding gap limits within the range of negative 10 percent to negative 20 percent for a three-month horizon and negative 25 percent to negative 35 percent for a one-year horizon. Initial guidance, which was in effect at December 31, 2019, was set at a trailing three-month average of negative 15 percent for the three-month horizon and a trailing three-month average of negative 30 percent for the one-year horizon. In addition to the relief provided for base case liquidity noted above, on March 12, 2020, the Finance Agency also increased the funding gap ratios for the three-month and one-year time horizons during the year. The recommended funding gap maximums were reduced to negative 20 percent at the three-month horizon and negative 35 percent at the one-year horizon by December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we adhered to these funding gap requirements.\nWe may enter into certain economic derivatives as macro balance sheet hedges to protect against changes in interest rates, including prepayments on mortgage assets. These economic derivatives may include interest rate caps, floors, swaps, and swaptions.\nOther Expense\nWe define MVCS as an estimate of the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities (excluding mandatorily redeemable capital stock) divided by the total shares of capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) outstanding. It represents an estimation of the liquidation value\u201d of one share of our capital stock if all assets and liabilities were liquidated at current market prices. MVCS does not represent our long-term value, as it takes into account short-term market price fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the long-term value of the cash flows from our assets and liabilities.\nOur bonds decreased $39.3 billion or 43 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in total assets. In addition, we increased our usage of shorter-term discount notes relative to bonds in an effort to capture attractive funding, match the repricing structures on floating rate assets, and meet our liquidity requirements. Fair value hedging adjustments changed $150 million at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019, due to the impact of interest rates on our cumulative fair value adjustments on bonds in hedge relationships.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nWe use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Accounting rules affect the timing and recognition of income and expense on derivatives and therefore we may be subject to income statement volatility.\nHedging Activities\nMargin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities\n5 Represents the net gains (losses) on those trading securities in which we have entered into a corresponding economic derivative to hedge the risk of changes in fair value. As a result, this line item may not agree to the Statements of Income.\n\n2 Represents investment securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\nFinancial Results\nAs a result of recent deteriorating market and economic conditions stemming from COVID-19, we may be subject to increased credit risk on our mortgage loan portfolio. To assist homeowners affected by the current economic conditions, we have implemented several programs, including temporary mortgage payment forbearance and a temporary moratorium on foreclosures and evictions. The extent to which these programs will impact our mortgage portfolio and results of operations\nInterest income on advances decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019, due primarily to the lower interest rate environment and lower average advance balances, partially offset by an increase in advance prepayment fee income. The decrease in average advance balances from prior year was primarily a result of a decline in advances from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and decreased demand for advances across the majority of other institution types, driven primarily by increased liquidity in the financial markets and higher member deposit levels. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in borrowings by non-captive insurance companies. We do not expect significant new advances to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in the near future and this trend of paydowns and decreased new borrowings by members may continue. Interest income on advances increased during 2019 when compared to 2018, due primarily to the higher interest rate environment on average, partially offset by lower average advance balances as a result of a decline in advances from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and captive insurance company members.\nWe evaluate investments for credit losses on a quarterly basis. We adopted new accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we determined no allowance for credit losses was necessary on our investments. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Investments\u201d for additional information our allowance for credit losses.\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank Liquidity (the Liquidity Guidance AB) - This guidance requires us to maintain sufficient liquidity for a period of 10 to 30 calendar days. The base case scenario requires 20 days of positive daily cash balances and assumes that we cannot access the capital markets to issue debt, and during that time we will automatically renew maturing and called advances for all members, including very large highly-rated members, and we hold additional liquid assets equal to one percent of our letters of credit balances. As a result of the deterioration in financial market conditions due to COVID-19, the Finance Agency issued revised guidance in March 2020 lowering the base case liquidity requirements during the year. However, the required calendar days of positive daily cash balances returned to 20 days by December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with this base case liquidity guidance.\n\nFor additional information on our compliance with regulatory capital requirements as well as our targeted retained earnings, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThe path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In its December 16, 2020 statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee) stated that it decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to 0.25 percent. The Committee stated that it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to two percent and is on track to moderately exceed two percent for some time. The Committee stated that the assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures, inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\nThe following table summarizes dividend-related information (dollars in millions):\n1 Average balances are calculated on a daily weighted average basis and do not reflect the effect of derivative master netting arrangements with counterparties and/or clearing agents.\n1 Prepayment fees on advances, net includes basis adjustment amortization and premium and/or discount amortization.\nThe adjusted net income methodology is calculated on a post Affordable Housing Program (AHP) assessment basis. Management believes AHP assessments are a fundamental component of our business and believes this assessment should be included in our adjusted net income calculation. In addition, this treatment aligns the adjusted net income results to our strategic business plan, which is calculated on a post AHP assessment basis.\nFunding for the PPP, which was created by the CARES Act, was increased with the enactment of subsequent laws, most recently by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, on December 27, 2020. While some provisions of the CARES Act have expired, others have been extended by regulatory and legislative action. Additional phases of the CARES Act or other COVID-19 pandemic relief legislation may be enacted by Congress. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of such legislation on our business, including its continued impact to the U.S. economy, impacts to mortgages held or serviced by our members and that we accept as collateral, and the impacts on our MPF program.\nAs a result of the merger with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (Merger), we acquired certain offsetting interest rate swaps and classified these as economic derivatives.\nOur total advance par value decreased $34.1 billion or 43 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings of $25.5 billion by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as they paid off their remaining advance balances during 2020. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. had our largest concentration of advances outstanding at December 31, 2019. We do not expect significant new advances to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in the near future and this trend of paydowns and decreased new borrowings by members may continue. In 2020, we experienced decreased demand for advances across the majority of our other institution types, driven primarily by increased liquidity in the financial markets and higher member deposit levels.\nOur MD&A is organized as follows:\nInvestments\n3 Represents derivative transactions cleared with CME Clearing, our clearinghouse, who is not rated. CME Clearing's parent, CME Group Inc. was rated Aa3 by Moody's and AA-by Standard and Poor's at December 31, 2019.\nAs a result of the market volatility experienced during 2020 due in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Finance Agency extended the FHLBanks' authority to enter into LIBOR-based instruments that mature after December 31, 2021 from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020. In addition, the Finance Agency extended the requirement to update pledged collateral certification reporting requirements from March 31, 2020, to September 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, we ceased execution of new LIBOR indexed transactions with maturities beyond December 31, 2021.\nWe transact most of our derivative transactions with large banks and major broker-dealers. Over-the-counter derivative transactions may be either executed directly with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., a clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (cleared derivatives). We utilize one Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse), CME Clearing, for all cleared derivative transactions. CME Clearing notifies the clearing agent of the required initial margin and daily variation margin payments, and the clearing agent in turn notifies the Bank. The Clearinghouse determines initial margin requirements which are considered cash collateral. Variation margin requirements with CME Clearing are based on changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives and are legally characterized as daily settlement payments, which are a component of the derivative fair value, rather than cash collateral.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of our investments by credit rating (dollars in millions):\nWe categorize our financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level hierarchy. The hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs used to value the asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not carry any financial assets or liabilities, measured on a recurring basis, at fair value on our Statements of Condition based on unobservable inputs.\nOur total assets decreased to $87.7 billion at December 31, 2020, from $129.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Our total liabilities decreased to $82.0 billion at December 31, 2020, from $122.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Total capital decreased to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020, from $6.7 billion at December 31, 2019. See further discussion of changes in our financial condition in the sections that follow.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments and assumptions that affect our reported results and disclosures. Certain of our accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others to our financial results. Given the assumptions and judgment used, we have identified fair value measurements and derivatives and hedging activities as critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we are primarily liable for the portion of consolidated obligations that are issued on our behalf, we are also jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all consolidated obligations issued by the FHLBank System. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations for which we are primarily liable was $79.3 billion and $121.0 billion. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations issued on behalf of other FHLBanks for which we are jointly and severally liable was $667.5 billion and $904.9 billion.\n\nwill depend on the number of homeowners who partake in these programs in the months to come. In the second quarter of 2020, we also elected to apply the troubled debt restructuring (TDR) relief provided by the CARES Act on our conventional mortgage loan portfolio.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio.\u201d\n\u2022 cash deposited with us; and\nThe following tables show our policy limits and base case and change from base case MVCS in dollars per share and percent change respectively, based on outstanding shares of capital stock, including shares classified as mandatorily redeemable, assuming instantaneous parallel changes in interest rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe following table categorizes the net effect of hedging activities on net income by product (dollars in millions):\nInformation security risk includes the risk that cyber incidents could result in a failure or interruption of our business operations. We have not experienced any such disruption with a material adverse impact. However, we do rely heavily on internal and third-party information systems and other technology to conduct and manage our business and any disruptions to those items could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We mitigate cybersecurity risk utilizing the concept of defense in depth, where multiple layers of security controls are implemented. Administrative, physical, and logical controls are in place for identifying, monitoring, and controlling system access, sensitive data, and system changes. In addition, we employ thorough security testing and training that includes regular third party facilitated penetration testing, as well as mandatory staff training on cyber risks. Given the importance of cybersecurity and ever-increasing sophistication of potential cyber-attacks, we have recently strengthened our cyber-defenses and expect to continue to do so.\n1 Represents either the lowest credit rating available for each investment based on an NRSRO, or the guarantor credit rating, if applicable. In instances where an NRSRO rating or guarantor rating is not available for the investment, the investment is classified as unrated.\nUnited States Department of Treasury (Treasury) and Fannie Mae Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment\n\n1 Represents either the lowest credit rating available for each counterparty based on an NRSRO, or the guarantor credit rating, if applicable. In instances where an NRSRO rating or guarantor rating is not available for the investment, the investment is classified as unrated.\nInvestments\nWe may issue debt, make advances, or purchase financial instruments in which a derivative instrument is embedded.\u201d Upon execution of these transactions, we assess whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the debt, advance, or purchased financial instrument (the host contract) and whether a separate, non-embedded instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. If we determine that the embedded derivative has economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract, carried at fair value, and designated as an economic derivative instrument. However, if we elect to carry the entire contract (the host contract and the embedded derivative) at fair value on the Statements of Condition, changes in fair value of the entire contract will be reported in current period earnings.\nOur capital decreased $1.0 billion or 15 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in capital stock resulting from a decline in member activity. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital\u201d for additional information on our capital.\nCapital\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThis rule may have an effect on member demand for certain advances, but we cannot predict the extent of the impact. To the extent this rule has a material impact on our advance demand, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOn December 27, 2020, the President signed into law an extension of the PPP until March 31, 2021. The April 23, 2020 Supervisory Letter from the Finance Agency allowing FHLBanks to accept PPP loans as collateral remains in effect.\nDuring 2020, we also received a partial recovery of a prior capital distribution from the Financing Corporation in the amount of approximately $26 million, which was credited to unrestricted retained earnings. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Capital.\u201d\nNet interest income totaled $472 million in 2020 compared to $576 million in 2019. Our net interest margin was 0.45 percent during 2020 compared to 0.42 percent during 2019. The $104 million decline in net interest income was primarily impacted by the lower interest rate environment and lower average advance balances, partially offset by an increase in advance prepayment fee income of $66 million compared to the same period in 2019.\nFor additional discussion on items impacting our GAAP earnings, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe do not believe these changes will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur liquidity and capital positions are actively managed in an effort to preserve stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds to meet current and projected future operating financial commitments, as well as regulatory, liquidity, and capital requirements.\n1 Prepayment fees on advances, net includes basis adjustment amortization and premium and/or discount amortization.\nBecause our business model is primarily one of holding assets and liabilities to maturity, management believes that the adjusted earnings measure is helpful in understanding our operating results and provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison of our economic performance in contrast to GAAP results, which can be impacted by fair value changes driven by market volatility on financial instruments recorded at fair value or transactions that are considered to be unpredictable or not routine. As a result, management uses the adjusted earnings measure to assess performance under our incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. While these non-GAAP measures can be used to assist in understanding the components of our earnings, they should not be considered a substitute for results reported under GAAP.\n\u2022using appropriate option valuation models and prepayment estimates or forecasts to describe the evolution of interest rates over time and the expected cash flows of financial instruments in response.\nWe monitor and manage projected 24-month income sensitivity in an effort to limit the short-term earnings volatility of the Bank. The projected 24-month income sensitivity is based on forward interest rates, which allows for negative rates beginning September 30, 2020, business, and risk management assumptions.\nWe continue to evaluate the potential impact of the Supervisory Letter and the related subsequent guidance on our financial condition and results of operations, but we may experience decreased flexibility in our access to funding, higher funding costs, or lower overall demand or increased costs for our advances; which may, in turn, negatively impact our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\n2 These conventional loans were required to have PMI at origination.\n\nOur hedging strategies include hedges of specific assets and liabilities that qualify for fair value hedge accounting and economic hedges that are used to reduce overall market risk exposure. All new hedging strategies are approved by our Asset-Liability Committee. See additional discussion regarding our derivative contracts in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities.\u201d\nAs the spread of COVID-19 increased and the economic impact continued to be negative, the Federal Reserve and Congress implemented a multitude of programs to help stabilize market conditions. The Federal Reserve indicated that it will continue to increase its holdings of U.S. Treasuries and agency MBS, until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.\nSOURCES OF LIQUIDITY\nThe prepayment options embedded in MBS can result in extensions or contractions in the expected maturities of these investments, depending on changes in and levels of interest rates, as well as other factors related to the mortgage market. The Finance Agency limits this source of interest rate risk by restricting the types of MBS we may own to those with limited average life changes under certain interest rate shock scenarios.\nWe offer a wide range of fixed and variable rate advance products with different maturities, interest rates, payment characteristics, and optionality. We may use derivatives to adjust the repricing and/or option characteristics of advances in an effort to manage interest rate risk. For example, we may hedge a fixed rate advance with an interest rate swap where we pay a fixed rate coupon and receive a variable rate coupon, effectively converting the fixed rate advance to a variable rate advance. This type of hedge is typically treated as a fair value hedge. In addition, we may hedge a callable advance, which gives the borrower the option to extinguish the fixed rate advance prior to maturity, by entering into a cancelable interest rate swap.\n\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nWe use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Finance Agency regulations and our risk management policies establish guidelines for derivatives, prohibit trading in or the speculative use of derivatives, and limit credit risk arising from derivatives.\nWe primarily invest in U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, and MBS, and classify them as either trading, AFS, or HTM. The interest rate and prepayment risk associated with these investment securities is managed through a combination of debt issuance and derivatives. We may fund investment securities with fixed rate long-term and callable consolidated obligations or utilize interest rate swaps, caps, floors, or swaptions to manage interest rate risk.\nThe following table categorizes the net effect of hedging activities on net income by product (dollars in millions):\n\nSecond, we are precluded by regulation from redeeming any capital stock without the prior approval of the Finance Agency if either our Board of Directors or the Finance Agency determines that we incurred or are likely to incur losses resulting in or likely to result in a charge against capital.\n4 Average balances reflect the impact of fair value hedging adjustments.\nAdvances\nAmortization/accretion varies from period to period depending on our hedge relationship termination activities and the maturity, call, or prepayment of assets or liabilities previously in hedge relationships. During 2020, we experienced increased amortization activity, primarily due to an increase in prepayments of advances and investments that were previously in a hedge relationship.\n1 Source: The Office of Finance.\nFDIC Brokered Deposits Restrictions\nOur current philosophy is to pay a membership capital stock dividend similar to a reference rate of interest, such as SOFR, and an activity-based capital stock dividend, when possible, at a level above the membership capital stock dividend. Prior to the second quarter of 2020 dividend, we used average three-month LIBOR as our reference rate. Beginning with the second quarter dividend, paid in the third quarter of 2020, we used SOFR as our reference rate.\n\nACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES\n1 Represents either the lowest credit rating available for each counterparty based on an NRSRO, or the guarantor credit rating, if applicable.\nIf we are liquidated, after payment in full to our creditors, our stockholders will be entitled to receive the par value of their capital stock as well as any retained earnings, in an amount proportional to the stockholder's share of the total shares of capital stock. In the event of a merger or consolidation, our Board of Directors shall determine the rights and preferences of our stockholders, subject to applicable Finance Agency regulations, as well as any terms and conditions imposed by the Finance Agency.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of our investments by credit rating (dollars in millions):\n\nNET INTEREST MARGIN\nOn September 27, 2019, the Finance Agency issued a Supervisory Letter to all FHLBanks providing LIBOR transition guidance. The Supervisory Letter stated that by March 31, 2020, the FHLBanks should no longer enter into new financial assets, liabilities, and derivatives that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021 for all product types other than investments. For investments, the Supervisory Letter indicated the FHLBanks, by December 31, 2019, should stop purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021. We ceased purchasing investments that reference LIBOR in 2018. As a result of market volatility triggered in part by COVID-19, on March 16, 2020, the Finance Agency extended from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020 the FHLBanks' ability to enter into new instruments referencing LIBOR that mature after December 31, 2021. As of June 30, 2020, we ceased execution of new LIBOR indexed transactions with maturities beyond December 31, 2021.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, 25 and 31 percent of our advances were variable rate callable advances. Callable advances may be prepaid by borrowers on pertinent dates (call dates) and therefore provide borrowers a source of long-term financing with prepayment flexibility. Interest rates on our variable rate callable advances reset at each call date to be consistent with either the underlying index or our current offering rate in line with our underlying cost of funds. We generally fund our variable rate callable advances with either discount notes or short-term floating rate debt. For additional discussion on our funding strategies, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity - Sources of Liquidity.\u201d\nFair Value Measurements\nFinance Agency Final Rule on FHLBank Housing Goals Amendments\nFinance Agency Final Rule on Stress Testing\nCORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT (CARES ACT)\nReplacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate\nOn April 23, 2020, the Finance Agency issued a Supervisory Letter (PPP Supervisory Letter) permitting the FHLBanks to accept PPP loans as collateral for advances as Agency Securities,\u201d given the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 100 percent guarantee of the unpaid principal balance. On April 20, 2020, the SBA published its third interim final rule related to PPP loans, which explicitly waived certain regulatory requirements that must be satisfied before a member could pledge PPP loans to the FHLBanks as collateral. The PPP Supervisory Letter establishes a series of conditions under which the FHLBanks may accept PPP loans as collateral, which conditions focus on the financial condition of members, collateral discounts, and pledge dollar limits.\nMarket Risk\nThe following table summarizes information on our bonds (dollars in millions):\n\n\u2022understanding the contractual and behavioral features of each instrument;\n\u2022Includes mortgage forbearance provisions and a foreclosure moratorium.\nFINANCE AGENCY SUPERVISORY LETTER - PPP LOANS AS COLLATERAL FOR FHLBANK ADVANCES\n1 Represents the lowest original FICO\u00ae score of the borrowers and co-borrowers.\nOn March 24, 2020, the Finance Agency published a final rule, effective upon issuance, to amend its stress testing rule, consistent with section 401 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (EGRRCPA). The final rule (i) raises the minimum threshold for entities regulated by the Finance Agency to conduct periodic stress tests from $10 billion to $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, (ii) removes the requirements for FHLBanks to conduct stress testing, and (iii) removes the adverse scenario from the list of required scenarios. FHLBanks are currently excluded from this regulation because no FHLBank has total consolidated assets over $250 billion, but the Finance Agency reserved its discretion to require an FHLBank with total consolidated assets below the $250 billion threshold to conduct stress testing. These amendments align the Finance Agency's stress testing rule with rules adopted by other financial institution regulators that implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) stress testing requirements, as amended by EGRRCPA.\nDuring 2020, we recorded other income (loss) of $121 million compared to $20 million during 2019. Other income (loss) was primarily impacted by net gains on litigation settlements of $120 million as a result of settlements with defendants in our private-label MBS litigation. As of December 31, 2020, all private-label litigation cases initially filed have been settled. We did not record any litigation settlements during 2019. Other factors impacting other income (loss) included net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities and net gains (losses) on trading securities, as described below.\n2 Represents secured securities purchased under agreements to resell with no NRSRO or guarantor rating.\nINTEREST RATE PAYMENT TERMS\nOur total liabilities decreased to $82.0 billion at December 31, 2020, from $122.9 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in the amount of consolidated obligations needed to fund our assets.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of our investments (dollars in millions):\nSTATEMENTS OF CONDITION\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n4 Represents amounts recorded in Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d on the Statements of Income.\n4 Adjusted AHP assessments for this non-GAAP measure are calculated as 10 percent of adjusted net income before assessments. For additional discussion on AHP assessments, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Affordable Housing Program.\u201d\nThe Finance Agency limits our investments in MBS by requiring that the balance of our MBS not exceed three times regulatory capital at the time of purchase. At December 31, 2020, our ratio of MBS to regulatory capital was 2.40 compared to 2.12 at December 31, 2019.\n\nThe federal government programs to assist homeowners affected by the pandemic, including temporary mortgage payment forbearance and a temporary moratorium on foreclosures and evictions, remained in place during the fourth quarter of 2020. Forbearances and delinquencies of mortgage loans stabilized and began to trend down in the second half of 2020, consistent with a decline in the rate of unemployment. The federal government programs are set to expire on June 30, 2021, which could result in an increase in delinquencies and foreclosures.\n8 Represents yield on total interest-earning assets minus cost of total interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nOur dividend rates seek to strike a balance between providing reasonable and consistent returns to members while preserving our financial position, flexibility, and ability to serve as a long-term liquidity provider. Our actual dividend is determined quarterly by our Board of Directors, based on policies, regulatory requirements, actual performance, and other considerations that the Board determines to be appropriate.\nOur total mortgage loans decreased $1.1 billion or 12 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to principal paydowns exceeding loan purchases as a result of increased refinancing activity driven by lower rates.\n\u2022fully disbursed whole first mortgages on improved residential real property or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages;\n\u2022Creates a loan program for small businesses, non-profits and physician practices that can be forgiven through employee retention incentives;\nThe following table summarizes information on our mortgage loans held for portfolio (dollars in millions):\n\nWe have risk management policies, established by our Board of Directors, that monitor and control our exposure to market, liquidity, credit, operational, model, information security, compliance, and strategic risk, as well as capital adequacy. Our primary risk management objective is to manage our assets and liabilities in ways that ensure liquidity is available to our members and protect the par redemption value of our capital stock. We periodically evaluate our risk management policies in order to respond to changes in our financial position and general market conditions.\nOn January 31, 2020, the Finance Agency released guidance on risk management of AMA. The guidance communicates the Finance Agency's expectations with respect to an FHLBank's funding of its members through the purchase of eligible mortgage loans and includes expectations that an FHLBank will have board-established limits on AMA portfolios and management-established thresholds to serve as monitoring tools to manage AMA-related risk exposure. The guidance provides that the board of an FHLBank should ensure that the bank serves as a liquidity source for members, and an FHLBank should ensure that its portfolio limits do not result in the FHLBank's acquisition of mortgages from smaller members being crowded out\u201d by the acquisition of mortgages from larger members. The advisory bulletin contains the expectation that the board of an FHLBank should set limits on the size and growth of portfolios and on acquisitions from a single participating financial institution. In addition, the guidance provides that the board of an FHLBank should consider concentration risk in the areas of geographic area, high-balance loans, and in third-party loan originations.\nAn economic hedge is defined as a derivative hedging specific or non-specific underlying assets, liabilities, or firm commitments that does not qualify or was not designated for fair value hedge accounting, but is an acceptable hedging strategy under our risk management program. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as economic hedges are recorded in other income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d with no offsetting fair value adjustments for the underlying assets, liabilities, or firm commitments, unless changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities are normally marked to fair value through earnings (e.g., trading securities and fair value option instruments).\n2 Effective combined annualized dividend rate is paid on total capital stock, including mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\nDiscount Notes\n3 Represents gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items in qualifying hedging relationships. Amounts do not include the amortization of the financing element of off-market derivatives.\nINVESTMENTS\n\u2022Decreased shares of capital stock: Our capital stock balance decreased at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019 due primarily to a decrease in member activity. As we repurchased this capital stock at par, which is below our current MVCS value, our MVCS was positively impacted.\nRefer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities\u201d for additional discussion on our derivatives.\nWe evaluate advances for credit losses on a quarterly basis. We adopted new accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2020. We have never experienced a credit loss on our advances. Based upon our collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on advances, management has determined that there were no expected credit losses on our advances as of December 31, 2020. For the same reasons, we did not record any allowance for credit losses for our advances at December 31, 2019. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 - Advances\u201d for additional information.\nThe following table reflects our funding spreads to U.S. Treasuries (basis points)1:\nThe net settlements of interest receivables and payables related to derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized as adjustments to the interest income or interest expense of the designated hedged item. The net settlements of interest receivables and payables related to derivatives designated as economic hedges are recognized in other income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d\nUnder a blanket pledge agreement, we are granted a security interest in all financial assets of the borrower to fully secure the borrower's obligation. Other than securities and cash deposits, we do not initially take delivery of collateral from blanket agreement borrowers. In the event of a default or a deterioration in the financial condition of a blanket pledge agreement borrower, we have the ability to require delivery of pledged collateral sufficient to secure the borrower's obligation. With respect to non-blanket pledge agreement borrowers that are federally insured, we generally require collateral to be specifically assigned. With respect to non-blanket pledge agreement borrowers that are not federally insured (typically insurance companies, CDFIs, and housing associates), we generally take control of collateral through the delivery of cash, securities, or loans to us or our custodians.\n\n\nOur short-term portfolio may include, but is not limited to, interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury obligations. Our long-term portfolio may include, but is not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, taxable municipal bonds, and MBS. We consider our long-term investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, or the FDIC to be of the highest credit quality and therefore those exposures are not monitored with other unsecured investments. Given the credit quality of our unsecured long-term investments, our unsecured credit risk is primarily in the short-term portfolio.\nThe following table summarizes our advances by type of institution (dollars in millions):\nThe contractual or notional amount of derivatives reflects our involvement in the various classes of financial instruments. Our maximum credit risk is the estimated cost of replacing derivatives if there is a default, minus the value of any related collateral. In determining maximum credit risk, we consider accrued interest receivables and payables as well as our ability to net settle positive and negative positions with the same counterparty and/or clearing agent when netting requirements are met.\n\nBonds\nWe invest in fixed rate mortgage loans and certain mortgage loan purchase commitments with our PFIs that are considered derivatives. We normally hedge these commitments by selling TBA MBS for forward settlement. A TBA represents a forward contract for the sale of MBS at a future agreed upon date for an established price. Upon expiration of the mortgage loan purchase commitment, we purchase the TBA to close the hedged position.\n\n\nINTEREST RATE PAYMENT TERMS\nDIVIDENDS\nWe discontinue fair value hedge accounting prospectively when either (i) we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of a hedged item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate, (ii) the derivative and/or the hedged item expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or (iii) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.\n\u2022Long-haul hedge accounting. The application of long-haul hedge accounting requires us to formally assess (both at the hedge's inception and at least quarterly) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items due to benchmark interest rate changes and whether those derivatives are expected to remain highly effective in future periods. The Bank uses regression analyses to assess the effectiveness of its long-haul hedges.\nBorrowers may pledge collateral to us by executing a blanket pledge agreement, specifically assigning collateral, or placing physical possession of collateral with us or our custodians. We perfect our security interest in all pledged collateral by filing Uniform Commercial Code financing statements or by taking possession or control of the collateral. Under the FHLBank Act, any security interest granted to us by our members, or any affiliates of our members, has priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor), unless those claims and rights would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual purchasers or by parties that have perfected security interests.\n2 Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items in qualifying fair value hedge relationships are reported in net interest income. Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedged items also includes the amortization of the financing element of off-market derivatives.\nThe following table shows our change from base 24-month projected ROACS for index specific shocks based on a two standard deviation of historical monthly changes in spread and associated policy limits at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nWe are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. First, the FHLBank Act requires that we maintain at all times permanent capital greater than or equal to the sum of our credit, market, and operations risk capital requirements, all calculated in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. Only permanent capital, defined as Class B capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock), and retained earnings can satisfy this risk-based capital requirement. Second, the FHLBank Act requires a minimum four percent capital-to-asset ratio, which is defined as total regulatory capital divided by total assets. Total regulatory capital includes all Class B capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) and retained earnings. It does not include accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). Third, the FHLBank Act imposes a five percent minimum leverage ratio, which is defined as the sum of permanent capital weighted 1.5 times and nonpermanent capital weighted 1.0 times, divided by total assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not hold any nonpermanent capital. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with all three of the Finance Agency's regulatory capital requirements.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our mandatorily redeemable capital stock totaled $52 million and $206 million. Our total mandatorily redeemable capital stock balance decreased $154 million at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019 due primarily to the repurchase of capital stock outstanding to captive insurance company members during 2020, driven by repayment of their advance balances.\nIf a hedging activity does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (economic hedge), the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables related to the derivative as well as the fair value gains and losses on the derivative are recorded as a component of other income (loss) in Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities;\u201d however, there is no fair value adjustment for the corresponding asset or liability being hedged unless changes in the fair value of the asset or liability are normally marked to fair value through earnings (i.e., trading securities and fair value option instruments).\nCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nWe record trading securities, AFS securities, derivative assets and liabilities, and certain other assets at fair value on our Statements of Condition on a recurring basis and on occasion, certain impaired mortgage loans held for portfolio on a non-recurring basis. Fair value is a market-based measurement and is defined as the price received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. In general, the transaction price will equal the exit price and, therefore, represent the fair value of the asset or liability at initial recognition. In determining whether a transaction price represents the fair value of the asset or liability at initial recognition, we are required to consider factors specific to the asset or liability, the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, and market participants with whom we would transact in that market.\nCONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS\nThe effects of COVID-19 are rapidly evolving, and the full impact and duration of the virus are unknown. As a result of measures taken to address the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown, interest rates have declined significantly and our financial statements have been adversely impacted. Further, demand for advances decreased significantly as a number of emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve helped facilitate liquidity and support stability in the fixed-income markets and as members experienced substantial deposit growth. The extent of the impact to our future performance will depend upon how long the current conditions persist. For additional information, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Conditions in the Financial Markets - Economy and Financial Markets\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDERIVATIVES\nIf hedging relationships meet certain criteria, including, but not limited to, formal documentation of the fair value hedging relationship and an expectation to be highly effective, they qualify for fair value hedge accounting. At the inception of each fair value hedge transaction, we formally document the hedge relationship and our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value attributable to the hedged risk will be assessed. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to assets and liabilities on the Statements of Condition and firm commitments.\n2 Table excludes investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, or the FDIC.\n\nOther expense totaled $189 million for 2020 compared to $168 million for 2019. The increase in other expense was primarily due to increased pension costs as a result of us making a discretionary contribution of $32 million at the end of the year, offset in part by lower professional fees and other operating expenses.\n\nWe reclassify capital stock subject to redemption from equity to a liability (mandatorily redeemable capital stock) at the time shares meet the definition of a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument. This occurs after a member provides written notice of redemption, gives notice of intention to withdraw from membership, becomes ineligible for continuing membership, or attains non-member status by merger or consolidation, charter termination, or other involuntary termination from membership.\nDERIVATIVES\nAs indicated in the tables that follow, our adjusted net interest income and adjusted net income decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019. The decline was driven by lower adjusted net interest income due primarily to lower average advance balances and the lower interest rate environment.\nThe following tables summarize our variable rate advances, investments, consolidated obligation bonds and derivatives by interest-rate index at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\nThe notional amount of our derivative contracts decreased at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by advance prepayments and a reduction in overall assets and liabilities. Consistent with the move to an alternative benchmark rate other than LIBOR, we started using interest rate swaps based on the federal funds or SOFR OIS rates to hedge our balance sheet during 2020. For additional discussion regarding our use of derivatives, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Derivatives.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuring 2020, we recorded net losses of $48 million on our derivatives and hedging activities compared to net losses of $35 million in 2019. The fair value changes were primarily driven by changes in interest rates which impacted the fair value of interest rate swaps used to economically hedge our investment securities portfolio. These changes were primarily driven by market volatility caused by COVID-19 and the impact it had on interest rates. Accounting rules require all derivatives to be recorded at fair value and therefore we may be subject to income statement volatility. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Hedging Activities\u201d for additional discussion on our derivatives and hedging activities.\nIn light of recent market volatility stemming from COVID-19, we are taking additional steps to monitor our credit risk on investments. These steps include temporarily suspending business to Bank counterparties with increased credit risk and performing additional analysis on our unsecured portfolios. In addition, we continue to monitor market volatility and counterparty ratings, counterparty pricing, news, sovereign and counterparty research, market research and articles, and other COVID-19 analysis.\n\nOur investments decreased $7.0 billion or 18 percent at December 31, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in money market investments of $9.7 billion, as liquidity management was impacted by lower advance demand and other economic impacts of COVID-19.\nEligible collateral includes:\n5 Other investments primarily include U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, taxable municipal bonds, and Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO) bonds.\nWe define information security risk as the risk arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information or information systems. Importantly, this definition includes the security of both digital and non-digital information as well as associated information systems and processes.\nEconomy and Financial Markets\nFunding Spreads\n\u2022Federal funds sold. Unsecured loans of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Banks between financial institutions.\n\nOffsetting Positions\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table shows our 24-month projected ROACS spread to the average projected reference rate and associated policy limits, assuming instantaneous non-parallel shifts in interest rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe following table shows the components of other expense (dollars in millions):\nInvestments\nInterest expense on discount notes decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to the lower interest rate environment and lower average discount note balances driven by a decrease in the amount of consolidated obligations needed to fund our assets. Interest expense on discount notes increased during 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily due to the to the higher interest rate environment on average, partially offset by lower average discount note balances driven by a reduction in total assets.\nIn 2020, we reported net income of $362 million compared to $384 million in 2019. Our net income, calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was driven by net interest income, other income (loss), and other expense.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
