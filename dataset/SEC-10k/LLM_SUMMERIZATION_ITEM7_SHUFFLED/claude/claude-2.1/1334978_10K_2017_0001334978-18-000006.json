MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nFormat of Presentation\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis. Our reportable operating segments are Americas outdoor advertising ( Americas\u201d) and International outdoor advertising ( International\u201d). Our Americas and International segments provide outdoor advertising services in their respective geographic regions using various digital and traditional display types.\nWe manage our operating segments primarily focusing on their operating income, while Corporate expenses, Other operating income (expense), net, Interest expense, Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications, Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates, Other income, net and Income tax benefit (expense) are managed on a total company basis and are, therefore, included only in our discussion of consolidated results.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we reevaluated our segment reporting and determined that our Latin America operations should be managed by our International outdoor leadership team. As such, beginning January 1, 2018, our Latin American operations will be included in our International outdoor segment. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation.\nDescription of Our Business\nOur revenue is derived from selling advertising space on the displays we own or operate in key markets worldwide, consisting primarily of billboards, street furniture and transit displays. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients' advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets, both domestically and internationally.\nManagement typically monitors our business by reviewing the average rates, average revenue per display, occupancy, and inventory levels of each of our display types by market.\nWe own the majority of our advertising displays, which typically are located on sites that we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements. Our advertising contracts with clients typically outline the number of displays reserved, the duration of the advertising campaign and the unit price per display.\nThe significant expenses associated with our operations include direct production, maintenance and installation expenses as well as site lease expenses for land under our displays including revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed amounts payable under our billboard, street furniture and transit display contracts. Our direct production, maintenance and installation expenses include costs for printing, transporting and changing the advertising copy on our displays, the related labor costs, the vinyl costs, electricity costs and the costs for cleaning and maintaining our displays. Vinyl costs vary according to the complexity of the advertising copy and the quantity of displays. Our site lease expenses include lease payments for use of the land under our displays, as well as any revenue-sharing arrangements or minimum guaranteed amounts payable that we may have with the landlords. The terms of our site leases and revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed contracts generally range from one to 20 years.\nAmericas\nOur advertising rates are based on a number of different factors including location, competition, type and size of display, illumination, market and gross ratings points. Gross ratings points are the total number of impressions delivered by a display or group of displays, expressed as a percentage of a market population. The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time. For all of our billboards in the United States, we use independent, third-party auditing companies to verify the number of impressions delivered by a display.\nClient contract terms typically range from four weeks to one year for the majority of our display inventory in the United States. Generally, we own the street furniture structures and are responsible for their construction and maintenance. Contracts for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays and sell advertising space on them are awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law or are negotiated with private transit operators. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years.\nInternational\nSimilar to our Americas business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. The number of impressions delivered by a display, in some countries, is weighted to account for such factors as illumination, proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic. In addition, because our International advertising operations are conducted in foreign markets, including Europe and Asia, management reviews the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis. A constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements.\nOur International display inventory is typically sold to clients through network packages, with client contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks with terms of up to one year available as well. Internationally, contracts with municipal and transit authorities for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays typically provide for terms ranging up to 15 years. The major difference between our International and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts. In our International business, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities in exchange for which we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. A different regulatory environment for billboards and competitive bidding for street furniture and transit display contracts, which constitute a larger portion of our business internationally, may result in higher site lease costs in our International business.\nMacroeconomic Indicators\nOur advertising revenue for our Americas and International segments is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) as advertising spending has historically trended in line with GDP, both domestically and internationally. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, estimated U.S. GDP growth for 2017 was 2.3%. Internationally, our results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as the economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations.\nRelationship with iHeartCommunications\nThere are several agreements which govern our relationship with iHeartCommunications including the Master Agreement, Corporate Services Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Trademark and License Agreement (collectively, the \"Intercompany Agreements\"). iHeartCommunications has the right to terminate these agreements in various circumstances. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no notice of termination of any of these agreements has been received from iHeartCommunications. Our agreements with iHeartCommunications continued under the same terms and conditions subsequent to iHeartCommunications' merger.\nOn March 14, 2018, iHeartMedia, the indirect parent of the Company which owns approximately 89.5% of the Company's outstanding common stock, and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors\u201d), filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases\u201d) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). The Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries did not file voluntary petitions for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code and are not Debtors in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur board of directors has established a Special Committee to consider and review certain transactions between iHeartCommunications and us in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. We have consented to, and the Bankruptcy Court has entered a final order approving, iHeartCommunications' continuing to provide services pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement during the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. We expect iHeartCommunications to continue to provide services to us pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement in the ordinary course of business, until it emerges from Chapter 11 or such arrangements are otherwise addressed through the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases.\nOn March 16, 2018, iHeartMedia and the other Debtors entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the iHeart RSA\u201d) with certain creditors and equityholders. The iHeart RSA contemplates that our business will be separated from iHeartCommunications at the conclusion of the iHeartMedia Chapter 11 Cases. The terms and conditions of the separation will be set forth in a plan of reorganization and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. While we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness, we currently expect that the plan of reorganization will provide for the termination, modification or replacement of the Intercompany Agreements.\nIn accordance with the Master Agreement, our branch managers follow a corporate policy allowing iHeartCommunications to use, without charge, Americas' displays they believe would otherwise be unsold. iHeartCommunications bears the cost of producing the advertising and we bear the costs of installing and removing this advertising.\nUnder the Corporate Services Agreement, iHeartCommunications provides management services to us. These services are charged to us based on actual direct costs incurred or allocated by iHeartCommunications based on headcount, revenue or other factors on a pro rata basis. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $68.7 million, $36.0 million and $30.1 million, respectively, as a component of corporate expenses for these services.\nThe Trademark and License Agreement entitles us to use (1) on a nonexclusive basis, the \"Clear Channel\" trademark and the Clear Channel \"outdoor\" trademark logo with respect to day-to-day operations of our business worldwide and on the Internet, and (2) certain other Clear Channel marks in connection with our business. On February 9, 2017, we entered into a binding option and letter of intent with iHeartMedia granting us a binding option to purchase at fair value the registered trademarks and domain names owned by iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries that incorporate one or more of the words \"Clear\" and/or \"Channel,\" and any translations or derivations of any of the foregoing, together with any goodwill associated therewith. This option is exercisable in our sole and absolute discretion at any time between February 23, 2018 and February 23, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2017, management service expenses included $36.8 million pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, iHeartCommunications' and its subsidiaries held 10,726,917 shares of the Company's Class A common stock and all of the Company's class B common stock, which represented 89.5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock on a fully-diluted basis.\nExecutive Summary\nThe key developments in our business for the year ended December 31, 2017 are summarized below:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consolidated revenue decreased $97.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016.

Revenues and expenses excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements\u201d are calculated by converting the current period's revenues and expenses in local currency to U.S. dollars using average foreign exchange rates for the prior period.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,591,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,688,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>1,402,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,422,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>508,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>143,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>325,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>4,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income, net\n</td> <td>26,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>354,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>232,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>637,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>381,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications\n</td> <td>68,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on Due from iHeartCommunications\n</td> <td>(855,648\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on investments, net\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>(990\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>29,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70,682\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>(907,735\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>280,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76,656\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income (loss)\n</td> <td>(627,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amount attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>12,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to the Company\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(639,716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Revenue\nConsolidated revenue decreased $97.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding an $8.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $106.2 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in consolidated revenue is primarily due to the sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and Canada in 2017, which generated revenue of $13.7 million and $149.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by revenue growth in our International business as a result of new contracts and digital expansion.\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $19.3 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $4.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses decreased $23.3 million during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and Canada in 2017. This decrease was partially offset by higher site lease expense related to new contracts.\nConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $6.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $2.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $9.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016. SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and Canada in 2017.\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses increased $26.2 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.4 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses increased $27.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the $36.7 million trademark license fee paid to iHeartMedia, Inc. (see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements located\nin Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The increase in Corporate expenses is partially offset by a decrease in executive and share-based compensation expense.\nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $11.2 million and $13.0 million incurred in 2017 and 2016, respectively, in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2017, $1.8 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $8.5 million are reported within SG&A and $0.9 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2016, such costs totaled $2.7 million, $7.7 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $18.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the sale of the Australia and Turkey businesses and assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nImpairment Charges\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million during 2017 related to goodwill in one International business. In addition, the Company recognized an impairment of $2.6 million during 2017 in relation to advertising assets that were no longer usable in one country in our International segment. During 2016, we recognized a $7.3 million impairment related to goodwill in one International business. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nOther Operating Income, Net\nOther operating income, net of $26.4 million in 2017 primarily related to the sale in the first quarter of 2017 of the Americas' Indianapolis market in exchange for cash and certain assets in Atlanta, Georgia, resulting in a net gain of $28.9 million, and the $6.8 million gain recognized on the sale of our ownership interest in a joint venture in Belgium during the second quarter of 2017. These gains were partially offset by the $12.1 million loss on the sale in the third quarter 2017 of our Canada business.\nOther operating income, net of $354.7 million in 2016 primarily related to the net gain of $278.3 million on sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the net gain of $127.6 million on sale of our business in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the $56.6 million loss, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments, on the sale of our business in Turkey in the second quarter of 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $6.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to new debt issuances.\nInterest Income on Due From iHeartCommunications\nThe terms of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note provide that any balance above $1.0 billion continues to accrue interest at a rate of 20.0%, while the balance up to $1.0 billion accrues interest at a rate of 9.3% (prior to the amendment to the terms of the Due from iHeartCommunications note on November 29, 2017, the Note accrued interest at 6.5%). Interest income increased $18.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a higher average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, including the impact of the amounts over $1.0 billion accruing interest at 20.0%.\nLoss on Due from iHeartCommunications\nLoss on Due from iHeartCommunications included the $855.6 million impairment of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, which was recorded as a result of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filed by iHeartCommunications.\nGain (loss) on Investments, net\nLoss on investments, net was $1.0 million for 2017. Gain on investments, net was $0.5 million for 2016.\nEquity in Loss of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates of $1.0 million and $1.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, included the loss from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income was $29.8 million for 2017. Other expense was $70.7 million for 2016. These amounts relate primarily to net foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia. However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive income tax legislation, referred to as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% percent to 21% effective January 1, 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new U.S. taxes on certain foreign earnings. To account for the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, generally 21% percent. To determine the impact from the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, we analyzed our cumulative foreign earnings and profits in accordance with the rules provided in the Tax Act. Based upon our preliminary analysis which is not yet complete, we have not recorded income tax expense in the current period for the one-time transition tax due to the net accumulated deficit in our foreign earnings and profits.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 was 30.9% and was primarily impacted by the $228.0 million provisional deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% upon enactment of the Tax Act mentioned above.\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% and was primarily impacted by the deferred tax benefits recorded in the current period for the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and France. The release of the valuation allowance of $32.9 million in the U.S. was primarily due to the taxable income generated from the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and the release of valuation allowance in France of $43.3 million was due to positive evidence that existed related to the Company's ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The deferred tax benefits described above were partially offset by $54.7 million in tax expense attributable to the sale of our business in Australia during the period.`\nAmericas Results of Operations\nOur Americas operating results were as follows:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,256,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,278,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>574,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>570,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>219,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>189,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>297,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmericas revenue decreased $22.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $3.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue decreased $25.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the $17.9 million impact resulting from the sales of non-strategic outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and our Canadian business in the third quarter of 2017. The impact of exchanging our Indianapolis market for cash and assets in Atlanta in the first quarter of 2017 also contributed to the decrease in revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from new and existing airport contracts.\nAmericas direct operating expenses increased $3.8 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses increased $1.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in direct operating expenses was driven primarily by higher site lease expenses related to new and existing airport contracts and print displays, partially offset by the $13.2 million decrease in expense due to the impact of the sales of non-strategic outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and our Canadian business in the third quarter of 2017. Americas SG&A expenses decreased $5.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.0 million impact from\nmovements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG&A expenses decreased $6.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to lower bad debt expense and the $2.5 million impact resulting from the sales of non-strategic outdoor markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale of our Canadian business in the third quarter of 2017, and the exchange of outdoor markets in the first quarter of 2017.\nInternational Results of Operations\nOur International operating results were as follows:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,334,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,410,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>828,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>289,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>131,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInternational revenue decreased $75.5 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $4.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue decreased $80.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in revenue is due to a $117.8 million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016. This was partially offset by growth across other markets including Spain, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and China, primarily from new contracts and digital expansion.\nInternational direct operating expenses decreased $23.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $2.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses decreased $25.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was driven by a $70.3 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the 2016 sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey, partially offset by higher site lease and production expenses primarily in countries experiencing revenue growth. International SG&A expenses decreased $0.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.7 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses decreased $2.3 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $22.6 million decrease resulting from the sale of our businesses in Australia and Turkey, partially offset by higher spending related to growth in certain countries. Included within SG&A expenses is $9.6 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to correct for accounting errors related to the misappropriation of cash identified at our China subsidiary. Such corrections are not considered to be material to the current year or prior year financial results.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $21.5 million primarily due to the sale of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,688,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,806,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>1,422,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,494,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>515,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>117,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>344,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>7,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>354,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,452.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>637,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>374,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications\n</td> <td>50,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on investments, net\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>(1,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>(70,682\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>241,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>(76,656\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49,943\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated loss\n</td> <td>164,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amount attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>23,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to the Company\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(95,981\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Revenue\nConsolidated revenue decreased $117.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding a $47.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $69.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenue is primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses which generated $248.9 million in revenue in 2015 and $123.5 million in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by revenues from new digital assets and new contracts.\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $72.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $29.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses decreased $43.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Lower direct operating expenses was primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses.\nConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $16.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $9.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $6.4 million during 2016 compared to 2015. SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, and were partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses increased $0.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $4.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses increased $5.0 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily resulting from higher litigation costs and higher expenses related to non-cash compensation plans.\nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $13.0 million and $20.3 million incurred in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2016, $2.7 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $7.8 million are reported within SG&A and $2.5 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2015, such costs totaled $9.2 million, $4.3 million, and $6.8 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $31.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized, the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses, as well as the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.\nImpairment Charges\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million during 2016 related to goodwill in one International business. During 2015, we recognized a $21.6 million impairment charge related to billboard permits in one Americas market. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nOther Operating Income (Expense), Net\nOther operating income, net of $354.7 million in 2016 primarily related to the net gain of $278.3 million on sale of nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the net gain of $127.6 million on sale on our business in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the $56.6 million loss, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments, on the sale of our business in Turkey in the second quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, Americas sold nine non-strategic markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $592.3 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida.\nOther operating expense, net of $4.8 million in 2015 primarily related to acquisition/disposition transaction costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $19.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the issuance by Clear Channel International B.V. of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nInterest Income on Due From iHeartCommunications\nInterest income decreased $11.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015 due to the decrease in the average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications note.\nEquity in Loss of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates of $1.7 million and $0.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, included the loss from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther expense was $70.2 million for 2016. Other income was $12.4 million for 2015. These amounts relate primarily to net foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies. The decline in value during 2016 of the British pound against the Euro impacted Euro-denominated notes payable by one of our UK subsidiaries, which was the primary driver of the foreign exchange loss in 2016.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nOur operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia. However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries.\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% and was primarily impacted by the deferred tax benefits recorded in the current period for the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and France. The release of the valuation allowance of $32.9 million in the U.S. was primarily due to the taxable income generated from the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and the release of valuation allowance in France of $43.3 million was due to positive evidence that existed related to the Company's ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The deferred tax benefits described above were partially offset by $54.7 million in tax expense attributable to the sale of our business in Australia during the period.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was (234.7)% and was primarily impacted by the $32.9 million valuation allowance recorded during the period as additional deferred tax expense. The valuation allowance was recorded against a portion of the U.S. Federal and State net operating losses due to the uncertainty of the ability to utilize those losses in future periods. Additionally, the Company recorded additional taxes due to the inability to benefit from losses in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nAmericas Results of Operations\nOur Americas operating results were as follows:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,278,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,349,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>570,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>597,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>225,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>185,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>297,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>313,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmericas revenue decreased $70.6 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.7 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue decreased $62.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue is due to the $102.7 million impact of the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue resulting from these sales was partially offset by increased revenues from digital billboards from new deployments and higher occupancy on existing digital billboards, as well as new airport contracts, and higher revenues in Latin America.\nAmericas direct operating expenses decreased $27.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $3.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses decreased $23.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in direct operating expenses was driven by a $35.4 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher site lease expenses related to new airport contracts. Americas SG&A expenses decreased $7.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $2.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG&A expenses decreased $5.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015.

Excluding the $39.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue decreased $6.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue is due to a $22.7 million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia in the second and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively, as well as lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed. These decreases were partially offset by growth across most of our markets including China, Spain, Sweden, France and Belgium, primarily from new digital assets and new contracts.\nInternational direct operating expenses decreased $45.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $25.4 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses decreased $20.4 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by a $14.6 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia and lower rent expense due to lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed. These decreases were partially offset by higher site lease and production expenses in countries experiencing revenue growth. International SG&A expenses decreased $8.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses decreased $0.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015.

Such corrections are not considered to be material to the prior year financial results.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $13.3 million. Excluding the $5.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $7.8 million primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nReconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Consolidated Operating Income\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>85,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>(4,159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,631\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other (1)\n</td> <td>(148,738\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(121,911\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income (expense), net\n</td> <td>26,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>354,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>637,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Corporate and other includes expenses related to Americas and International and as well as overall executive, administrative and support functions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Share-Based Compensation Expense\nAs of December 31, 2017, there was $13.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements that will vest based on service conditions.

Non-cash items affecting our net loss include impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net, share-based compensation, gain on disposal of operating and fixed assets, equity in (earnings) loss of nonconsolidated affiliates and other reconciling items, net as presented on the face of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to changes in working capital balances, particularly accounts receivable, which was driven primarily by lower revenues and improved collections, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest.\nCash provided by operating activities was $298.9 million in 2015 compared to $348.4 million of cash provided in 2014. Our consolidated net loss included $412.9 million of net non-cash items in 2015. Our consolidated net loss in 2014 included $373.6 million of net non-cash items. Non-cash items affecting our net loss include impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net, share-based compensation, gain on disposal of operating and fixed assets, gain on marketable securities, equity in (earnings) loss of nonconsolidated affiliates, loss on extinguishment of debt, and other reconciling items, net as presented on the face of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to a decrease in net income as well as changes in working capital balances, particularly accounts receivable.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used for investing activities of $175.9 million during 2017 reflected our capital expenditures of $224.2 million. We spent $74.6 million in our Americas segment primarily related to the construction of new advertising structures such as digital displays, $146.4 million in our International segment primarily related to street furniture advertising and digital billboard structures, and $3.2 million by Corporate primarily related to equipment and software. This cash usage was partially offset by $72.0 million of net cash proceeds from the disposals of assets.\nCash provided by investing activities of $551.5 million during 2016 primarily reflected $592.3 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of nine non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas, and the sale of our business in Australia for $195.7 million, net of cash retained by the purchaser and closing costs. Those sale proceeds were partially offset by $229.8 million used for capital expenditures. We spent $81.4 million in our Americas segment primarily related to the construction of new advertising structures such as digital displays, $143.8 million in our International segment primarily related to street furniture advertising structures, and $4.6 million by Corporate primarily related to equipment and software.\nCash used for investing activities of $257.7 million during 2015 reflected our capital expenditures of $218.3 million. We spent $82.2 million in our Americas segment primarily related to the construction of new advertising structures such as digital displays, $132.6 million in our International segment primarily related to street furniture advertising and digital billboard structures, and $3.5 million by Corporate primarily related to equipment and software. Other cash provided by investing activities were $11.3 million of proceeds from sales of other operating and fixed assets.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used for financing activities of $379.5 million during 2017 primarily reflected cash dividends paid in the aggregate amount of $332.8 million and net transfers of $181.9 million in cash to iHeartCommunications, which represents the activity in the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d account, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance by CCIBV of $150.0 million of additional 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020, which were issued at a premium, resulting in $156.0 million in proceeds.\nCash used for financing activities of $726.5 million during 2016 primarily reflected two cash dividends paid in the aggregate amount of $755.5 million, partially offset by net transfers of $45.1 million in cash from iHeartCommunications, which represents the activity in the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d account.\nCash provided by financing activities of $199.1 million during 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds from the issuance of $225.0 million of senior notes by our subsidiary Clear Channel International B.V. We also received $17.0 million in cash from iHeartCommunications, which represents the activity in the Due from/to iHeartCommunications\u201d account.\nOn December 20, 2015, our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of $217.8 million that was paid on January 7, 2016 and was reflected as cash used for financing activities in the first quarter of 2016.\nAnticipated Cash Requirements\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, cash from the intercompany arrangement with iHeartComunications described below and our senior revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had $144.1 million of cash on our balance sheet, including $119.0 million of cash held outside the U.S. by our subsidiaries, a portion of which is held by non-wholly owned subsidiaries or is otherwise subject to certain restrictions and not readily accessible to us. Excess cash from our foreign operations may be transferred to our operations in the United States if needed to fund operations in the United States, subject to the foreseeable cash needs of our foreign operations and the mutual agreement of iHeartCommunications and us. If any excess cash held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund operations in the U.S., we could presently repatriate available funds without a requirement to accrue or pay U.S. taxes as a result of significant deficits, as calculated for tax law purposes, in our foreign earnings and profits, which gives us flexibility to make future cash distributions as non-taxable returns of capital. Additionally, as a result of U.S. tax reform, future dividend distributions from our international subsidiaries are exempt from U.S. federal income tax beginning January 1, 2018.\nOur primary uses of liquidity are for our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, dividends and other funding requirements. Based on our current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets, we believe that cash on hand, cash flows from operations, cash from the intercompany arrangement with iHeartCommunications described below and borrowing capacity under our senior revolving credit facility will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, dividends and other funding requirements, including the debt service on the CCWH Senior Notes, the CCWH Subordinated Notes and the CCIBV Senior Notes, for at least the next 12 months. We believe our long-term plans, which include promoting outdoor media spending, capitalizing on our diverse geographic and product opportunities and the continued deployment of digital\ndisplays, will enable us to continue generating cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our liquidity and funding requirements long term. However, our anticipated results are subject to significant uncertainty. Our ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, special dividend and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and cash from operations. If our future operating performance does not meet our expectations or our plans materially change in an adverse manner or prove to be materially inaccurate, we may need additional financing. We may not be able to secure any such additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we sold our business in Australia for cash proceeds of $195.7 million, net of cash retained by the purchaser and closing costs. In January 2017, we sold our Indianapolis, Indiana outdoor market in exchange for certain assets in Atlanta, Georgia, plus approximately $43.1 million in cash, net of closing costs. On February 23, 2017, we paid a special cash dividend to our stockholders of $282.5 million using proceeds from the sales of certain non-strategic U.S. markets and of our business in Australia. iHeartCommunications received 89.9% or approximately $254.0 million, of the dividend, with the remaining 10.1%, or approximately $28.5 million, paid to our public stockholders. On August 14, 2017, CCIBV, our indirect subsidiary, issued $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020, as additional notes under the indenture governing CCIBV's existing 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020. Partially as a result of these transactions, our cash flows from operations have decreased due to lower revenues and higher interest expense. On October 5, 2017, we made a demand for repayment of $25.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid a special cash dividend of $25.0 million. iHeartCommunications received approximately 89.5%, or approximately $22.4 million, of the proceeds of the dividend through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the remaining approximately 10.5%, or approximately $2.6 million, of the proceeds of the dividend paid to our public stockholders. On October 31, 2017, we made a demand for repayment of $25.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid a special cash dividend of $25.0 million. iHeartCommunications received approximately 89.5%, or approximately $22.4 million, of the proceeds of the dividend through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the remaining approximately 10.5%, or approximately $2.6 million, of the proceeds of the dividend paid to our public stockholders. On January 24, 2018, we made a demand for repayment of $30.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid a special cash dividend of $30.0 million. iHeartCommunications received approximately 89.5%, or approximately $26.8 million, of the proceeds of the dividend through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the remaining approximately 10.5%, or approximately $3.2 million, of the proceeds of the dividend paid to our public stockholders. The payment of these special dividends reduces the amount of cash available to us for future working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements. Future special cash dividends will be dependent upon, among other things, our having sufficient available cash.\nHistorically, repayments of amounts outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note has been a source of liquidity for us. On March 14, 2018, iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and certain of iHeartMedia's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, not including the Company or any of its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. It is still early in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness. As an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications, we do not expect that we will be able to recover all of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note upon the implementation of any plan of reorganization that is ultimately accepted by the requisite creditors and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Consequently, the amounts owed under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note may not continue to be a source of liquidity for us in the future.\nThe settlement of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is expected to be addressed in the plan of reorganization in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. See \"--Promissory Notes with iHeartCommunications.\"\niHeartCommunications provides the day-to-day cash management services for our cash activities and balances in the U.S. We do not have any material committed external sources of capital other than iHeartCommunications, and iHeartCommunications is not required to provide us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements. We have no access to the cash transferred from us to iHeartCommunications under the cash management arrangement. As of December 31, 2017, iHeartCommunications had $267.1 million recorded as Cash and cash equivalents\u201d on its consolidated balance sheets, of which $144.1 million was held by us and our subsidiaries. Pursuant to a final order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, as of March 14, 2018, the actual pre-iHeart bankruptcy balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is frozen, and following March 14, 2018, intercompany allocations that would have been reflected in adjustments to the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note are instead reflected in a new intercompany balance that accrues interest at a rate equal to the interest under the Due from iHeart Communications Note. As a result, iHeartCommunications is continuing to provide the day-to-day cash management services for us during the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and we expect it to continue to do so until such arrangements are addressed through the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. We are an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications with respect to amounts owed under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note. It is still early in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness. We do not expect to recover all of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note upon the implementation of any plan of\nreorganization that is ultimately accepted by the requisite majority of creditors and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. If we do not recognize the expected recovery under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, or if we cannot generate sufficient liquidity from our operations or other sources on a timely basis, we could experience a liquidity shortfall. In addition, any repayments that we received on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note during the one-year preference period prior to the filing of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases may potentially be avoidable as a preference and subject to recovery by the iHeartCommunications bankruptcy estate, which could further exacerbate any liquidity shortfall.\nWe were in compliance with the covenants contained in our material financing agreements as of December 31, 2017. Our ability to comply with the maintenance covenant in our senior secured credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.\nOn August 14, 2017, CCIBV, our indirect subsidiary, issued an additional $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (the New CCIBV Notes\u201d). The New CCIBV Notes were issued as additional notes under the indenture governing CCIBV's existing 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 and were issued at a premium, resulting in $156.0 million in proceeds. The New CCIBV Notes mature on December 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 8.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year.\nWe frequently evaluate strategic opportunities both within and outside our existing lines of business. We expect from time to time to dispose of certain businesses and may pursue acquisitions. These dispositions or acquisitions could be material.\nSources of Capital\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had the following debt outstanding, cash and cash equivalents and amounts due from iHeartCommunications:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings Senior Notes due 2022\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020\n</td> <td>2,200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Revolving Credit Facility due 2018(1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clear Channel International B.V.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $71.2 million of letters of credit outstanding, and $3.8 million of availability, under the senior revolving credit facility.\nWe may from time to time repay our outstanding debt or seek to purchase our outstanding equity securities. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nPromissory Notes with iHeartCommunications\nWe maintain accounts that represent net amounts due to or from iHeartCommunications, which are recorded as Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. On November 29, 2017, we amended the Due from iHeartCommunications Note to extend the maturity date to May 15, 2019 and to increase the interest rate from 6.5% to 9.3%. The accounts represent our revolving promissory note issued by us to iHeartCommunications and the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us, in each case in the face amount of $1.0 billion, or if more or less than such amount, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all advances. The accounts accrue interest pursuant to the terms of the promissory notes and are generally payable on demand or when they mature on May 15, 2019. Included in the accounts are the net activities resulting from day-to-day cash management services provided by iHeartCommunications. Such day-to-day cash management services relate only to our cash activities and balances in the U.S. and exclude any cash activities and balances of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the asset recorded in Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d on our consolidated\nbalance sheet was $212.0 million and $885.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the principal amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note was $1,067.6 million. As a result of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, CCOH recognized a loss of $855.6 million on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note during the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the estimated recoverable amount of the note as of December 31, 2017, based on management's best estimate of the cash settlement amount. As of December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings under the revolving promissory note to iHeartCommunications.\nIn accordance with the terms of the settlement for the derivative litigation filed by our stockholders regarding the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, we established a committee of our board of directors, consisting of our independent and disinterested directors, for the specific purpose of monitoring the Due from iHeartCommunications Note. This committee has the non-exclusive authority to demand payments under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note under certain specified circumstances tied to iHeartCommunications' liquidity or the amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, as long as our board of directors declares a simultaneous dividend equal to the amount so demanded. The committee last made a demand under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note on August 11, 2014. As of May 3, 2018, the committee has the right pursuant to the terms of the settlement of the derivative litigation filed by our stockholders regarding the Due from iHeartCommunications Note but not the obligation, to make a demand on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note; however, as described below, the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is currently frozen and any payment pursuant to such demand would be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court.\nPursuant to an order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, as of March 14, 2018, the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is frozen, and following March 14, 2018, intercompany allocations that would have been reflected in adjustments to the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note are instead reflected in an intercompany balance that accrues interest at a rate equal to the interest under the Due from iHeart Communications Note. Our board of directors has established a special committee consisting of our independent directors (the \"Special Committee\") to consider, review and negotiate certain transactions between iHeartCommunications and CCOH in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and discussions regarding the outcome of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note are ongoing. On March 16, 2018, iHeartMedia and the other Debtors and certain creditors and equity holders entered into the iHeart RSA. The iHeart RSA contemplates that our business will be separated from iHeartCommunications at the conclusion of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and that the Due from iHeartCommunications Note will receive treatment in a form and substance acceptable to the Debtors, to the Company and to certain consenting senior creditors of iHeartCommunications, which treatment will be set forth in a plan of reorganization and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. It is still early in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness. As an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications, we do not expect that we will be able to recover all of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note upon the implementation of any plan of reorganization that is ultimately accepted by the requisite majority of creditors and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. As a result, we recognized a loss of $855.6 million on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note during the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the estimated recoverable amount of the note as of December 31, 2017, based on management's best estimate of the cash settlement amount. Consequently, we may not have the \"Due from iHeartCommunications\" asset available to us in the future as a source of liquidity for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements.\nThe net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $68.9 million, $50.3 million and $61.4 million, respectively. As noted above, on November 29, 2017, the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d account was amended to extend its maturity from December 15, 2017 to May 15, 2019. The note's interest rate was also amended and increased from 6.5% to 9.3%. Any balance above $1.0 billion continues to accrue interest capped at a rate of 20.0%, while the balance up to $1.0 billion will accrue interest at a rate of 9.3%.\nIf we are unable to obtain financing from iHeartCommunications under the intercompany arrangement or pursuant to any recoveries of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note in the Chapter 11 Cases, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks or other lenders, or through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity, strategic relationships or other arrangements at some future date. We may be unable to successfully obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms or at all.\nAs long as the Master Agreement continues to govern the relationship between iHeartCommunications and us, iHeartCommunications will have the option to limit our ability to incur debt or issue equity securities, among other limitations, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. Under the Master Agreement with iHeartCommunications, we are limited in our borrowings from third parties to no more than $400.0 million at any one time outstanding, without the prior written consent of iHeartCommunications.\nCCWH Senior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2017, CCWH senior notes represented $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, which consisted of $735.8 million aggregate principal amount of Series A Senior Notes due 2022 (the Series A CCWH Senior Notes\u201d) and $1,989.2 million aggregate principal amount of Series B CCWH Senior Notes due 2022 (the Series B CCWH Senior Notes\u201d). The CCWH Senior Notes are guaranteed by us, Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. ( CCOI\u201d) and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nThe CCWH Senior Notes are senior obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of CCWH and the guarantees of the CCWH Senior Notes rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors. Interest on the CCWH Senior Notes is payable to the trustee weekly in arrears and to the noteholders on May 15 and November 15 of each year.\nCCWH may redeem the CCWH Senior Notes, in whole or in part at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture governing the CCWH Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither CCOH nor any of its subsidiaries is permitted to make any purchase of, or otherwise effectively cancel or retire any Series A CCWH Senior Notes or Series B CCWH Senior Notes if, after giving effect thereto and, if applicable, any concurrent purchase of or other addition with respect to any Series B CCWH Senior Notes or Series A CCWH Senior Notes, as applicable, the ratio of (a) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series A CCWH Senior Notes to (b) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series B CCWH Senior Notes shall be greater than 0.25, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional debt to persons other than iHeartCommunications and its subsidiaries (other than us) or issue certain preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create liens on its restricted subsidiaries' assets to secure such debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the CCWH Senior Notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, the indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes provides that if CCWH (i) makes an optional redemption of the Series B CCWH Senior Notes or purchases or makes an offer to purchase the Series B CCWH Senior Notes at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an optional redemption or purchase a pro rata amount of the Series A CCWH Senior Notes or (ii) makes an asset sale offer under the indenture governing the Series B CCWH Senior Notes, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an offer to purchase a pro rata amount of Series A CCWH Senior Notes.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes does not include limitations on dividends, distributions, investments or asset sales.\nThe indenture governing the Series B CCWH Senior Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>redeem, repurchase or retire our subordinated debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create liens on its or its restricted subsidiaries' assets to secure debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to it from its restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the CCWH Senior Notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sell certain assets, including capital stock of its subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>designate its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends, redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit us to incur additional indebtedness based on an incurrence test. In order to incur (i) additional indebtedness under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower than 7.0:1 and 5.0:1 for total debt and senior debt, respectively, and (ii) additional indebtedness that is subordinated to the CCWH Senior Notes under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower than 7.0:1 for total debt. The indentures\ncontain certain other exceptions that allow us to incur additional indebtedness. The Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture also permits us to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales after making an asset sale offer if our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) are lower than 7.0:1 and 5.0:1 for total debt and senior debt, respectively. The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture. There are other exceptions in these indentures that allow us to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. The exceptions in the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture that allow us to pay dividends include (i) $525.0 million of dividends made pursuant to general restricted payment baskets and (ii) dividends made using proceeds received upon a demand by us of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us. We have used substantially all of the $525.0 million general restricted payments basket capacity in the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture. The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends.\nOur consolidated leverage ratio, defined as total debt divided by EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) for the preceding four quarters was 8.9:1 at December 31, 2017, and senior leverage ratio, defined as senior debt divided by EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) for the preceding four quarters was 4.6:1 at December 31, 2017. As required by the definition of EBITDA in the CCWH Senior Notes indentures, our EBITDA for the preceding four quarters of $599.8 million is calculated as operating income (loss) before depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and other operating income (expense), net, plus share-based compensation, and is further adjusted for the following: (i) costs incurred in connection with severance, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, retention charges, consulting fees and other permitted activities; (ii) extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual gains or losses or expenses; (iii) non-cash charges; and (iv) various other items. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture.\nThe following table reflects a reconciliation of EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) to operating income and net cash provided by operating activities for the four quarters ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Four Quarters Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less adjustments to EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures):\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs incurred in connection with severance, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, retention charges, consulting fees and other permitted activities\n</td> <td>(12.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual gains or losses or expenses (as referenced in the definition of EBITDA in the CCWH Senior Notes indentures)\n</td> <td>(19.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash charges\n</td> <td>(20.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Depreciation and amortization, Impairment charges, Other operating income, net and Share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>(312.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>232.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation and amortization, Impairment charges, Gain (loss) on disposal of operating and fixed assets and Share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>310.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Interest expense\n</td> <td>(381.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications\n</td> <td>68.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Current income tax expense\n</td> <td>(30.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Other income, net\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile consolidated net loss to net cash provided by operating activities (including Provision for doubtful accounts, Amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net and Other reconciling items, net)\n</td> <td>(17.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in assets and liabilities, net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n</td> <td>(64.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCCWH Senior Subordinated Notes\nAs of December 31, 2017, CCWH Subordinated Notes represented $2.2 billion of aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, which consist of $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Series A Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d) and $1,925.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Series B Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d). Interest on the CCWH Subordinated Notes is payable to the trustee weekly in arrears and to the noteholders on March 15 and September 15 of each year.\nThe CCWH Subordinated Notes are CCWH's senior subordinated obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior subordinated basis by us, CCOI and certain of our other domestic subsidiaries. The CCWH Subordinated Notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior to all of CCWH's existing and future senior debt, including the CCWH Senior Notes, equally with any of CCWH's existing and future senior subordinated debt and ahead of all of CCWH's existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the CCWH Subordinated Notes. The guarantees of the CCWH Subordinated Notes rank junior to each guarantor's existing and future senior debt, including the CCWH Senior Notes, equally with each guarantor's existing and future senior subordinated debt and ahead of each guarantor's existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the guarantees of the CCWH Subordinated Notes.\nCCWH may redeem the CCWH Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture governing the CCWH Subordinated Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Neither us nor any of our subsidiaries is permitted to make any purchase of, or otherwise effectively cancel or retire any Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes or Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes if, after giving effect thereto and, if applicable, any concurrent purchase of or other addition with respect to any Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes or Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes, as applicable, the ratio of (a) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes to (b) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes shall be greater than 0.25, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional debt to persons other than iHeartCommunications and its subsidiaries (other than us) or issue certain preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of CCOH's assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, the indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes provides that if CCWH (i) makes an optional redemption of the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes or purchases or makes an offer to purchase the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an optional redemption or purchase a pro rata amount of the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes or (ii) makes an asset sale offer under the indenture governing the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an offer to purchase a pro rata amount of Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes does not include limitations on dividends, distributions, investments or asset sales.\nThe indenture governing the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sell certain assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends, redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture and Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture restrict CCOH's ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit us to incur additional indebtedness based on an incurrence test. In order to incur additional indebtedness under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower\nthan 7.0:1. The indentures contain certain other exceptions that allow us to incur additional indebtedness. The Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture also permits us to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales after making an asset sale offer if its debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) is lower than 7.0:1. The Series A CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture. There are other exceptions in these indentures that allow us to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. The exceptions in the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture that allow us to pay dividends include (i) $525.0 million of dividends made pursuant to general restricted payment baskets and (ii) dividends made using proceeds received upon a demand by us of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us. We have used substantially all of the $525.0 million general restricted payments basket capacity in the Series B CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes indenture. The Series A CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends.\nCCIBV Senior Notes\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, Clear Channel International B.V., an international subsidiary of ours, issued $150.0 million in additional aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 ( CCIBV Senior Notes\u201d), bringing the total amount outstanding under the CCIBV Senior Notes as of December 31, 2017 to $375.0 million.\nThe CCIBV Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 8.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The CCIBV Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of our International outdoor business's existing and future subsidiaries. The Company does not guarantee or otherwise assume any liability for the CCIBV Senior Notes. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of Clear Channel International B.V., and the guarantees of the notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors of the notes.\nClear Channel International B.V. may redeem the notes, in whole or in part at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.\nThe indenture governing the CCIBV Senior Notes contains covenants that limit Clear Channel International B.V.'s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or sell assets; (iv) create liens on assets; (v) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (vi) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; and (vii) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of Clear Channel International B.V.'s assets.\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility Due 2018\nDuring the third quarter of 2013, we entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million. The revolving credit facility may be used for working capital needs, to issue letters of credit and for other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, and $71.2 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility which reduce availability under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains a springing covenant that requires us to maintain a secured leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of not more than 1.5:1 that is tested at the end of a quarter if availability under the facility is less than 75% of the aggregate commitments under the facility. We were in compliance with the secured leverage ratio covenant as of December 31, 2017.\nOther Debt\nOther debt includes various borrowings and capital leases utilized for general operating purposes. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $2.4 million was outstanding as other debt.\niHeartCommunications' Debt Covenants\nOn March 14, 2018, iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and certain of iHeartMedia's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, not including the Company or any of its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. The filing of the voluntary petitions triggered an event of default under the iHeartCommunications' senior credit facility and other debt agreements. The ability of iHeartCommunications' creditors to seek remedies to enforce their rights under such debt agreements is automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and the creditors' rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nDispositions and Other\nIn January 2017, we sold our Indianapolis, Indiana market in exchange for certain assets in Atlanta, Georgia, plus approximately $43.1 million in cash, net of closing costs. A net gain of $28.9 million was recognized related to the sale.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the Company sold its ownership interest in a joint venture in Canada. As a result, the Company recognized a net loss on sale of $12.1 million, which is included within Other operating income (expense), net.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, Americas outdoor sold nine non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $592.3 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida. We recognized a net gain of $278.3 million related to the sale, which is included within Other operating income (expense), net.\nIn the second quarter of 2016, International outdoor sold its business in Turkey. As a result, we recognized a net loss of $56.6 million, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments that were recognized upon sale of the subsidiaries in Turkey.\nIn the fourth quarter 2016, International outdoor sold its business in Australia for cash proceeds of $195.7 million. As a result, we recognized a net gain of $127.6 million, which is net of $14.6 million in cumulative translation adjustments that were recognized upon the sale of our business in Australia.\nUses of Capital\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas advertising\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International advertising\n</td> <td>146.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital expenditures are not of significant size individually and primarily relate to the ongoing deployment of digital displays and improvements to traditional displays in our Americas segment as well as new billboard and street furniture contracts and renewals of existing contracts in our International segment.\nSee the Contractual Obligations table under Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company's future capital expenditure commitments.\nPart of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as alternatives to traditional methods of displaying our clients' advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets. We believe cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these expenditures because we expect enhanced margins through: (i) lower cost of production as the advertisements will be digital and controlled by a central computer network, (ii) decreased down time on displays because the advertisements will be digitally changed rather than manually posted paper or vinyl on the face of the display, and (iii) incremental revenue through more targeted and time specific advertisements.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. Please see Item 3. Legal Proceedings within Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur short and long term cash requirements include minimum annual guarantees for our street furniture contracts and operating leases. Noncancelable contracts and operating lease requirements are included in our direct operating expenses, which\nhistorically have been satisfied by cash flows from operations. For 2018, we are committed to $143.1 million and $359.2 million for minimum annual guarantees and operating leases, respectively. Our long-term commitments for minimum annual guarantees, operating leases and capital expenditure requirements are included in the table below.\nCertain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five year period. The aggregate of these contingent payments, if performance targets are met, would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations.\nIn addition to the scheduled maturities on debt issued by CCWH and CCIBV, we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts. We lease office space, certain equipment and the majority of the land occupied by our advertising structures under long-term operating leases. Some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses (generally tied to the consumer price index), as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance.\nWe have minimum franchise payments associated with non-cancelable contracts that enable us to display advertising on such media as buses, trains, bus shelters and terminals. The majority of these contracts contain rent provisions that are calculated as the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenue or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment.\nThe scheduled maturities of the CCWH Senior Notes, CCWH Subordinated Notes, CCIBV Senior Notes and other debt outstanding, and our future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable lease agreements, minimum payments under other non-cancelable contracts, capital expenditure commitments and other long-term obligations as of December 31, 2017, are as follows:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Payments due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCWH Senior Notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes\n</td> <td>2,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCIBV Senior Notes\n</td> <td>375,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Long-term Debt\n</td> <td>2,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable operating leases\n</td> <td>2,602,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>608,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>465,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,169,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable contracts\n</td> <td>1,839,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>634,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employment contracts\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>68,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits (2)\n</td> <td>22,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations (3)\n</td> <td>247,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,084,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>801,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,842,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,651,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,789,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Interest payments on long-term debt consist primarily of interest on the CCWH Senior Notes, the CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes and the CCIBV Senior Notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The non-current portion of the unrecognized tax benefits is included in the Thereafter\u201d column as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of additional cash payments, if any, at this time.

Our International segment typically experiences its strongest performance in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. We expect this trend to continue in the future.\nMARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in equity security prices, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe have operations in countries throughout the world. Foreign operations are measured in their local currencies. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations. We believe we mitigate a small portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations with a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our foreign operations reported net income of $6.7 million for year ended December 31, 2017. We estimate a 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased our net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 by $0.7 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have increased our net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 by a corresponding amount.\nThis analysis does not consider the implications that such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the U.S. or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities.\nInflation\nInflation is a factor in the economies in which we do business and we continue to seek ways to mitigate its effect. Inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages, salaries and equipment. Although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable, we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our outdoor display faces.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. This update provides a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2014-09 provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue resulting from contracts with customers and will supersede virtually all of the current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. The Company expects to utilize the full retrospective method. The Company has substantially completed its evaluation of the potential changes from adopting the new standard on its future financial reporting and disclosures, which included reviews of contractual terms for all of the Company's significant revenue streams and the development of an implementation plan. The Company continues to execute on its implementation plan, including detailed policy drafting and training of segment personnel. Based on its evaluation, the Company does not expect material changes to its consolidated revenues, operating income or balance sheets as a result of the implementation of this standard.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new leasing standard presents significant changes to the balance sheets of lessees. Lessor accounting is updated to align with certain changes in the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard which was issued in the third quarter of 2015. The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). This update eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. The standard is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests performed for periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This update mandates that entities will apply the modification accounting guidance if the value, vesting conditions or classification of the award changes. Entities will have to make all of the disclosures about modifications that are required today, in addition to disclosing that compensation expense hasn't changed. Additionally, the new guidance also clarifies that a modification to an award could be significant and therefore require disclosure, even if the modification accounting is not required. The guidance will be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods\nwithin those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates, the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debt based on historical experience for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions.\nIf our agings were to improve or deteriorate resulting in a 10% change in our allowance, we estimated that our bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have changed by approximately $2.2 million.\nLeases\nThe most significant estimates used by management in accounting for leases and the impact of these estimates are as follows:\nExpected lease term Our expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the lease term exceeds 75% of the leased asset's useful life. The expected lease term is also used in determining the depreciable life of the asset. An increase in the expected lease term will increase the probability that a lease may be considered a capital lease and will generally result in higher interest and depreciation expense for a leased property recorded on our balance sheet.\nIncremental borrowing rate The incremental borrowing rate is primarily used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the minimum lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. An increase in the incremental borrowing rate decreases the net present value of the minimum lease payments and reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease.\nFair market value of leased asset The fair market value of leased property is generally estimated based on comparable market data as provided by third-party sources. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair market value of the leased property. A higher fair market value reduces the likelihood that a lease will be considered a capital lease.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including structures and other property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles, are reported at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We estimate the useful lives for various types of advertising structures and other long-lived assets based on our historical experience and our plans regarding how we intend to use those assets. Advertising structures have different lives depending on their nature, with large format bulletins generally having longer depreciable lives and posters and other displays having shorter depreciable lives. Street furniture and transit displays are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or appropriate contractual periods, whichever is shorter. Our experience indicates that the estimated useful lives applied to our portfolio of assets have been reasonable, and we do not expect significant changes to the estimated useful lives\nof our long-lived assets in the future. When we determine that structures or other long-lived assets will be disposed of prior to the end of their useful lives, we estimate the revised useful lives and depreciate the assets over the revised period. We also review long-lived assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. When specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable, the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair market value.\nWe use various assumptions in determining the remaining useful lives of assets to be disposed of prior to the end of their useful lives and in determining the current fair market value of long-lived assets that are determined to be unrecoverable. Estimated useful lives and fair values are sensitive to factors including contractual commitments, regulatory requirements, future expected cash flows, industry growth rates and discount rates, as well as future salvage values. Our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nIf actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.\nAnnual Impairment Test\nThe Company performs its annual impairment test on indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of July 1 of each year.\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our billboard permits, are reviewed annually for possible impairment using the direct valuation method as prescribed in ASC 805-20-S99. Under the direct valuation method, the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was calculated at the market level as prescribed by ASC 350-30-35. Under the direct valuation method, it is assumed that rather than acquiring indefinite-lived intangible assets as a part of a going concern business, the buyer hypothetically obtains indefinite-lived intangible assets and builds a new operation with similar attributes from scratch. Thus, the buyer incurs start-up costs during the build-up phase which are normally associated with going concern value. Initial capital costs are deducted from the discounted cash flows model which results in value that is directly attributable to the indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nOur key assumptions using the direct valuation method are market revenue growth rates, market share, profit margin, duration and profile of the build-up period, estimated start-up capital costs and losses incurred during the build-up period, the risk-adjusted discount rate and terminal values. This data is populated using industry normalized information representing an average asset within a market.\nOn July 1, 2017, we performed our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in no impairment charge\nIn determining the fair value of our billboard permits, the following key assumptions were used:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Industry revenue growth forecasts between 0.5% and 3.5% was used for the initial four-year period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>3.0% revenue growth was assumed beyond the initial four-year period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue was grown over a build-up period, reaching maturity by year 2;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating margins gradually climb to the industry average margin of up to 55.9%, depending on market size, by year 3; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Assumed discount rate of 7.5%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decline in the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions, and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profit margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard permits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,107,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,118,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe estimated fair value of our billboard permits at July 1, 2017 was $3.7 billion while the carrying value was $1.0 billion. The estimated fair value of our billboard permits at July 1, 2016 was $4.0 billion while the carrying value was $1.0 billion.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We test goodwill at interim dates if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit. To the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value, an impairment charge may be required to be recorded.\nThe discounted cash flow approach we use for valuing goodwill as part of the two-step impairment testing approach involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets, discounted to their present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Terminal values are also estimated and discounted to their present value.\nOn July 1, 2017, we performed our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $1.6 million related to one of our International outdoor markets. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used the following assumptions:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected cash flows underlying our business plans for the periods 2017 through 2021. Our cash flow assumptions are based on detailed, multi-year forecasts performed by each of our operating segments, and reflect the advertising outlook across our businesses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash flows beyond 2021 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate, which we estimated at 3.0%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In order to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining fair value; we utilized a discount rate of approximately 8.0% to 11.5% for each of our reporting units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our annual assessment using the assumptions described above, a hypothetical 10% reduction in the estimated fair value in each of our reporting units would not result in a material impairment condition.\nWhile we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decline in the fair value of each of our reportable segments that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profit margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>820,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>780,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTax Provisions\nOur estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or results from the final review of our tax returns by federal, state or foreign tax authorities.\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if the Company believes it is more than likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized.\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our UTBs may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive income tax legislation, referred to as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% percent to 21% effective January 1, 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax\ndeferred, and creates new U.S. taxes on certain foreign earnings. To account for the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, generally 21% percent. To determine the impact from the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, we analyzed our cumulative foreign earnings and profits in accordance with the rules provided in the Tax Act. Based upon our preliminary analysis which is not yet complete, we have not recorded income tax expense in the current period for the one-time transition tax due to the net accumulated deficit in our foreign earnings and profits.\nLitigation Accruals\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Based on current assumptions, we have accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in these assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.\nManagement's estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nASC 410-20 requires us to estimate our obligation upon the termination or nonrenewal of a lease, to dismantle and remove our billboard structures from the leased land and to reclaim the site to its original condition.\nDue to the high rate of lease renewals over a long period of time, our calculation assumes all related assets will be removed at some period over the next 55 years. An estimate of third-party cost information is used with respect to the dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site. The interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on an estimated risk-adjusted credit rate for the same period. If our assumption of the risk-adjusted credit rate used to discount current year additions to the asset retirement obligation decreased approximately 1%, our liability as of December 31, 2017 would not be materially impacted. Similarly, if our assumption of the risk-adjusted credit rate increased approximately 1%, our liability would not be materially impacted.\nShare-Based Compensation\nUnder the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires assumptions and judgments about expected volatility and forfeiture rates, among other factors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, our results of operations could be materially impacted.", "item_7_truncated": "Client contract terms typically range from four weeks to one year for the majority of our display inventory in the United States. Generally, we own the street furniture structures and are responsible for their construction and maintenance. Contracts for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays and sell advertising space on them are awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law or are negotiated with private transit operators. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years.\nOVERVIEW\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Four Quarters Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less adjustments to EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures):\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs incurred in connection with severance, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, retention charges, consulting fees and other permitted activities\n</td> <td>(12.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual gains or losses or expenses (as referenced in the definition of EBITDA in the CCWH Senior Notes indentures)\n</td> <td>(19.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash charges\n</td> <td>(20.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Depreciation and amortization, Impairment charges, Other operating income, net and Share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>(312.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>232.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation and amortization, Impairment charges, Gain (loss) on disposal of operating and fixed assets and Share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>310.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Interest expense\n</td> <td>(381.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications\n</td> <td>68.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Current income tax expense\n</td> <td>(30.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Other income, net\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile consolidated net loss to net cash provided by operating activities (including Provision for doubtful accounts, Amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net and Other reconciling items, net)\n</td> <td>(17.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in assets and liabilities, net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n</td> <td>(64.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have minimum franchise payments associated with non-cancelable contracts that enable us to display advertising on such media as buses, trains, bus shelters and terminals. The majority of these contracts contain rent provisions that are calculated as the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenue or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $31.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized, the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses, as well as the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.\nOur advertising revenue for our Americas and International segments is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) as advertising spending has historically trended in line with GDP, both domestically and internationally. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, estimated U.S. GDP growth for 2017 was 2.3%.

When we determine that structures or other long-lived assets will be disposed of prior to the end of their useful lives, we estimate the revised useful lives and depreciate the assets over the revised period.

Internationally, contracts with municipal and transit authorities for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays typically provide for terms ranging up to 15 years. The major difference between our International and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts. In our International business, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities in exchange for which we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. A different regulatory environment for billboards and competitive bidding for street furniture and transit display contracts, which constitute a larger portion of our business internationally, may result in higher site lease costs in our International business.\nAmericas\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Payments due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCWH Senior Notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes\n</td> <td>2,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCIBV Senior Notes\n</td> <td>375,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Long-term Debt\n</td> <td>2,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable operating leases\n</td> <td>2,602,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>608,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>465,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,169,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable contracts\n</td> <td>1,839,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>634,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employment contracts\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>68,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits (2)\n</td> <td>22,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations (3)\n</td> <td>247,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,084,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>801,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,842,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,651,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,789,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we reevaluated our segment reporting and determined that our Latin America operations should be managed by our International outdoor leadership team.

Excluding the $4.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses decreased $23.3 million during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and Canada in 2017. This decrease was partially offset by higher site lease expense related to new contracts.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our UTBs may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash.\nDue to the high rate of lease renewals over a long period of time, our calculation assumes all related assets will be removed at some period over the next 55 years. An estimate of third-party cost information is used with respect to the dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site. The interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on an estimated risk-adjusted credit rate for the same period. If our assumption of the risk-adjusted credit rate used to discount current year additions to the asset retirement obligation decreased approximately 1%, our liability as of December 31, 2017 would not be materially impacted. Similarly, if our assumption of the risk-adjusted credit rate increased approximately 1%, our liability would not be materially impacted.\n \u2022 In October 2017, we made demands for repayment of $50.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid special cash dividends of $50.0 million. \n \u2022 Assumed discount rate of 7.5%. \nCash provided by operating activities was $298.9 million in 2015 compared to $348.4 million of cash provided in 2014. Our consolidated net loss included $412.9 million of net non-cash items in 2015. Our consolidated net loss in 2014 included $373.6 million of net non-cash items. Non-cash items affecting our net loss include impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net, share-based compensation, gain on disposal of operating and fixed assets, gain on marketable securities, equity in (earnings) loss of nonconsolidated affiliates, loss on extinguishment of debt, and other reconciling items, net as presented on the face of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to a decrease in net income as well as changes in working capital balances, particularly accounts receivable.\nThe following discussion highlights cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nOur capital expenditures are not of significant size individually and primarily relate to the ongoing deployment of digital displays and improvements to traditional displays in our Americas segment as well as new billboard and street furniture contracts and renewals of existing contracts in our International segment.\nAs of December 31, 2017, CCWH Subordinated Notes represented $2.2 billion of aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, which consist of $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Series A Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d) and $1,925.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Series B Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d).

However, our anticipated results are subject to significant uncertainty. Our ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, special dividend and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and cash from operations. If our future operating performance does not meet our expectations or our plans materially change in an adverse manner or prove to be materially inaccurate, we may need additional financing. We may not be able to secure any such additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all.\n \u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt to persons other than iHeartCommunications and its subsidiaries (other than us) or issue certain preferred stock; \n \u2022 Cash flows beyond 2021 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate, which we estimated at 3.0%. \nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $68.9 million, $50.3 million and $61.4 million, respectively. As noted above, on November 29, 2017, the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d account was amended to extend its maturity from December 15, 2017 to May 15, 2019. The note's interest rate was also amended and increased from 6.5% to 9.3%. Any balance above $1.0 billion continues to accrue interest capped at a rate of 20.0%, while the balance up to $1.0 billion will accrue interest at a rate of 9.3%.\ncontain certain other exceptions that allow us to incur additional indebtedness. The Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture also permits us to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales after making an asset sale offer if our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) are lower than 7.0:1 and 5.0:1 for total debt and senior debt, respectively. The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture. There are other exceptions in these indentures that allow us to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. The exceptions in the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture that allow us to pay dividends include (i) $525.0 million of dividends made pursuant to general restricted payment baskets and (ii) dividends made using proceeds received upon a demand by us of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us. We have used substantially all of the $525.0 million general restricted payments basket capacity in the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture. The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends.\nOther operating expense, net of $4.8 million in 2015 primarily related to acquisition/disposition transaction costs.\nCCIBV Senior Notes\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $21.5 million primarily due to the sale of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\n \u2022 Revenue was grown over a build-up period, reaching maturity by year 2; \nConsolidated revenue decreased $97.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding an $8.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $106.2 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in consolidated revenue is primarily due to the sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and Canada in 2017, which generated revenue of $13.7 million and $149.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by revenue growth in our International business as a result of new contracts and digital expansion.\nThe key developments in our business for the year ended December 31, 2017 are summarized below:\nThe indenture governing the CCIBV Senior Notes contains covenants that limit Clear Channel International B.V.'s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or sell assets; (iv) create liens on assets; (v) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (vi) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; and (vii) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of Clear Channel International B.V.'s assets.\nThe estimated fair value of our billboard permits at July 1, 2017 was $3.7 billion while the carrying value was $1.0 billion. The estimated fair value of our billboard permits at July 1, 2016 was $4.0 billion while the carrying value was $1.0 billion.\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\n \u2022 make certain investments; \nIf we are unable to obtain financing from iHeartCommunications under the intercompany arrangement or pursuant to any recoveries of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note in the Chapter 11 Cases, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks or other lenders, or through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity, strategic relationships or other arrangements at some future date. We may be unable to successfully obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms or at all.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nAs of December 31, 2017, iHeartCommunications' and its subsidiaries held 10,726,917 shares of the Company's Class A common stock and all of the Company's class B common stock, which represented 89.5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock on a fully-diluted basis.\nThe settlement of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is expected to be addressed in the plan of reorganization in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. See \"--Promissory Notes with iHeartCommunications.\"\nAmericas Results of Operations\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nHistorically, repayments of amounts outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note has been a source of liquidity for us. On March 14, 2018, iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and certain of iHeartMedia's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, not including the Company or any of its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. It is still early in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness. As an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications, we do not expect that we will be able to recover all of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note upon the implementation of any plan of reorganization that is ultimately accepted by the requisite creditors and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Consequently, the amounts owed under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note may not continue to be a source of liquidity for us in the future.\nInternational revenue decreased $46.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $39.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue decreased $6.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue is due to a $22.7 million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia in the second and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively, as well as lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed. These decreases were partially offset by growth across most of our markets including China, Spain, Sweden, France and Belgium, primarily from new digital assets and new contracts.\nCash used for investing activities of $257.7 million during 2015 reflected our capital expenditures of $218.3 million. We spent $82.2 million in our Americas segment primarily related to the construction of new advertising structures such as digital displays, $132.6 million in our International segment primarily related to street furniture advertising and digital billboard structures, and $3.5 million by Corporate primarily related to equipment and software. Other cash provided by investing activities were $11.3 million of proceeds from sales of other operating and fixed assets.\nreorganization that is ultimately accepted by the requisite majority of creditors and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. If we do not recognize the expected recovery under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, or if we cannot generate sufficient liquidity from our operations or other sources on a timely basis, we could experience a liquidity shortfall. In addition, any repayments that we received on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note during the one-year preference period prior to the filing of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases may potentially be avoidable as a preference and subject to recovery by the iHeartCommunications bankruptcy estate, which could further exacerbate any liquidity shortfall.\nOther debt includes various borrowings and capital leases utilized for general operating purposes. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $2.4 million was outstanding as other debt.\nLitigation Accruals\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nOn July 1, 2017, we performed our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in no impairment charge\n\nCCWH Senior Notes\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We test goodwill at interim dates if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit. To the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value, an impairment charge may be required to be recorded.\nIn determining the fair value of our billboard permits, the following key assumptions were used:\nOther Operating Income (Expense), Net\n (1) Corporate and other includes expenses related to Americas and International and as well as overall executive, administrative and support functions.  Share-Based Compensation Expense\nIn accordance with the Master Agreement, our branch managers follow a corporate policy allowing iHeartCommunications to use, without charge, Americas' displays they believe would otherwise be unsold. iHeartCommunications bears the cost of producing the advertising and we bear the costs of installing and removing this advertising.\nLong-lived assets, including structures and other property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles, are reported at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We estimate the useful lives for various types of advertising structures and other long-lived assets based on our historical experience and our plans regarding how we intend to use those assets. Advertising structures have different lives depending on their nature, with large format bulletins generally having longer depreciable lives and posters and other displays having shorter depreciable lives. Street furniture and transit displays are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or appropriate contractual periods, whichever is shorter. Our experience indicates that the estimated useful lives applied to our portfolio of assets have been reasonable, and we do not expect significant changes to the estimated useful lives\nPromissory Notes with iHeartCommunications\nUnder the Corporate Services Agreement, iHeartCommunications provides management services to us. These services are charged to us based on actual direct costs incurred or allocated by iHeartCommunications based on headcount, revenue or other factors on a pro rata basis. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $68.7 million, $36.0 million and $30.1 million, respectively, as a component of corporate expenses for these services.\nSee the Contractual Obligations table under Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company's future capital expenditure commitments.\nConsolidated Revenue\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the Company sold its ownership interest in a joint venture in Canada. As a result, the Company recognized a net loss on sale of $12.1 million, which is included within Other operating income (expense), net.\nCCWH may redeem the CCWH Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture governing the CCWH Subordinated Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Neither us nor any of our subsidiaries is permitted to make any purchase of, or otherwise effectively cancel or retire any Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes or Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes if, after giving effect thereto and, if applicable, any concurrent purchase of or other addition with respect to any Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes or Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes, as applicable, the ratio of (a) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes to (b) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes shall be greater than 0.25, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\n\nWe maintain accounts that represent net amounts due to or from iHeartCommunications, which are recorded as Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. On November 29, 2017, we amended the Due from iHeartCommunications Note to extend the maturity date to May 15, 2019 and to increase the interest rate from 6.5% to 9.3%. The accounts represent our revolving promissory note issued by us to iHeartCommunications and the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us, in each case in the face amount of $1.0 billion, or if more or less than such amount, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all advances. The accounts accrue interest pursuant to the terms of the promissory notes and are generally payable on demand or when they mature on May 15, 2019. Included in the accounts are the net activities resulting from day-to-day cash management services provided by iHeartCommunications. Such day-to-day cash management services relate only to our cash activities and balances in the U.S. and exclude any cash activities and balances of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the asset recorded in Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d on our consolidated\nLong-lived Assets\nWe frequently evaluate strategic opportunities both within and outside our existing lines of business. We expect from time to time to dispose of certain businesses and may pursue acquisitions. These dispositions or acquisitions could be material.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $18.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the sale of the Australia and Turkey businesses and assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\n \u2022 merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of CCOH's assets.  In addition, the indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes provides that if CCWH (i) makes an optional redemption of the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes or purchases or makes an offer to purchase the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an optional redemption or purchase a pro rata amount of the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes or (ii) makes an asset sale offer under the indenture governing the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an offer to purchase a pro rata amount of Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes.\nIf actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.\nIf our agings were to improve or deteriorate resulting in a 10% change in our allowance, we estimated that our bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have changed by approximately $2.2 million.\nInterest Income on Due From iHeartCommunications\nmovements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG&A expenses decreased $6.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to lower bad debt expense and the $2.5 million impact resulting from the sales of non-strategic outdoor markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale of our Canadian business in the third quarter of 2017, and the exchange of outdoor markets in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe terms of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note provide that any balance above $1.0 billion continues to accrue interest at a rate of 20.0%, while the balance up to $1.0 billion accrues interest at a rate of 9.3% (prior to the amendment to the terms of the Due from iHeartCommunications note on November 29, 2017, the Note accrued interest at 6.5%). Interest income increased $18.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a higher average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, including the impact of the amounts over $1.0 billion accruing interest at 20.0%.\n\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows:\nThe Trademark and License Agreement entitles us to use (1) on a nonexclusive basis, the \"Clear Channel\" trademark and the Clear Channel \"outdoor\" trademark logo with respect to day-to-day operations of our business worldwide and on the Internet, and (2) certain other Clear Channel marks in connection with our business. On February 9, 2017, we entered into a binding option and letter of intent with iHeartMedia granting us a binding option to purchase at fair value the registered trademarks and domain names owned by iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries that incorporate one or more of the words \"Clear\" and/or \"Channel,\" and any translations or derivations of any of the foregoing, together with any goodwill associated therewith. This option is exercisable in our sole and absolute discretion at any time between February 23, 2018 and February 23, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2017, management service expenses included $36.8 million pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates, the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions.\ndeferred, and creates new U.S. taxes on certain foreign earnings. To account for the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, generally 21% percent. To determine the impact from the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, we analyzed our cumulative foreign earnings and profits in accordance with the rules provided in the Tax Act. Based upon our preliminary analysis which is not yet complete, we have not recorded income tax expense in the current period for the one-time transition tax due to the net accumulated deficit in our foreign earnings and profits.\n \u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt to persons other than iHeartCommunications and its subsidiaries (other than us) or issue certain preferred stock; \nOur estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or results from the final review of our tax returns by federal, state or foreign tax authorities.\n \u2022 On November 29, 2017, the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d note was amended to extend its maturity from December 15, 2017 to May 15, 2019.

Excluding a $8.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $106.2 million during 2017 compared to 2016. \n \u2022 pay dividends, redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments.  The Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture and Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture restrict CCOH's ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit us to incur additional indebtedness based on an incurrence test. In order to incur additional indebtedness under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower\nImpairment Charges\nInterest income decreased $11.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015 due to the decrease in the average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications note.\nInternational revenue decreased $75.5 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $4.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue decreased $80.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in revenue is due to a $117.8 million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016. This was partially offset by growth across other markets including Spain, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and China, primarily from new contracts and digital expansion.\nLoss on investments, net was $1.0 million for 2017. Gain on investments, net was $0.5 million for 2016.\nRelationship with iHeartCommunications\nThe indenture governing the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new leasing standard presents significant changes to the balance sheets of lessees. Lessor accounting is updated to align with certain changes in the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard which was issued in the third quarter of 2015. The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $13.0 million and $20.3 million incurred in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2016, $2.7 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $7.8 million are reported within SG&A and $2.5 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2015, such costs totaled $9.2 million, $4.3 million, and $6.8 million, respectively.\nWe may from time to time repay our outstanding debt or seek to purchase our outstanding equity securities. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there was $13.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements that will vest based on service conditions. Based on the terms of the award agreements, this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately three years.\n\nWe have operations in countries throughout the world. Foreign operations are measured in their local currencies. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations. We believe we mitigate a small portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations with a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our foreign operations reported net income of $6.7 million for year ended December 31, 2017. We estimate a 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased our net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 by $0.7 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have increased our net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 by a corresponding amount.\n \u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; \nThe Company performs its annual impairment test on indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of July 1 of each year.\nwithin those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nAmericas revenue decreased $22.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $3.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue decreased $25.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the $17.9 million impact resulting from the sales of non-strategic outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and our Canadian business in the third quarter of 2017. The impact of exchanging our Indianapolis market for cash and assets in Atlanta in the first quarter of 2017 also contributed to the decrease in revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from new and existing airport contracts.\nWhile we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decline in the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions, and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption:\nAmericas Results of Operations\n \u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; \nInterest expense increased $19.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the issuance by Clear Channel International B.V. of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. Please see Item 3. Legal Proceedings within Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair market value of leased asset The fair market value of leased property is generally estimated based on comparable market data as provided by third-party sources. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair market value of the leased property. A higher fair market value reduces the likelihood that a lease will be considered a capital lease.\nThe most significant estimates used by management in accounting for leases and the impact of these estimates are as follows:\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCorporate Expenses\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had the following debt outstanding, cash and cash equivalents and amounts due from iHeartCommunications:\nPursuant to an order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, as of March 14, 2018, the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is frozen, and following March 14, 2018, intercompany allocations that would have been reflected in adjustments to the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note are instead reflected in an intercompany balance that accrues interest at a rate equal to the interest under the Due from iHeart Communications Note. Our board of directors has established a special committee consisting of our independent directors (the \"Special Committee\") to consider, review and negotiate certain transactions between iHeartCommunications and CCOH in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and discussions regarding the outcome of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note are ongoing. On March 16, 2018, iHeartMedia and the other Debtors and certain creditors and equity holders entered into the iHeart RSA. The iHeart RSA contemplates that our business will be separated from iHeartCommunications at the conclusion of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and that the Due from iHeartCommunications Note will receive treatment in a form and substance acceptable to the Debtors, to the Company and to certain consenting senior creditors of iHeartCommunications, which treatment will be set forth in a plan of reorganization and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. It is still early in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness. As an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications, we do not expect that we will be able to recover all of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note upon the implementation of any plan of reorganization that is ultimately accepted by the requisite majority of creditors and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. As a result, we recognized a loss of $855.6 million on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note during the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the estimated recoverable amount of the note as of December 31, 2017, based on management's best estimate of the cash settlement amount. Consequently, we may not have the \"Due from iHeartCommunications\" asset available to us in the future as a source of liquidity for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements.\nOther expense was $70.2 million for 2016. Other income was $12.4 million for 2015. These amounts relate primarily to net foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies. The decline in value during 2016 of the British pound against the Euro impacted Euro-denominated notes payable by one of our UK subsidiaries, which was the primary driver of the foreign exchange loss in 2016.\nMARKET RISK\nIncome Tax Expense\nSimilar to our Americas business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. The number of impressions delivered by a display, in some countries, is weighted to account for such factors as illumination, proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic. In addition, because our International advertising operations are conducted in foreign markets, including Europe and Asia, management reviews the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis. A constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements.\nCertain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five year period. The aggregate of these contingent payments, if performance targets are met, would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations.\nWe own the majority of our advertising displays, which typically are located on sites that we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements. Our advertising contracts with clients typically outline the number of displays reserved, the duration of the advertising campaign and the unit price per display.\nAnticipated Cash Requirements\nCapital Expenditures\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in equity security prices, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation.\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if the Company believes it is more than likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized.\n\nThere are several agreements which govern our relationship with iHeartCommunications including the Master Agreement, Corporate Services Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Trademark and License Agreement (collectively, the \"Intercompany Agreements\"). iHeartCommunications has the right to terminate these agreements in various circumstances. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no notice of termination of any of these agreements has been received from iHeartCommunications. Our agreements with iHeartCommunications continued under the same terms and conditions subsequent to iHeartCommunications' merger.\nASC 410-20 requires us to estimate our obligation upon the termination or nonrenewal of a lease, to dismantle and remove our billboard structures from the leased land and to reclaim the site to its original condition.\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% and was primarily impacted by the deferred tax benefits recorded in the current period for the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and France. The release of the valuation allowance of $32.9 million in the U.S. was primarily due to the taxable income generated from the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and the release of valuation allowance in France of $43.3 million was due to positive evidence that existed related to the Company's ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The deferred tax benefits described above were partially offset by $54.7 million in tax expense attributable to the sale of our business in Australia during the period.\n \u2022 sell certain assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries; \nWhile we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decline in the fair value of each of our reportable segments that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption:\n \u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; \nExecutive Summary\nhistorically have been satisfied by cash flows from operations. For 2018, we are committed to $143.1 million and $359.2 million for minimum annual guarantees and operating leases, respectively. Our long-term commitments for minimum annual guarantees, operating leases and capital expenditure requirements are included in the table below.\n\n (2) The non-current portion of the unrecognized tax benefits is included in the Thereafter\u201d column as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of additional cash payments, if any, at this time. For additional information, see Note 7 included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nDuring the third quarter of 2013, we entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million. The revolving credit facility may be used for working capital needs, to issue letters of credit and for other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, and $71.2 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility which reduce availability under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains a springing covenant that requires us to maintain a secured leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of not more than 1.5:1 that is tested at the end of a quarter if availability under the facility is less than 75% of the aggregate commitments under the facility. We were in compliance with the secured leverage ratio covenant as of December 31, 2017.\nIncremental borrowing rate The incremental borrowing rate is primarily used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the minimum lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. An increase in the incremental borrowing rate decreases the net present value of the minimum lease payments and reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease.\nInflation is a factor in the economies in which we do business and we continue to seek ways to mitigate its effect. Inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages, salaries and equipment. Although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable, we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our outdoor display faces.\n \u2022 designate its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and \nCash provided by operating activities was $310.3 million in 2016 compared to $298.9 million of cash provided in 2015. Our consolidated net income included $121.4 million of non-cash items in 2016. Our consolidated net loss in 2015 included $412.9 million of non-cash items. Non-cash items affecting our net loss include impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net, share-based compensation, gain on disposal of operating and fixed assets, equity in (earnings) loss of nonconsolidated affiliates and other reconciling items, net as presented on the face of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to changes in working capital balances, particularly accounts receivable, which was driven primarily by lower revenues and improved collections, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest.\nDispositions and Other\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility Due 2018\nCash provided by financing activities of $199.1 million during 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds from the issuance of $225.0 million of senior notes by our subsidiary Clear Channel International B.V. We also received $17.0 million in cash from iHeartCommunications, which represents the activity in the Due from/to iHeartCommunications\u201d account.\nReconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Consolidated Operating Income\nConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates of $1.0 million and $1.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, included the loss from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nManagement's estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.\nOur International operating results were as follows:\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This update mandates that entities will apply the modification accounting guidance if the value, vesting conditions or classification of the award changes. Entities will have to make all of the disclosures about modifications that are required today, in addition to disclosing that compensation expense hasn't changed. Additionally, the new guidance also clarifies that a modification to an award could be significant and therefore require disclosure, even if the modification accounting is not required. The guidance will be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods\nThe indenture governing the Series B CCWH Senior Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nThe CCWH Senior Notes are senior obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of CCWH and the guarantees of the CCWH Senior Notes rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors. Interest on the CCWH Senior Notes is payable to the trustee weekly in arrears and to the noteholders on May 15 and November 15 of each year.\nFinancing Activities\nIn January 2017, we sold our Indianapolis, Indiana market in exchange for certain assets in Atlanta, Georgia, plus approximately $43.1 million in cash, net of closing costs. A net gain of $28.9 million was recognized related to the sale.\n \u2022 create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes; \nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. This update provides a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2014-09 provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue resulting from contracts with customers and will supersede virtually all of the current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. The Company expects to utilize the full retrospective method. The Company has substantially completed its evaluation of the potential changes from adopting the new standard on its future financial reporting and disclosures, which included reviews of contractual terms for all of the Company's significant revenue streams and the development of an implementation plan. The Company continues to execute on its implementation plan, including detailed policy drafting and training of segment personnel. Based on its evaluation, the Company does not expect material changes to its consolidated revenues, operating income or balance sheets as a result of the implementation of this standard.\nOther Operating Income, Net\nDescription of Our Business\nTypically, both our Americas and International segments experience their lowest financial performance in the first quarter of the calendar year, with International historically experiencing a loss from operations in that period. Our International segment typically experiences its strongest performance in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. We expect this trend to continue in the future.\nOur primary uses of liquidity are for our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, dividends and other funding requirements. Based on our current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets, we believe that cash on hand, cash flows from operations, cash from the intercompany arrangement with iHeartCommunications described below and borrowing capacity under our senior revolving credit facility will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, dividends and other funding requirements, including the debt service on the CCWH Senior Notes, the CCWH Subordinated Notes and the CCIBV Senior Notes, for at least the next 12 months. We believe our long-term plans, which include promoting outdoor media spending, capitalizing on our diverse geographic and product opportunities and the continued deployment of digital\n \u2022 redeem, repurchase or retire our subordinated debt; \nImpairment Charges\n \u2022 designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and \nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur Americas operating results were as follows:\nConsolidated revenue decreased $117.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding a $47.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $69.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenue is primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses which generated $248.9 million in revenue in 2015 and $123.5 million in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by revenues from new digital assets and new contracts.\n \u2022 3.0% revenue growth was assumed beyond the initial four-year period; \nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $11.2 million and $13.0 million incurred in 2017 and 2016, respectively, in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2017, $1.8 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $8.5 million are reported within SG&A and $0.9 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2016, such costs totaled $2.7 million, $7.7 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $6.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $2.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $9.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016. SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and Canada in 2017.\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% and was primarily impacted by the deferred tax benefits recorded in the current period for the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and France. The release of the valuation allowance of $32.9 million in the U.S. was primarily due to the taxable income generated from the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and the release of valuation allowance in France of $43.3 million was due to positive evidence that existed related to the Company's ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The deferred tax benefits described above were partially offset by $54.7 million in tax expense attributable to the sale of our business in Australia during the period.`\nOn July 1, 2017, we performed our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $1.6 million related to one of our International outdoor markets. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used the following assumptions:\nin Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The increase in Corporate expenses is partially offset by a decrease in executive and share-based compensation expense.\nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\n \u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and \nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nCommitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\nOn December 20, 2015, our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of $217.8 million that was paid on January 7, 2016 and was reflected as cash used for financing activities in the first quarter of 2016.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 was 30.9% and was primarily impacted by the $228.0 million provisional deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% upon enactment of the Tax Act mentioned above.\nIn addition to the scheduled maturities on debt issued by CCWH and CCIBV, we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts. We lease office space, certain equipment and the majority of the land occupied by our advertising structures under long-term operating leases. Some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses (generally tied to the consumer price index), as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance.\nInternational\n \u2022 In order to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining fair value; we utilized a discount rate of approximately 8.0% to 11.5% for each of our reporting units. \nbalance sheet was $212.0 million and $885.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the principal amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note was $1,067.6 million. As a result of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, CCOH recognized a loss of $855.6 million on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note during the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the estimated recoverable amount of the note as of December 31, 2017, based on management's best estimate of the cash settlement amount. As of December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings under the revolving promissory note to iHeartCommunications.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive income tax legislation, referred to as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% percent to 21% effective January 1, 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax\nOther income was $29.8 million for 2017. Other expense was $70.7 million for 2016. These amounts relate primarily to net foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies.\nOur short and long term cash requirements include minimum annual guarantees for our street furniture contracts and operating leases. Noncancelable contracts and operating lease requirements are included in our direct operating expenses, which\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes does not include limitations on dividends, distributions, investments or asset sales.\nCash used for investing activities of $175.9 million during 2017 reflected our capital expenditures of $224.2 million. We spent $74.6 million in our Americas segment primarily related to the construction of new advertising structures such as digital displays, $146.4 million in our International segment primarily related to street furniture advertising and digital billboard structures, and $3.2 million by Corporate primarily related to equipment and software. This cash usage was partially offset by $72.0 million of net cash proceeds from the disposals of assets.\nInflation\n\nOther operating income, net of $354.7 million in 2016 primarily related to the net gain of $278.3 million on sale of nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the net gain of $127.6 million on sale on our business in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the $56.6 million loss, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments, on the sale of our business in Turkey in the second quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, Americas sold nine non-strategic markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $592.3 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida.\nInterest expense increased $6.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to new debt issuances.\nOn March 14, 2018, iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and certain of iHeartMedia's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, not including the Company or any of its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. The filing of the voluntary petitions triggered an event of default under the iHeartCommunications' senior credit facility and other debt agreements. The ability of iHeartCommunications' creditors to seek remedies to enforce their rights under such debt agreements is automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and the creditors' rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nIncluded in 2015 International Outdoor direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses are $8.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 to correct for accounting errors included in the results of our Netherlands subsidiary reported in prior years. Such corrections are not considered to be material to the prior year financial results.\nOther operating income, net of $354.7 million in 2016 primarily related to the net gain of $278.3 million on sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the net gain of $127.6 million on sale of our business in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the $56.6 million loss, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments, on the sale of our business in Turkey in the second quarter of 2016.\nOur International operating results were as follows:\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe were in compliance with the covenants contained in our material financing agreements as of December 31, 2017. Our ability to comply with the maintenance covenant in our senior secured credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.\niHeartCommunications' Debt Covenants\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, cash from the intercompany arrangement with iHeartComunications described below and our senior revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had $144.1 million of cash on our balance sheet, including $119.0 million of cash held outside the U.S. by our subsidiaries, a portion of which is held by non-wholly owned subsidiaries or is otherwise subject to certain restrictions and not readily accessible to us. Excess cash from our foreign operations may be transferred to our operations in the United States if needed to fund operations in the United States, subject to the foreseeable cash needs of our foreign operations and the mutual agreement of iHeartCommunications and us. If any excess cash held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund operations in the U.S., we could presently repatriate available funds without a requirement to accrue or pay U.S. taxes as a result of significant deficits, as calculated for tax law purposes, in our foreign earnings and profits, which gives us flexibility to make future cash distributions as non-taxable returns of capital. Additionally, as a result of U.S. tax reform, future dividend distributions from our international subsidiaries are exempt from U.S. federal income tax beginning January 1, 2018.\nRevenues and expenses excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements\u201d in this Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is presented because management believes that viewing certain financial results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates facilitates period to period comparisons of business performance and provides useful information to investors. Revenues and expenses excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements\u201d are calculated by converting the current period's revenues and expenses in local currency to U.S. dollars using average foreign exchange rates for the prior period.\nOur capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nBased on our annual assessment using the assumptions described above, a hypothetical 10% reduction in the estimated fair value in each of our reporting units would not result in a material impairment condition.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, Americas outdoor sold nine non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $592.3 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida. We recognized a net gain of $278.3 million related to the sale, which is included within Other operating income (expense), net.\nUnder the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires assumptions and judgments about expected volatility and forfeiture rates, among other factors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, our results of operations could be materially impacted.\nCash provided by operating activities was $147.6 million in 2017 compared to $310.3 million of cash provided in 2016. Our consolidated net loss included $840.0 million of non-cash items in 2017. Our consolidated net income in 2016 included $121.4 million of non-cash items. Non-cash items affecting our net loss include impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net, share-based compensation, gain on disposal of operating and fixed assets, loss on Due from iHeartCommunications, (gain) loss on investments, equity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates and other reconciling items, net as presented on the face of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to lower operating income as well as changes in working capital balances, particularly accounts receivable at our International business, which was impacted by slower collections.\nInternational direct operating expenses decreased $45.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $25.4 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses decreased $20.4 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by a $14.6 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia and lower rent expense due to lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed. These decreases were partially offset by higher site lease and production expenses in countries experiencing revenue growth. International SG&A expenses decreased $8.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses decreased $0.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $3.0 million decrease resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\nCCWH Senior Subordinated Notes\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $72.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $29.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses decreased $43.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Lower direct operating expenses was primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses.\nthan 7.0:1. The indentures contain certain other exceptions that allow us to incur additional indebtedness. The Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture also permits us to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales after making an asset sale offer if its debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) is lower than 7.0:1. The Series A CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture. There are other exceptions in these indentures that allow us to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. The exceptions in the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture that allow us to pay dividends include (i) $525.0 million of dividends made pursuant to general restricted payment baskets and (ii) dividends made using proceeds received upon a demand by us of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us. We have used substantially all of the $525.0 million general restricted payments basket capacity in the Series B CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes indenture. The Series A CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends.\nAs long as the Master Agreement continues to govern the relationship between iHeartCommunications and us, iHeartCommunications will have the option to limit our ability to incur debt or issue equity securities, among other limitations, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. Under the Master Agreement with iHeartCommunications, we are limited in our borrowings from third parties to no more than $400.0 million at any one time outstanding, without the prior written consent of iHeartCommunications.\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million during 2016 related to goodwill in one International business. During 2015, we recognized a $21.6 million impairment charge related to billboard permits in one Americas market. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nOur key assumptions using the direct valuation method are market revenue growth rates, market share, profit margin, duration and profile of the build-up period, estimated start-up capital costs and losses incurred during the build-up period, the risk-adjusted discount rate and terminal values. This data is populated using industry normalized information representing an average asset within a market.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was (234.7)% and was primarily impacted by the $32.9 million valuation allowance recorded during the period as additional deferred tax expense. The valuation allowance was recorded against a portion of the U.S. Federal and State net operating losses due to the uncertainty of the ability to utilize those losses in future periods. Additionally, the Company recorded additional taxes due to the inability to benefit from losses in certain foreign jurisdictions.\n \u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; \nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nFormat of Presentation\nThe scheduled maturities of the CCWH Senior Notes, CCWH Subordinated Notes, CCIBV Senior Notes and other debt outstanding, and our future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable lease agreements, minimum payments under other non-cancelable contracts, capital expenditure commitments and other long-term obligations as of December 31, 2017, are as follows:\nInterest Expense\nOn August 14, 2017, CCIBV, our indirect subsidiary, issued an additional $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (the New CCIBV Notes\u201d). The New CCIBV Notes were issued as additional notes under the indenture governing CCIBV's existing 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 and were issued at a premium, resulting in $156.0 million in proceeds. The New CCIBV Notes mature on December 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 8.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn accordance with the terms of the settlement for the derivative litigation filed by our stockholders regarding the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, we established a committee of our board of directors, consisting of our independent and disinterested directors, for the specific purpose of monitoring the Due from iHeartCommunications Note. This committee has the non-exclusive authority to demand payments under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note under certain specified circumstances tied to iHeartCommunications' liquidity or the amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, as long as our board of directors declares a simultaneous dividend equal to the amount so demanded. The committee last made a demand under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note on August 11, 2014. As of May 3, 2018, the committee has the right pursuant to the terms of the settlement of the derivative litigation filed by our stockholders regarding the Due from iHeartCommunications Note but not the obligation, to make a demand on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note; however, as described below, the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is currently frozen and any payment pursuant to such demand would be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nInterest Expense\nCCWH may redeem the CCWH Senior Notes, in whole or in part at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture governing the CCWH Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither CCOH nor any of its subsidiaries is permitted to make any purchase of, or otherwise effectively cancel or retire any Series A CCWH Senior Notes or Series B CCWH Senior Notes if, after giving effect thereto and, if applicable, any concurrent purchase of or other addition with respect to any Series B CCWH Senior Notes or Series A CCWH Senior Notes, as applicable, the ratio of (a) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series A CCWH Senior Notes to (b) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series B CCWH Senior Notes shall be greater than 0.25, subject to certain exceptions.\nAnnual Impairment Test\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\n\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Based on current assumptions, we have accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in these assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.\nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates of $1.7 million and $0.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, included the loss from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nWe evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debt based on historical experience for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions.\n \u2022 sell certain assets, including capital stock of its subsidiaries; \nOur advertising rates are based on a number of different factors including location, competition, type and size of display, illumination, market and gross ratings points. Gross ratings points are the total number of impressions delivered by a display or group of displays, expressed as a percentage of a market population. The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time. For all of our billboards in the United States, we use independent, third-party auditing companies to verify the number of impressions delivered by a display.\nInterest Income on Due From iHeartCommunications\nLoss on Due from iHeartCommunications\nOther operating income, net of $26.4 million in 2017 primarily related to the sale in the first quarter of 2017 of the Americas' Indianapolis market in exchange for cash and certain assets in Atlanta, Georgia, resulting in a net gain of $28.9 million, and the $6.8 million gain recognized on the sale of our ownership interest in a joint venture in Belgium during the second quarter of 2017. These gains were partially offset by the $12.1 million loss on the sale in the third quarter 2017 of our Canada business.\nSEASONALITY\nOperating Activities\nInternational Results of Operations\n \u2022 Industry revenue growth forecasts between 0.5% and 3.5% was used for the initial four-year period; \n \u2022 merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets.  In addition, the indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes provides that if CCWH (i) makes an optional redemption of the Series B CCWH Senior Notes or purchases or makes an offer to purchase the Series B CCWH Senior Notes at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an optional redemption or purchase a pro rata amount of the Series A CCWH Senior Notes or (ii) makes an asset sale offer under the indenture governing the Series B CCWH Senior Notes, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an offer to purchase a pro rata amount of Series A CCWH Senior Notes.\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million during 2017 related to goodwill in one International business. In addition, the Company recognized an impairment of $2.6 million during 2017 in relation to advertising assets that were no longer usable in one country in our International segment. During 2016, we recognized a $7.3 million impairment related to goodwill in one International business. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nLeases\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nUses of Capital\nIn the second quarter of 2016, International outdoor sold its business in Turkey. As a result, we recognized a net loss of $56.6 million, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments that were recognized upon sale of the subsidiaries in Turkey.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we sold our business in Australia for cash proceeds of $195.7 million, net of cash retained by the purchaser and closing costs. In January 2017, we sold our Indianapolis, Indiana outdoor market in exchange for certain assets in Atlanta, Georgia, plus approximately $43.1 million in cash, net of closing costs. On February 23, 2017, we paid a special cash dividend to our stockholders of $282.5 million using proceeds from the sales of certain non-strategic U.S. markets and of our business in Australia. iHeartCommunications received 89.9% or approximately $254.0 million, of the dividend, with the remaining 10.1%, or approximately $28.5 million, paid to our public stockholders. On August 14, 2017, CCIBV, our indirect subsidiary, issued $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020, as additional notes under the indenture governing CCIBV's existing 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020. Partially as a result of these transactions, our cash flows from operations have decreased due to lower revenues and higher interest expense. On October 5, 2017, we made a demand for repayment of $25.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid a special cash dividend of $25.0 million. iHeartCommunications received approximately 89.5%, or approximately $22.4 million, of the proceeds of the dividend through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the remaining approximately 10.5%, or approximately $2.6 million, of the proceeds of the dividend paid to our public stockholders. On October 31, 2017, we made a demand for repayment of $25.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid a special cash dividend of $25.0 million. iHeartCommunications received approximately 89.5%, or approximately $22.4 million, of the proceeds of the dividend through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the remaining approximately 10.5%, or approximately $2.6 million, of the proceeds of the dividend paid to our public stockholders. On January 24, 2018, we made a demand for repayment of $30.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid a special cash dividend of $30.0 million. iHeartCommunications received approximately 89.5%, or approximately $26.8 million, of the proceeds of the dividend through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the remaining approximately 10.5%, or approximately $3.2 million, of the proceeds of the dividend paid to our public stockholders. The payment of these special dividends reduces the amount of cash available to us for future working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements. Future special cash dividends will be dependent upon, among other things, our having sufficient available cash.\nPart of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as alternatives to traditional methods of displaying our clients' advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets. We believe cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these expenditures because we expect enhanced margins through: (i) lower cost of production as the advertisements will be digital and controlled by a central computer network, (ii) decreased down time on displays because the advertisements will be digitally changed rather than manually posted paper or vinyl on the face of the display, and (iii) incremental revenue through more targeted and time specific advertisements.\nThe significant expenses associated with our operations include direct production, maintenance and installation expenses as well as site lease expenses for land under our displays including revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed amounts payable under our billboard, street furniture and transit display contracts. Our direct production, maintenance and installation expenses include costs for printing, transporting and changing the advertising copy on our displays, the related labor costs, the vinyl costs, electricity costs and the costs for cleaning and maintaining our displays. Vinyl costs vary according to the complexity of the advertising copy and the quantity of displays. Our site lease expenses include lease payments for use of the land under our displays, as well as any revenue-sharing arrangements or minimum guaranteed amounts payable that we may have with the landlords. The terms of our site leases and revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed contracts generally range from one to 20 years.\nConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nOther Debt\nThis analysis does not consider the implications that such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the U.S. or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities.\nWe use various assumptions in determining the remaining useful lives of assets to be disposed of prior to the end of their useful lives and in determining the current fair market value of long-lived assets that are determined to be unrecoverable. Estimated useful lives and fair values are sensitive to factors including contractual commitments, regulatory requirements, future expected cash flows, industry growth rates and discount rates, as well as future salvage values. Our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nOn March 14, 2018, iHeartMedia, the indirect parent of the Company which owns approximately 89.5% of the Company's outstanding common stock, and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors\u201d), filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases\u201d) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). The Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries did not file voluntary petitions for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code and are not Debtors in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases.\niHeartCommunications provides the day-to-day cash management services for our cash activities and balances in the U.S. We do not have any material committed external sources of capital other than iHeartCommunications, and iHeartCommunications is not required to provide us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements. We have no access to the cash transferred from us to iHeartCommunications under the cash management arrangement. As of December 31, 2017, iHeartCommunications had $267.1 million recorded as Cash and cash equivalents\u201d on its consolidated balance sheets, of which $144.1 million was held by us and our subsidiaries. Pursuant to a final order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, as of March 14, 2018, the actual pre-iHeart bankruptcy balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is frozen, and following March 14, 2018, intercompany allocations that would have been reflected in adjustments to the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note are instead reflected in a new intercompany balance that accrues interest at a rate equal to the interest under the Due from iHeart Communications Note. As a result, iHeartCommunications is continuing to provide the day-to-day cash management services for us during the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and we expect it to continue to do so until such arrangements are addressed through the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. We are an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications with respect to amounts owed under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note. It is still early in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness. We do not expect to recover all of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note upon the implementation of any plan of\n \u2022 create liens on its or its restricted subsidiaries' assets to secure debt; \nConsolidated Revenue\nWe manage our operating segments primarily focusing on their operating income, while Corporate expenses, Other operating income (expense), net, Interest expense, Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications, Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates, Other income, net and Income tax benefit (expense) are managed on a total company basis and are, therefore, included only in our discussion of consolidated results.\nInternational Results of Operations\n \u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and \n (3) Other long-term obligations consist of $44.8 million related to asset retirement obligations recorded pursuant to ASC 410-20, which assumes the underlying assets will be removed at some period over the next 55 years. Also included in the table is $52.2 million related to retirement plans and $151.0 million related to other long-term obligations with a specific maturity. \nThe discounted cash flow approach we use for valuing goodwill as part of the two-step impairment testing approach involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets, discounted to their present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Terminal values are also estimated and discounted to their present value.\nInternational direct operating expenses decreased $23.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $2.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses decreased $25.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was driven by a $70.3 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the 2016 sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey, partially offset by higher site lease and production expenses primarily in countries experiencing revenue growth. International SG&A expenses decreased $0.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.7 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses decreased $2.3 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $22.6 million decrease resulting from the sale of our businesses in Australia and Turkey, partially offset by higher spending related to growth in certain countries. Included within SG&A expenses is $9.6 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to correct for accounting errors related to the misappropriation of cash identified at our China subsidiary. Such corrections are not considered to be material to the current year or prior year financial results.\nSources of Capital\nManagement typically monitors our business by reviewing the average rates, average revenue per display, occupancy, and inventory levels of each of our display types by market.\nThe CCWH Subordinated Notes are CCWH's senior subordinated obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior subordinated basis by us, CCOI and certain of our other domestic subsidiaries. The CCWH Subordinated Notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior to all of CCWH's existing and future senior debt, including the CCWH Senior Notes, equally with any of CCWH's existing and future senior subordinated debt and ahead of all of CCWH's existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the CCWH Subordinated Notes. The guarantees of the CCWH Subordinated Notes rank junior to each guarantor's existing and future senior debt, including the CCWH Senior Notes, equally with each guarantor's existing and future senior subordinated debt and ahead of each guarantor's existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the guarantees of the CCWH Subordinated Notes.\nOur operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia. However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries.\nAmericas direct operating expenses decreased $27.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $3.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses decreased $23.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in direct operating expenses was driven by a $35.4 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher site lease expenses related to new airport contracts. Americas SG&A expenses decreased $7.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $2.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG&A expenses decreased $5.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was due to a $20.4 million decrease in SG&A expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense related to higher revenues.\nOur operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia. However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries.\n(1) The senior revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $75.0 million (the revolving credit commitment). As of December 31, 2017, we had $71.2 million of letters of credit outstanding, and $3.8 million of availability, under the senior revolving credit facility.\nTax Provisions\nEquity in Loss of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive income tax legislation, referred to as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% percent to 21% effective January 1, 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new U.S. taxes on certain foreign earnings. To account for the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, generally 21% percent. To determine the impact from the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, we analyzed our cumulative foreign earnings and profits in accordance with the rules provided in the Tax Act. Based upon our preliminary analysis which is not yet complete, we have not recorded income tax expense in the current period for the one-time transition tax due to the net accumulated deficit in our foreign earnings and profits.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our billboard permits, are reviewed annually for possible impairment using the direct valuation method as prescribed in ASC 805-20-S99. Under the direct valuation method, the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was calculated at the market level as prescribed by ASC 350-30-35. Under the direct valuation method, it is assumed that rather than acquiring indefinite-lived intangible assets as a part of a going concern business, the buyer hypothetically obtains indefinite-lived intangible assets and builds a new operation with similar attributes from scratch. Thus, the buyer incurs start-up costs during the build-up phase which are normally associated with going concern value. Initial capital costs are deducted from the discounted cash flows model which results in value that is directly attributable to the indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n \u2022 Expected cash flows underlying our business plans for the periods 2017 through 2021. Our cash flow assumptions are based on detailed, multi-year forecasts performed by each of our operating segments, and reflect the advertising outlook across our businesses. \n (1) Interest payments on long-term debt consist primarily of interest on the CCWH Senior Notes, the CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes and the CCIBV Senior Notes. \nInvesting Activities\nEquity in Loss of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nOur consolidated leverage ratio, defined as total debt divided by EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) for the preceding four quarters was 8.9:1 at December 31, 2017, and senior leverage ratio, defined as senior debt divided by EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) for the preceding four quarters was 4.6:1 at December 31, 2017. As required by the definition of EBITDA in the CCWH Senior Notes indentures, our EBITDA for the preceding four quarters of $599.8 million is calculated as operating income (loss) before depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and other operating income (expense), net, plus share-based compensation, and is further adjusted for the following: (i) costs incurred in connection with severance, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, retention charges, consulting fees and other permitted activities; (ii) extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual gains or losses or expenses; (iii) non-cash charges; and (iv) various other items. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture.\nThe CCIBV Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 8.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The CCIBV Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of our International outdoor business's existing and future subsidiaries. The Company does not guarantee or otherwise assume any liability for the CCIBV Senior Notes. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of Clear Channel International B.V., and the guarantees of the notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors of the notes.\nCash used for financing activities of $726.5 million during 2016 primarily reflected two cash dividends paid in the aggregate amount of $755.5 million, partially offset by net transfers of $45.1 million in cash from iHeartCommunications, which represents the activity in the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d account.\nThe following table reflects a reconciliation of EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) to operating income and net cash provided by operating activities for the four quarters ended December 31, 2017:\nAmericas direct operating expenses increased $3.8 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses increased $1.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in direct operating expenses was driven primarily by higher site lease expenses related to new and existing airport contracts and print displays, partially offset by the $13.2 million decrease in expense due to the impact of the sales of non-strategic outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and our Canadian business in the third quarter of 2017. Americas SG&A expenses decreased $5.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.0 million impact from\n \u2022 On August 14, 2017, Clear Channel International B.V. (\"CCIBV\"), our indirect subsidiary, issued $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (the \"New CCIBV Notes\") , as additional notes under the indenture governing CCIBV's existing 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020. \nGain (loss) on Investments, net\nAs of December 31, 2017, CCWH senior notes represented $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, which consisted of $735.8 million aggregate principal amount of Series A Senior Notes due 2022 (the Series A CCWH Senior Notes\u201d) and $1,989.2 million aggregate principal amount of Series B CCWH Senior Notes due 2022 (the Series B CCWH Senior Notes\u201d). The CCWH Senior Notes are guaranteed by us, Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. ( CCOI\u201d) and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nIn the fourth quarter 2016, International outdoor sold its business in Australia for cash proceeds of $195.7 million. As a result, we recognized a net gain of $127.6 million, which is net of $14.6 million in cumulative translation adjustments that were recognized upon the sale of our business in Australia.\nLoss on Due from iHeartCommunications included the $855.6 million impairment of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, which was recorded as a result of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filed by iHeartCommunications.\nOur Americas operating results were as follows:\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $18.9 million. Excluding the $0.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $18.1 million primarily due to the sale of the nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nExpected lease term Our expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the lease term exceeds 75% of the leased asset's useful life. The expected lease term is also used in determining the depreciable life of the asset. An increase in the expected lease term will increase the probability that a lease may be considered a capital lease and will generally result in higher interest and depreciation expense for a leased property recorded on our balance sheet.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $13.3 million. Excluding the $5.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $7.8 million primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nCorporate expenses increased $0.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $4.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses increased $5.0 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily resulting from higher litigation costs and higher expenses related to non-cash compensation plans.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $16.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $9.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $6.4 million during 2016 compared to 2015. SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, and were partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\n \u2022 merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; \nAmericas revenue decreased $70.6 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.7 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue decreased $62.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue is due to the $102.7 million impact of the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue resulting from these sales was partially offset by increased revenues from digital billboards from new deployments and higher occupancy on existing digital billboards, as well as new airport contracts, and higher revenues in Latin America.\n \u2022 During the third quarter of 2017, Americas sold its ownership interest in a joint venture in Canada. As a result, the Company recognized a net loss on sale of $12.1 million. \nShare-based compensation expenses are recorded in corporate expenses and were $9.6 million, $10.3 million and $8.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.", "item_7_text": "Client contract terms typically range from four weeks to one year for the majority of our display inventory in the United States. Generally, we own the street furniture structures and are responsible for their construction and maintenance. Contracts for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays and sell advertising space on them are awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law or are negotiated with private transit operators. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years.\nOVERVIEW\nWe have minimum franchise payments associated with non-cancelable contracts that enable us to display advertising on such media as buses, trains, bus shelters and terminals. The majority of these contracts contain rent provisions that are calculated as the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenue or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $31.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized, the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses, as well as the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.\nOur advertising revenue for our Americas and International segments is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) as advertising spending has historically trended in line with GDP, both domestically and internationally. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, estimated U.S. GDP growth for 2017 was 2.3%. Internationally, our results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as the economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, Clear Channel International B.V., an international subsidiary of ours, issued $150.0 million in additional aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 ( CCIBV Senior Notes\u201d), bringing the total amount outstanding under the CCIBV Senior Notes as of December 31, 2017 to $375.0 million.\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\nof our long-lived assets in the future. When we determine that structures or other long-lived assets will be disposed of prior to the end of their useful lives, we estimate the revised useful lives and depreciate the assets over the revised period. We also review long-lived assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. When specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable, the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair market value.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis. Our reportable operating segments are Americas outdoor advertising ( Americas\u201d) and International outdoor advertising ( International\u201d). Our Americas and International segments provide outdoor advertising services in their respective geographic regions using various digital and traditional display types.\nOur International display inventory is typically sold to clients through network packages, with client contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks with terms of up to one year available as well. Internationally, contracts with municipal and transit authorities for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays typically provide for terms ranging up to 15 years. The major difference between our International and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts. In our International business, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities in exchange for which we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. A different regulatory environment for billboards and competitive bidding for street furniture and transit display contracts, which constitute a larger portion of our business internationally, may result in higher site lease costs in our International business.\nAmericas\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we reevaluated our segment reporting and determined that our Latin America operations should be managed by our International outdoor leadership team. As such, beginning January 1, 2018, our Latin American operations will be included in our International outdoor segment. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation.\n \u2022 create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes; \nOur board of directors has established a Special Committee to consider and review certain transactions between iHeartCommunications and us in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. We have consented to, and the Bankruptcy Court has entered a final order approving, iHeartCommunications' continuing to provide services pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement during the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. We expect iHeartCommunications to continue to provide services to us pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement in the ordinary course of business, until it emerges from Chapter 11 or such arrangements are otherwise addressed through the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases.\n\n \u2022 pay dividends, redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments.  The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit us to incur additional indebtedness based on an incurrence test. In order to incur (i) additional indebtedness under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower than 7.0:1 and 5.0:1 for total debt and senior debt, respectively, and (ii) additional indebtedness that is subordinated to the CCWH Senior Notes under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower than 7.0:1 for total debt. The indentures\n \u2022 make certain investments; \nCash provided by investing activities of $551.5 million during 2016 primarily reflected $592.3 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of nine non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas, and the sale of our business in Australia for $195.7 million, net of cash retained by the purchaser and closing costs. Those sale proceeds were partially offset by $229.8 million used for capital expenditures. We spent $81.4 million in our Americas segment primarily related to the construction of new advertising structures such as digital displays, $143.8 million in our International segment primarily related to street furniture advertising structures, and $4.6 million by Corporate primarily related to equipment and software.\n\nCash used for financing activities of $379.5 million during 2017 primarily reflected cash dividends paid in the aggregate amount of $332.8 million and net transfers of $181.9 million in cash to iHeartCommunications, which represents the activity in the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d account, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance by CCIBV of $150.0 million of additional 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020, which were issued at a premium, resulting in $156.0 million in proceeds.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). This update eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. The standard is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests performed for periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nMacroeconomic Indicators\n \u2022 Operating margins gradually climb to the industry average margin of up to 55.9%, depending on market size, by year 3; and \n\nOn March 16, 2018, iHeartMedia and the other Debtors entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the iHeart RSA\u201d) with certain creditors and equityholders. The iHeart RSA contemplates that our business will be separated from iHeartCommunications at the conclusion of the iHeartMedia Chapter 11 Cases. The terms and conditions of the separation will be set forth in a plan of reorganization and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. While we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness, we currently expect that the plan of reorganization will provide for the termination, modification or replacement of the Intercompany Agreements.\n \u2022 create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the CCWH Senior Notes; \n \u2022 create liens on its restricted subsidiaries' assets to secure such debt; \nCorporate expenses increased $26.2 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.4 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses increased $27.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the $36.7 million trademark license fee paid to iHeartMedia, Inc. (see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements located\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes does not include limitations on dividends, distributions, investments or asset sales.\nGoodwill\nOur revenue is derived from selling advertising space on the displays we own or operate in key markets worldwide, consisting primarily of billboards, street furniture and transit displays. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients' advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets, both domestically and internationally.\nClear Channel International B.V. may redeem the notes, in whole or in part at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $19.3 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $4.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses decreased $23.3 million during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and Canada in 2017. This decrease was partially offset by higher site lease expense related to new contracts.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our UTBs may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash.\nDue to the high rate of lease renewals over a long period of time, our calculation assumes all related assets will be removed at some period over the next 55 years. An estimate of third-party cost information is used with respect to the dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site. The interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on an estimated risk-adjusted credit rate for the same period. If our assumption of the risk-adjusted credit rate used to discount current year additions to the asset retirement obligation decreased approximately 1%, our liability as of December 31, 2017 would not be materially impacted. Similarly, if our assumption of the risk-adjusted credit rate increased approximately 1%, our liability would not be materially impacted.\n \u2022 In October 2017, we made demands for repayment of $50.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid special cash dividends of $50.0 million. \n \u2022 Assumed discount rate of 7.5%. \nCash provided by operating activities was $298.9 million in 2015 compared to $348.4 million of cash provided in 2014. Our consolidated net loss included $412.9 million of net non-cash items in 2015. Our consolidated net loss in 2014 included $373.6 million of net non-cash items. Non-cash items affecting our net loss include impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net, share-based compensation, gain on disposal of operating and fixed assets, gain on marketable securities, equity in (earnings) loss of nonconsolidated affiliates, loss on extinguishment of debt, and other reconciling items, net as presented on the face of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to a decrease in net income as well as changes in working capital balances, particularly accounts receivable.\nThe following discussion highlights cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nOur capital expenditures are not of significant size individually and primarily relate to the ongoing deployment of digital displays and improvements to traditional displays in our Americas segment as well as new billboard and street furniture contracts and renewals of existing contracts in our International segment.\nAs of December 31, 2017, CCWH Subordinated Notes represented $2.2 billion of aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, which consist of $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Series A Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d) and $1,925.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Series B Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d). Interest on the CCWH Subordinated Notes is payable to the trustee weekly in arrears and to the noteholders on March 15 and September 15 of each year.\n \u2022 create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to it from its restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the CCWH Senior Notes; \nCorporate Expenses\ndisplays, will enable us to continue generating cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our liquidity and funding requirements long term. However, our anticipated results are subject to significant uncertainty. Our ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, special dividend and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and cash from operations. If our future operating performance does not meet our expectations or our plans materially change in an adverse manner or prove to be materially inaccurate, we may need additional financing. We may not be able to secure any such additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all.\n \u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt to persons other than iHeartCommunications and its subsidiaries (other than us) or issue certain preferred stock; \n \u2022 Cash flows beyond 2021 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate, which we estimated at 3.0%. \nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $68.9 million, $50.3 million and $61.4 million, respectively. As noted above, on November 29, 2017, the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d account was amended to extend its maturity from December 15, 2017 to May 15, 2019. The note's interest rate was also amended and increased from 6.5% to 9.3%. Any balance above $1.0 billion continues to accrue interest capped at a rate of 20.0%, while the balance up to $1.0 billion will accrue interest at a rate of 9.3%.\ncontain certain other exceptions that allow us to incur additional indebtedness. The Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture also permits us to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales after making an asset sale offer if our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) are lower than 7.0:1 and 5.0:1 for total debt and senior debt, respectively. The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture. There are other exceptions in these indentures that allow us to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. The exceptions in the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture that allow us to pay dividends include (i) $525.0 million of dividends made pursuant to general restricted payment baskets and (ii) dividends made using proceeds received upon a demand by us of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us. We have used substantially all of the $525.0 million general restricted payments basket capacity in the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture. The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends.\nOther operating expense, net of $4.8 million in 2015 primarily related to acquisition/disposition transaction costs.\nCCIBV Senior Notes\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $21.5 million primarily due to the sale of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\n \u2022 Revenue was grown over a build-up period, reaching maturity by year 2; \nConsolidated revenue decreased $97.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding an $8.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $106.2 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in consolidated revenue is primarily due to the sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and Canada in 2017, which generated revenue of $13.7 million and $149.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by revenue growth in our International business as a result of new contracts and digital expansion.\nThe key developments in our business for the year ended December 31, 2017 are summarized below:\nThe indenture governing the CCIBV Senior Notes contains covenants that limit Clear Channel International B.V.'s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or sell assets; (iv) create liens on assets; (v) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (vi) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; and (vii) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of Clear Channel International B.V.'s assets.\nThe estimated fair value of our billboard permits at July 1, 2017 was $3.7 billion while the carrying value was $1.0 billion. The estimated fair value of our billboard permits at July 1, 2016 was $4.0 billion while the carrying value was $1.0 billion.\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\n \u2022 make certain investments; \nIf we are unable to obtain financing from iHeartCommunications under the intercompany arrangement or pursuant to any recoveries of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note in the Chapter 11 Cases, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks or other lenders, or through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity, strategic relationships or other arrangements at some future date. We may be unable to successfully obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms or at all.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nAs of December 31, 2017, iHeartCommunications' and its subsidiaries held 10,726,917 shares of the Company's Class A common stock and all of the Company's class B common stock, which represented 89.5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock on a fully-diluted basis.\nThe settlement of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is expected to be addressed in the plan of reorganization in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. See \"--Promissory Notes with iHeartCommunications.\"\nAmericas Results of Operations\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nHistorically, repayments of amounts outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note has been a source of liquidity for us. On March 14, 2018, iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and certain of iHeartMedia's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, not including the Company or any of its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. It is still early in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness. As an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications, we do not expect that we will be able to recover all of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note upon the implementation of any plan of reorganization that is ultimately accepted by the requisite creditors and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Consequently, the amounts owed under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note may not continue to be a source of liquidity for us in the future.\nInternational revenue decreased $46.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $39.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue decreased $6.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue is due to a $22.7 million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia in the second and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively, as well as lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed. These decreases were partially offset by growth across most of our markets including China, Spain, Sweden, France and Belgium, primarily from new digital assets and new contracts.\nCash used for investing activities of $257.7 million during 2015 reflected our capital expenditures of $218.3 million. We spent $82.2 million in our Americas segment primarily related to the construction of new advertising structures such as digital displays, $132.6 million in our International segment primarily related to street furniture advertising and digital billboard structures, and $3.5 million by Corporate primarily related to equipment and software. Other cash provided by investing activities were $11.3 million of proceeds from sales of other operating and fixed assets.\nreorganization that is ultimately accepted by the requisite majority of creditors and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. If we do not recognize the expected recovery under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, or if we cannot generate sufficient liquidity from our operations or other sources on a timely basis, we could experience a liquidity shortfall. In addition, any repayments that we received on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note during the one-year preference period prior to the filing of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases may potentially be avoidable as a preference and subject to recovery by the iHeartCommunications bankruptcy estate, which could further exacerbate any liquidity shortfall.\nOther debt includes various borrowings and capital leases utilized for general operating purposes. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $2.4 million was outstanding as other debt.\nLitigation Accruals\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nOn July 1, 2017, we performed our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in no impairment charge\n\nCCWH Senior Notes\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We test goodwill at interim dates if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit. To the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value, an impairment charge may be required to be recorded.\nIn determining the fair value of our billboard permits, the following key assumptions were used:\nOther Operating Income (Expense), Net\n (1) Corporate and other includes expenses related to Americas and International and as well as overall executive, administrative and support functions.  Share-Based Compensation Expense\nIn accordance with the Master Agreement, our branch managers follow a corporate policy allowing iHeartCommunications to use, without charge, Americas' displays they believe would otherwise be unsold. iHeartCommunications bears the cost of producing the advertising and we bear the costs of installing and removing this advertising.\nLong-lived assets, including structures and other property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles, are reported at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We estimate the useful lives for various types of advertising structures and other long-lived assets based on our historical experience and our plans regarding how we intend to use those assets. Advertising structures have different lives depending on their nature, with large format bulletins generally having longer depreciable lives and posters and other displays having shorter depreciable lives. Street furniture and transit displays are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or appropriate contractual periods, whichever is shorter. Our experience indicates that the estimated useful lives applied to our portfolio of assets have been reasonable, and we do not expect significant changes to the estimated useful lives\nPromissory Notes with iHeartCommunications\nUnder the Corporate Services Agreement, iHeartCommunications provides management services to us. These services are charged to us based on actual direct costs incurred or allocated by iHeartCommunications based on headcount, revenue or other factors on a pro rata basis. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $68.7 million, $36.0 million and $30.1 million, respectively, as a component of corporate expenses for these services.\nSee the Contractual Obligations table under Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company's future capital expenditure commitments.\nConsolidated Revenue\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the Company sold its ownership interest in a joint venture in Canada. As a result, the Company recognized a net loss on sale of $12.1 million, which is included within Other operating income (expense), net.\nCCWH may redeem the CCWH Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture governing the CCWH Subordinated Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Neither us nor any of our subsidiaries is permitted to make any purchase of, or otherwise effectively cancel or retire any Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes or Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes if, after giving effect thereto and, if applicable, any concurrent purchase of or other addition with respect to any Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes or Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes, as applicable, the ratio of (a) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes to (b) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes shall be greater than 0.25, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\n\nWe maintain accounts that represent net amounts due to or from iHeartCommunications, which are recorded as Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. On November 29, 2017, we amended the Due from iHeartCommunications Note to extend the maturity date to May 15, 2019 and to increase the interest rate from 6.5% to 9.3%. The accounts represent our revolving promissory note issued by us to iHeartCommunications and the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us, in each case in the face amount of $1.0 billion, or if more or less than such amount, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all advances. The accounts accrue interest pursuant to the terms of the promissory notes and are generally payable on demand or when they mature on May 15, 2019. Included in the accounts are the net activities resulting from day-to-day cash management services provided by iHeartCommunications. Such day-to-day cash management services relate only to our cash activities and balances in the U.S. and exclude any cash activities and balances of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.

In addition, the indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes provides that if CCWH (i) makes an optional redemption of the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes or purchases or makes an offer to purchase the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an optional redemption or purchase a pro rata amount of the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes or (ii) makes an asset sale offer under the indenture governing the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an offer to purchase a pro rata amount of Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes.\nIf actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.\nIf our agings were to improve or deteriorate resulting in a 10% change in our allowance, we estimated that our bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have changed by approximately $2.2 million.\nInterest Income on Due From iHeartCommunications\nmovements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG&A expenses decreased $6.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to lower bad debt expense and the $2.5 million impact resulting from the sales of non-strategic outdoor markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale of our Canadian business in the third quarter of 2017, and the exchange of outdoor markets in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe terms of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note provide that any balance above $1.0 billion continues to accrue interest at a rate of 20.0%, while the balance up to $1.0 billion accrues interest at a rate of 9.3% (prior to the amendment to the terms of the Due from iHeartCommunications note on November 29, 2017, the Note accrued interest at 6.5%). Interest income increased $18.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a higher average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, including the impact of the amounts over $1.0 billion accruing interest at 20.0%.\n\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows:\nThe Trademark and License Agreement entitles us to use (1) on a nonexclusive basis, the \"Clear Channel\" trademark and the Clear Channel \"outdoor\" trademark logo with respect to day-to-day operations of our business worldwide and on the Internet, and (2) certain other Clear Channel marks in connection with our business. On February 9, 2017, we entered into a binding option and letter of intent with iHeartMedia granting us a binding option to purchase at fair value the registered trademarks and domain names owned by iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries that incorporate one or more of the words \"Clear\" and/or \"Channel,\" and any translations or derivations of any of the foregoing, together with any goodwill associated therewith. This option is exercisable in our sole and absolute discretion at any time between February 23, 2018 and February 23, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2017, management service expenses included $36.8 million pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates, the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions.\ndeferred, and creates new U.S. taxes on certain foreign earnings. To account for the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, generally 21% percent. To determine the impact from the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, we analyzed our cumulative foreign earnings and profits in accordance with the rules provided in the Tax Act. Based upon our preliminary analysis which is not yet complete, we have not recorded income tax expense in the current period for the one-time transition tax due to the net accumulated deficit in our foreign earnings and profits.\n \u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt to persons other than iHeartCommunications and its subsidiaries (other than us) or issue certain preferred stock; \nOur estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or results from the final review of our tax returns by federal, state or foreign tax authorities.\n \u2022 On November 29, 2017, the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d note was amended to extend its maturity from December 15, 2017 to May 15, 2019. The note's interest rate was also amended and increased from 6.5% to 9.3%. \nCash Flows\n \u2022 merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; \n \u2022 Consolidated revenue decreased $97.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding a $8.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $106.2 million during 2017 compared to 2016. \n \u2022 pay dividends, redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments.  The Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture and Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture restrict CCOH's ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit us to incur additional indebtedness based on an incurrence test. In order to incur additional indebtedness under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower\nImpairment Charges\nInterest income decreased $11.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015 due to the decrease in the average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications note.\nInternational revenue decreased $75.5 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $4.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue decreased $80.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in revenue is due to a $117.8 million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016. This was partially offset by growth across other markets including Spain, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and China, primarily from new contracts and digital expansion.\nLoss on investments, net was $1.0 million for 2017. Gain on investments, net was $0.5 million for 2016.\nRelationship with iHeartCommunications\nThe indenture governing the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new leasing standard presents significant changes to the balance sheets of lessees. Lessor accounting is updated to align with certain changes in the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard which was issued in the third quarter of 2015. The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $13.0 million and $20.3 million incurred in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2016, $2.7 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $7.8 million are reported within SG&A and $2.5 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2015, such costs totaled $9.2 million, $4.3 million, and $6.8 million, respectively.\nWe may from time to time repay our outstanding debt or seek to purchase our outstanding equity securities. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there was $13.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements that will vest based on service conditions. Based on the terms of the award agreements, this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately three years.\n\nWe have operations in countries throughout the world. Foreign operations are measured in their local currencies. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations. We believe we mitigate a small portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations with a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our foreign operations reported net income of $6.7 million for year ended December 31, 2017. We estimate a 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased our net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 by $0.7 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have increased our net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 by a corresponding amount.\n \u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; \nThe Company performs its annual impairment test on indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of July 1 of each year.\nwithin those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nAmericas revenue decreased $22.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $3.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue decreased $25.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the $17.9 million impact resulting from the sales of non-strategic outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and our Canadian business in the third quarter of 2017. The impact of exchanging our Indianapolis market for cash and assets in Atlanta in the first quarter of 2017 also contributed to the decrease in revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from new and existing airport contracts.\nWhile we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decline in the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions, and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption:\nAmericas Results of Operations\n \u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; \nInterest expense increased $19.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the issuance by Clear Channel International B.V. of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. Please see Item 3. Legal Proceedings within Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair market value of leased asset The fair market value of leased property is generally estimated based on comparable market data as provided by third-party sources. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair market value of the leased property. A higher fair market value reduces the likelihood that a lease will be considered a capital lease.\nThe most significant estimates used by management in accounting for leases and the impact of these estimates are as follows:\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCorporate Expenses\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had the following debt outstanding, cash and cash equivalents and amounts due from iHeartCommunications:\nPursuant to an order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, as of March 14, 2018, the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is frozen, and following March 14, 2018, intercompany allocations that would have been reflected in adjustments to the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note are instead reflected in an intercompany balance that accrues interest at a rate equal to the interest under the Due from iHeart Communications Note. Our board of directors has established a special committee consisting of our independent directors (the \"Special Committee\") to consider, review and negotiate certain transactions between iHeartCommunications and CCOH in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and discussions regarding the outcome of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note are ongoing. On March 16, 2018, iHeartMedia and the other Debtors and certain creditors and equity holders entered into the iHeart RSA. The iHeart RSA contemplates that our business will be separated from iHeartCommunications at the conclusion of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and that the Due from iHeartCommunications Note will receive treatment in a form and substance acceptable to the Debtors, to the Company and to certain consenting senior creditors of iHeartCommunications, which treatment will be set forth in a plan of reorganization and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. It is still early in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness. As an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications, we do not expect that we will be able to recover all of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note upon the implementation of any plan of reorganization that is ultimately accepted by the requisite majority of creditors and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. As a result, we recognized a loss of $855.6 million on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note during the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the estimated recoverable amount of the note as of December 31, 2017, based on management's best estimate of the cash settlement amount. Consequently, we may not have the \"Due from iHeartCommunications\" asset available to us in the future as a source of liquidity for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements.\nOther expense was $70.2 million for 2016. Other income was $12.4 million for 2015. These amounts relate primarily to net foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies. The decline in value during 2016 of the British pound against the Euro impacted Euro-denominated notes payable by one of our UK subsidiaries, which was the primary driver of the foreign exchange loss in 2016.\nMARKET RISK\nIncome Tax Expense\nSimilar to our Americas business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. The number of impressions delivered by a display, in some countries, is weighted to account for such factors as illumination, proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic. In addition, because our International advertising operations are conducted in foreign markets, including Europe and Asia, management reviews the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis. A constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements.\nCertain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five year period. The aggregate of these contingent payments, if performance targets are met, would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations.\nWe own the majority of our advertising displays, which typically are located on sites that we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements. Our advertising contracts with clients typically outline the number of displays reserved, the duration of the advertising campaign and the unit price per display.\nAnticipated Cash Requirements\nCapital Expenditures\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in equity security prices, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation.\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if the Company believes it is more than likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized.\n\nThere are several agreements which govern our relationship with iHeartCommunications including the Master Agreement, Corporate Services Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Trademark and License Agreement (collectively, the \"Intercompany Agreements\"). iHeartCommunications has the right to terminate these agreements in various circumstances. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no notice of termination of any of these agreements has been received from iHeartCommunications. Our agreements with iHeartCommunications continued under the same terms and conditions subsequent to iHeartCommunications' merger.\nASC 410-20 requires us to estimate our obligation upon the termination or nonrenewal of a lease, to dismantle and remove our billboard structures from the leased land and to reclaim the site to its original condition.\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% and was primarily impacted by the deferred tax benefits recorded in the current period for the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and France. The release of the valuation allowance of $32.9 million in the U.S. was primarily due to the taxable income generated from the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and the release of valuation allowance in France of $43.3 million was due to positive evidence that existed related to the Company's ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The deferred tax benefits described above were partially offset by $54.7 million in tax expense attributable to the sale of our business in Australia during the period.\n \u2022 sell certain assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries; \nWhile we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decline in the fair value of each of our reportable segments that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption:\n \u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; \nExecutive Summary\nhistorically have been satisfied by cash flows from operations. For 2018, we are committed to $143.1 million and $359.2 million for minimum annual guarantees and operating leases, respectively. Our long-term commitments for minimum annual guarantees, operating leases and capital expenditure requirements are included in the table below.\n\n (2) The non-current portion of the unrecognized tax benefits is included in the Thereafter\u201d column as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of additional cash payments, if any, at this time. For additional information, see Note 7 included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nDuring the third quarter of 2013, we entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million. The revolving credit facility may be used for working capital needs, to issue letters of credit and for other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, and $71.2 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility which reduce availability under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains a springing covenant that requires us to maintain a secured leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of not more than 1.5:1 that is tested at the end of a quarter if availability under the facility is less than 75% of the aggregate commitments under the facility. We were in compliance with the secured leverage ratio covenant as of December 31, 2017.\nIncremental borrowing rate The incremental borrowing rate is primarily used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the minimum lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. An increase in the incremental borrowing rate decreases the net present value of the minimum lease payments and reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease.\nInflation is a factor in the economies in which we do business and we continue to seek ways to mitigate its effect. Inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages, salaries and equipment. Although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable, we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our outdoor display faces.\n \u2022 designate its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and \nCash provided by operating activities was $310.3 million in 2016 compared to $298.9 million of cash provided in 2015. Our consolidated net income included $121.4 million of non-cash items in 2016. Our consolidated net loss in 2015 included $412.9 million of non-cash items. Non-cash items affecting our net loss include impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net, share-based compensation, gain on disposal of operating and fixed assets, equity in (earnings) loss of nonconsolidated affiliates and other reconciling items, net as presented on the face of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to changes in working capital balances, particularly accounts receivable, which was driven primarily by lower revenues and improved collections, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest.\nDispositions and Other\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility Due 2018\nCash provided by financing activities of $199.1 million during 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds from the issuance of $225.0 million of senior notes by our subsidiary Clear Channel International B.V. We also received $17.0 million in cash from iHeartCommunications, which represents the activity in the Due from/to iHeartCommunications\u201d account.\nReconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Consolidated Operating Income\nConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates of $1.0 million and $1.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, included the loss from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nManagement's estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.\nOur International operating results were as follows:\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This update mandates that entities will apply the modification accounting guidance if the value, vesting conditions or classification of the award changes. Entities will have to make all of the disclosures about modifications that are required today, in addition to disclosing that compensation expense hasn't changed. Additionally, the new guidance also clarifies that a modification to an award could be significant and therefore require disclosure, even if the modification accounting is not required. The guidance will be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods\nThe indenture governing the Series B CCWH Senior Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nThe CCWH Senior Notes are senior obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of CCWH and the guarantees of the CCWH Senior Notes rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors. Interest on the CCWH Senior Notes is payable to the trustee weekly in arrears and to the noteholders on May 15 and November 15 of each year.\nFinancing Activities\nIn January 2017, we sold our Indianapolis, Indiana market in exchange for certain assets in Atlanta, Georgia, plus approximately $43.1 million in cash, net of closing costs. A net gain of $28.9 million was recognized related to the sale.\n \u2022 create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes; \nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. This update provides a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2014-09 provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue resulting from contracts with customers and will supersede virtually all of the current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. The Company expects to utilize the full retrospective method. The Company has substantially completed its evaluation of the potential changes from adopting the new standard on its future financial reporting and disclosures, which included reviews of contractual terms for all of the Company's significant revenue streams and the development of an implementation plan. The Company continues to execute on its implementation plan, including detailed policy drafting and training of segment personnel. Based on its evaluation, the Company does not expect material changes to its consolidated revenues, operating income or balance sheets as a result of the implementation of this standard.\nOther Operating Income, Net\nDescription of Our Business\nTypically, both our Americas and International segments experience their lowest financial performance in the first quarter of the calendar year, with International historically experiencing a loss from operations in that period. Our International segment typically experiences its strongest performance in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. We expect this trend to continue in the future.\nOur primary uses of liquidity are for our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, dividends and other funding requirements. Based on our current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets, we believe that cash on hand, cash flows from operations, cash from the intercompany arrangement with iHeartCommunications described below and borrowing capacity under our senior revolving credit facility will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, dividends and other funding requirements, including the debt service on the CCWH Senior Notes, the CCWH Subordinated Notes and the CCIBV Senior Notes, for at least the next 12 months. We believe our long-term plans, which include promoting outdoor media spending, capitalizing on our diverse geographic and product opportunities and the continued deployment of digital\n \u2022 redeem, repurchase or retire our subordinated debt; \nImpairment Charges\n \u2022 designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and \nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur Americas operating results were as follows:\nConsolidated revenue decreased $117.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding a $47.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $69.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenue is primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses which generated $248.9 million in revenue in 2015 and $123.5 million in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by revenues from new digital assets and new contracts.\n \u2022 3.0% revenue growth was assumed beyond the initial four-year period; \nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $11.2 million and $13.0 million incurred in 2017 and 2016, respectively, in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2017, $1.8 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $8.5 million are reported within SG&A and $0.9 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2016, such costs totaled $2.7 million, $7.7 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $6.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $2.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $9.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016. SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey in 2016 and Canada in 2017.\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% and was primarily impacted by the deferred tax benefits recorded in the current period for the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and France. The release of the valuation allowance of $32.9 million in the U.S. was primarily due to the taxable income generated from the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and the release of valuation allowance in France of $43.3 million was due to positive evidence that existed related to the Company's ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The deferred tax benefits described above were partially offset by $54.7 million in tax expense attributable to the sale of our business in Australia during the period.`\nOn July 1, 2017, we performed our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $1.6 million related to one of our International outdoor markets. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used the following assumptions:\nin Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The increase in Corporate expenses is partially offset by a decrease in executive and share-based compensation expense.\nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\n \u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and \nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nCommitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\nOn December 20, 2015, our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of $217.8 million that was paid on January 7, 2016 and was reflected as cash used for financing activities in the first quarter of 2016.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 was 30.9% and was primarily impacted by the $228.0 million provisional deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% upon enactment of the Tax Act mentioned above.\nIn addition to the scheduled maturities on debt issued by CCWH and CCIBV, we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts. We lease office space, certain equipment and the majority of the land occupied by our advertising structures under long-term operating leases. Some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses (generally tied to the consumer price index), as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance.\nInternational\n \u2022 In order to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining fair value; we utilized a discount rate of approximately 8.0% to 11.5% for each of our reporting units. \nbalance sheet was $212.0 million and $885.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the principal amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note was $1,067.6 million. As a result of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, CCOH recognized a loss of $855.6 million on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note during the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the estimated recoverable amount of the note as of December 31, 2017, based on management's best estimate of the cash settlement amount. As of December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings under the revolving promissory note to iHeartCommunications.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive income tax legislation, referred to as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% percent to 21% effective January 1, 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax\nOther income was $29.8 million for 2017. Other expense was $70.7 million for 2016. These amounts relate primarily to net foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies.\nOur short and long term cash requirements include minimum annual guarantees for our street furniture contracts and operating leases. Noncancelable contracts and operating lease requirements are included in our direct operating expenses, which\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes does not include limitations on dividends, distributions, investments or asset sales.\nCash used for investing activities of $175.9 million during 2017 reflected our capital expenditures of $224.2 million. We spent $74.6 million in our Americas segment primarily related to the construction of new advertising structures such as digital displays, $146.4 million in our International segment primarily related to street furniture advertising and digital billboard structures, and $3.2 million by Corporate primarily related to equipment and software. This cash usage was partially offset by $72.0 million of net cash proceeds from the disposals of assets.\nInflation\n\nOther operating income, net of $354.7 million in 2016 primarily related to the net gain of $278.3 million on sale of nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the net gain of $127.6 million on sale on our business in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the $56.6 million loss, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments, on the sale of our business in Turkey in the second quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, Americas sold nine non-strategic markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $592.3 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida.\nInterest expense increased $6.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to new debt issuances.\nOn March 14, 2018, iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and certain of iHeartMedia's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, not including the Company or any of its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. The filing of the voluntary petitions triggered an event of default under the iHeartCommunications' senior credit facility and other debt agreements. The ability of iHeartCommunications' creditors to seek remedies to enforce their rights under such debt agreements is automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and the creditors' rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nIncluded in 2015 International Outdoor direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses are $8.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 to correct for accounting errors included in the results of our Netherlands subsidiary reported in prior years. Such corrections are not considered to be material to the prior year financial results.\nOther operating income, net of $354.7 million in 2016 primarily related to the net gain of $278.3 million on sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the net gain of $127.6 million on sale of our business in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the $56.6 million loss, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments, on the sale of our business in Turkey in the second quarter of 2016.\nOur International operating results were as follows:\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe were in compliance with the covenants contained in our material financing agreements as of December 31, 2017. Our ability to comply with the maintenance covenant in our senior secured credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.\niHeartCommunications' Debt Covenants\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, cash from the intercompany arrangement with iHeartComunications described below and our senior revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had $144.1 million of cash on our balance sheet, including $119.0 million of cash held outside the U.S. by our subsidiaries, a portion of which is held by non-wholly owned subsidiaries or is otherwise subject to certain restrictions and not readily accessible to us. Excess cash from our foreign operations may be transferred to our operations in the United States if needed to fund operations in the United States, subject to the foreseeable cash needs of our foreign operations and the mutual agreement of iHeartCommunications and us. If any excess cash held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund operations in the U.S., we could presently repatriate available funds without a requirement to accrue or pay U.S. taxes as a result of significant deficits, as calculated for tax law purposes, in our foreign earnings and profits, which gives us flexibility to make future cash distributions as non-taxable returns of capital. Additionally, as a result of U.S. tax reform, future dividend distributions from our international subsidiaries are exempt from U.S. federal income tax beginning January 1, 2018.\nRevenues and expenses excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements\u201d in this Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is presented because management believes that viewing certain financial results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates facilitates period to period comparisons of business performance and provides useful information to investors. Revenues and expenses excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements\u201d are calculated by converting the current period's revenues and expenses in local currency to U.S. dollars using average foreign exchange rates for the prior period.\nOur capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nBased on our annual assessment using the assumptions described above, a hypothetical 10% reduction in the estimated fair value in each of our reporting units would not result in a material impairment condition.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, Americas outdoor sold nine non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $592.3 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida. We recognized a net gain of $278.3 million related to the sale, which is included within Other operating income (expense), net.\nUnder the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires assumptions and judgments about expected volatility and forfeiture rates, among other factors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, our results of operations could be materially impacted.\nCash provided by operating activities was $147.6 million in 2017 compared to $310.3 million of cash provided in 2016. Our consolidated net loss included $840.0 million of non-cash items in 2017. Our consolidated net income in 2016 included $121.4 million of non-cash items. Non-cash items affecting our net loss include impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, provision for doubtful accounts, amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net, share-based compensation, gain on disposal of operating and fixed assets, loss on Due from iHeartCommunications, (gain) loss on investments, equity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates and other reconciling items, net as presented on the face of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to lower operating income as well as changes in working capital balances, particularly accounts receivable at our International business, which was impacted by slower collections.\nInternational direct operating expenses decreased $45.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $25.4 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses decreased $20.4 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by a $14.6 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia and lower rent expense due to lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed. These decreases were partially offset by higher site lease and production expenses in countries experiencing revenue growth. International SG&A expenses decreased $8.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses decreased $0.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $3.0 million decrease resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\nCCWH Senior Subordinated Notes\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $72.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $29.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses decreased $43.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Lower direct operating expenses was primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses.\nthan 7.0:1. The indentures contain certain other exceptions that allow us to incur additional indebtedness. The Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture also permits us to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales after making an asset sale offer if its debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) is lower than 7.0:1. The Series A CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture. There are other exceptions in these indentures that allow us to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. The exceptions in the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture that allow us to pay dividends include (i) $525.0 million of dividends made pursuant to general restricted payment baskets and (ii) dividends made using proceeds received upon a demand by us of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us. We have used substantially all of the $525.0 million general restricted payments basket capacity in the Series B CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes indenture. The Series A CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends.\nAs long as the Master Agreement continues to govern the relationship between iHeartCommunications and us, iHeartCommunications will have the option to limit our ability to incur debt or issue equity securities, among other limitations, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. Under the Master Agreement with iHeartCommunications, we are limited in our borrowings from third parties to no more than $400.0 million at any one time outstanding, without the prior written consent of iHeartCommunications.\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million during 2016 related to goodwill in one International business. During 2015, we recognized a $21.6 million impairment charge related to billboard permits in one Americas market. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nOur key assumptions using the direct valuation method are market revenue growth rates, market share, profit margin, duration and profile of the build-up period, estimated start-up capital costs and losses incurred during the build-up period, the risk-adjusted discount rate and terminal values. This data is populated using industry normalized information representing an average asset within a market.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was (234.7)% and was primarily impacted by the $32.9 million valuation allowance recorded during the period as additional deferred tax expense. The valuation allowance was recorded against a portion of the U.S. Federal and State net operating losses due to the uncertainty of the ability to utilize those losses in future periods. Additionally, the Company recorded additional taxes due to the inability to benefit from losses in certain foreign jurisdictions.\n \u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; \nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nFormat of Presentation\nThe scheduled maturities of the CCWH Senior Notes, CCWH Subordinated Notes, CCIBV Senior Notes and other debt outstanding, and our future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable lease agreements, minimum payments under other non-cancelable contracts, capital expenditure commitments and other long-term obligations as of December 31, 2017, are as follows:\nInterest Expense\nOn August 14, 2017, CCIBV, our indirect subsidiary, issued an additional $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (the New CCIBV Notes\u201d). The New CCIBV Notes were issued as additional notes under the indenture governing CCIBV's existing 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 and were issued at a premium, resulting in $156.0 million in proceeds. The New CCIBV Notes mature on December 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 8.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn accordance with the terms of the settlement for the derivative litigation filed by our stockholders regarding the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, we established a committee of our board of directors, consisting of our independent and disinterested directors, for the specific purpose of monitoring the Due from iHeartCommunications Note. This committee has the non-exclusive authority to demand payments under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note under certain specified circumstances tied to iHeartCommunications' liquidity or the amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, as long as our board of directors declares a simultaneous dividend equal to the amount so demanded. The committee last made a demand under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note on August 11, 2014. As of May 3, 2018, the committee has the right pursuant to the terms of the settlement of the derivative litigation filed by our stockholders regarding the Due from iHeartCommunications Note but not the obligation, to make a demand on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note; however, as described below, the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is currently frozen and any payment pursuant to such demand would be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nInterest Expense\nCCWH may redeem the CCWH Senior Notes, in whole or in part at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture governing the CCWH Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither CCOH nor any of its subsidiaries is permitted to make any purchase of, or otherwise effectively cancel or retire any Series A CCWH Senior Notes or Series B CCWH Senior Notes if, after giving effect thereto and, if applicable, any concurrent purchase of or other addition with respect to any Series B CCWH Senior Notes or Series A CCWH Senior Notes, as applicable, the ratio of (a) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series A CCWH Senior Notes to (b) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series B CCWH Senior Notes shall be greater than 0.25, subject to certain exceptions.\nAnnual Impairment Test\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\n\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Based on current assumptions, we have accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in these assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.\nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates of $1.7 million and $0.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, included the loss from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nWe evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debt based on historical experience for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions.\n \u2022 sell certain assets, including capital stock of its subsidiaries; \nOur advertising rates are based on a number of different factors including location, competition, type and size of display, illumination, market and gross ratings points. Gross ratings points are the total number of impressions delivered by a display or group of displays, expressed as a percentage of a market population. The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time. For all of our billboards in the United States, we use independent, third-party auditing companies to verify the number of impressions delivered by a display.\nInterest Income on Due From iHeartCommunications\nLoss on Due from iHeartCommunications\nOther operating income, net of $26.4 million in 2017 primarily related to the sale in the first quarter of 2017 of the Americas' Indianapolis market in exchange for cash and certain assets in Atlanta, Georgia, resulting in a net gain of $28.9 million, and the $6.8 million gain recognized on the sale of our ownership interest in a joint venture in Belgium during the second quarter of 2017. These gains were partially offset by the $12.1 million loss on the sale in the third quarter 2017 of our Canada business.\nSEASONALITY\nOperating Activities\nInternational Results of Operations\n \u2022 Industry revenue growth forecasts between 0.5% and 3.5% was used for the initial four-year period; \n \u2022 merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets.  In addition, the indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes provides that if CCWH (i) makes an optional redemption of the Series B CCWH Senior Notes or purchases or makes an offer to purchase the Series B CCWH Senior Notes at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an optional redemption or purchase a pro rata amount of the Series A CCWH Senior Notes or (ii) makes an asset sale offer under the indenture governing the Series B CCWH Senior Notes, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an offer to purchase a pro rata amount of Series A CCWH Senior Notes.\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million during 2017 related to goodwill in one International business. In addition, the Company recognized an impairment of $2.6 million during 2017 in relation to advertising assets that were no longer usable in one country in our International segment. During 2016, we recognized a $7.3 million impairment related to goodwill in one International business. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nLeases\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nUses of Capital\nIn the second quarter of 2016, International outdoor sold its business in Turkey. As a result, we recognized a net loss of $56.6 million, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments that were recognized upon sale of the subsidiaries in Turkey.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we sold our business in Australia for cash proceeds of $195.7 million, net of cash retained by the purchaser and closing costs. In January 2017, we sold our Indianapolis, Indiana outdoor market in exchange for certain assets in Atlanta, Georgia, plus approximately $43.1 million in cash, net of closing costs. On February 23, 2017, we paid a special cash dividend to our stockholders of $282.5 million using proceeds from the sales of certain non-strategic U.S. markets and of our business in Australia. iHeartCommunications received 89.9% or approximately $254.0 million, of the dividend, with the remaining 10.1%, or approximately $28.5 million, paid to our public stockholders. On August 14, 2017, CCIBV, our indirect subsidiary, issued $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020, as additional notes under the indenture governing CCIBV's existing 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020. Partially as a result of these transactions, our cash flows from operations have decreased due to lower revenues and higher interest expense. On October 5, 2017, we made a demand for repayment of $25.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid a special cash dividend of $25.0 million. iHeartCommunications received approximately 89.5%, or approximately $22.4 million, of the proceeds of the dividend through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the remaining approximately 10.5%, or approximately $2.6 million, of the proceeds of the dividend paid to our public stockholders. On October 31, 2017, we made a demand for repayment of $25.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid a special cash dividend of $25.0 million. iHeartCommunications received approximately 89.5%, or approximately $22.4 million, of the proceeds of the dividend through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the remaining approximately 10.5%, or approximately $2.6 million, of the proceeds of the dividend paid to our public stockholders. On January 24, 2018, we made a demand for repayment of $30.0 million outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note and simultaneously paid a special cash dividend of $30.0 million. iHeartCommunications received approximately 89.5%, or approximately $26.8 million, of the proceeds of the dividend through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the remaining approximately 10.5%, or approximately $3.2 million, of the proceeds of the dividend paid to our public stockholders. The payment of these special dividends reduces the amount of cash available to us for future working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements. Future special cash dividends will be dependent upon, among other things, our having sufficient available cash.\nPart of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as alternatives to traditional methods of displaying our clients' advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets. We believe cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these expenditures because we expect enhanced margins through: (i) lower cost of production as the advertisements will be digital and controlled by a central computer network, (ii) decreased down time on displays because the advertisements will be digitally changed rather than manually posted paper or vinyl on the face of the display, and (iii) incremental revenue through more targeted and time specific advertisements.\nThe significant expenses associated with our operations include direct production, maintenance and installation expenses as well as site lease expenses for land under our displays including revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed amounts payable under our billboard, street furniture and transit display contracts. Our direct production, maintenance and installation expenses include costs for printing, transporting and changing the advertising copy on our displays, the related labor costs, the vinyl costs, electricity costs and the costs for cleaning and maintaining our displays. Vinyl costs vary according to the complexity of the advertising copy and the quantity of displays. Our site lease expenses include lease payments for use of the land under our displays, as well as any revenue-sharing arrangements or minimum guaranteed amounts payable that we may have with the landlords. The terms of our site leases and revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed contracts generally range from one to 20 years.\nConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nOther Debt\nThis analysis does not consider the implications that such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the U.S. or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities.\nWe use various assumptions in determining the remaining useful lives of assets to be disposed of prior to the end of their useful lives and in determining the current fair market value of long-lived assets that are determined to be unrecoverable. Estimated useful lives and fair values are sensitive to factors including contractual commitments, regulatory requirements, future expected cash flows, industry growth rates and discount rates, as well as future salvage values. Our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nOn March 14, 2018, iHeartMedia, the indirect parent of the Company which owns approximately 89.5% of the Company's outstanding common stock, and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors\u201d), filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases\u201d) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). The Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries did not file voluntary petitions for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code and are not Debtors in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases.\niHeartCommunications provides the day-to-day cash management services for our cash activities and balances in the U.S. We do not have any material committed external sources of capital other than iHeartCommunications, and iHeartCommunications is not required to provide us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements. We have no access to the cash transferred from us to iHeartCommunications under the cash management arrangement. As of December 31, 2017, iHeartCommunications had $267.1 million recorded as Cash and cash equivalents\u201d on its consolidated balance sheets, of which $144.1 million was held by us and our subsidiaries. Pursuant to a final order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, as of March 14, 2018, the actual pre-iHeart bankruptcy balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note is frozen, and following March 14, 2018, intercompany allocations that would have been reflected in adjustments to the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note are instead reflected in a new intercompany balance that accrues interest at a rate equal to the interest under the Due from iHeart Communications Note. As a result, iHeartCommunications is continuing to provide the day-to-day cash management services for us during the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and we expect it to continue to do so until such arrangements are addressed through the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. We are an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications with respect to amounts owed under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note. It is still early in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and we cannot predict at this time the outcome of iHeartCommunications' efforts to restructure its indebtedness. We do not expect to recover all of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note upon the implementation of any plan of\n \u2022 create liens on its or its restricted subsidiaries' assets to secure debt; \nConsolidated Revenue\nWe manage our operating segments primarily focusing on their operating income, while Corporate expenses, Other operating income (expense), net, Interest expense, Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications, Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates, Other income, net and Income tax benefit (expense) are managed on a total company basis and are, therefore, included only in our discussion of consolidated results.\nInternational Results of Operations\n \u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and \n (3) Other long-term obligations consist of $44.8 million related to asset retirement obligations recorded pursuant to ASC 410-20, which assumes the underlying assets will be removed at some period over the next 55 years. Also included in the table is $52.2 million related to retirement plans and $151.0 million related to other long-term obligations with a specific maturity. \nThe discounted cash flow approach we use for valuing goodwill as part of the two-step impairment testing approach involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets, discounted to their present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Terminal values are also estimated and discounted to their present value.\nInternational direct operating expenses decreased $23.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $2.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses decreased $25.1 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was driven by a $70.3 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the 2016 sales of our businesses in Australia and Turkey, partially offset by higher site lease and production expenses primarily in countries experiencing revenue growth. International SG&A expenses decreased $0.6 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.7 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses decreased $2.3 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $22.6 million decrease resulting from the sale of our businesses in Australia and Turkey, partially offset by higher spending related to growth in certain countries. Included within SG&A expenses is $9.6 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to correct for accounting errors related to the misappropriation of cash identified at our China subsidiary. Such corrections are not considered to be material to the current year or prior year financial results.\nSources of Capital\nManagement typically monitors our business by reviewing the average rates, average revenue per display, occupancy, and inventory levels of each of our display types by market.\nThe CCWH Subordinated Notes are CCWH's senior subordinated obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior subordinated basis by us, CCOI and certain of our other domestic subsidiaries. The CCWH Subordinated Notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior to all of CCWH's existing and future senior debt, including the CCWH Senior Notes, equally with any of CCWH's existing and future senior subordinated debt and ahead of all of CCWH's existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the CCWH Subordinated Notes. The guarantees of the CCWH Subordinated Notes rank junior to each guarantor's existing and future senior debt, including the CCWH Senior Notes, equally with each guarantor's existing and future senior subordinated debt and ahead of each guarantor's existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the guarantees of the CCWH Subordinated Notes.\nOur operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia. However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries.\nAmericas direct operating expenses decreased $27.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $3.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses decreased $23.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in direct operating expenses was driven by a $35.4 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher site lease expenses related to new airport contracts. Americas SG&A expenses decreased $7.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $2.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG&A expenses decreased $5.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was due to a $20.4 million decrease in SG&A expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense related to higher revenues.\nOur operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia. However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries.\n(1) The senior revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $75.0 million (the revolving credit commitment). As of December 31, 2017, we had $71.2 million of letters of credit outstanding, and $3.8 million of availability, under the senior revolving credit facility.\nTax Provisions\nEquity in Loss of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive income tax legislation, referred to as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% percent to 21% effective January 1, 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new U.S. taxes on certain foreign earnings. To account for the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, generally 21% percent. To determine the impact from the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, we analyzed our cumulative foreign earnings and profits in accordance with the rules provided in the Tax Act. Based upon our preliminary analysis which is not yet complete, we have not recorded income tax expense in the current period for the one-time transition tax due to the net accumulated deficit in our foreign earnings and profits.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our billboard permits, are reviewed annually for possible impairment using the direct valuation method as prescribed in ASC 805-20-S99. Under the direct valuation method, the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was calculated at the market level as prescribed by ASC 350-30-35. Under the direct valuation method, it is assumed that rather than acquiring indefinite-lived intangible assets as a part of a going concern business, the buyer hypothetically obtains indefinite-lived intangible assets and builds a new operation with similar attributes from scratch. Thus, the buyer incurs start-up costs during the build-up phase which are normally associated with going concern value. Initial capital costs are deducted from the discounted cash flows model which results in value that is directly attributable to the indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n \u2022 Expected cash flows underlying our business plans for the periods 2017 through 2021. Our cash flow assumptions are based on detailed, multi-year forecasts performed by each of our operating segments, and reflect the advertising outlook across our businesses. \n (1) Interest payments on long-term debt consist primarily of interest on the CCWH Senior Notes, the CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes and the CCIBV Senior Notes. \nInvesting Activities\nEquity in Loss of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nOur consolidated leverage ratio, defined as total debt divided by EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) for the preceding four quarters was 8.9:1 at December 31, 2017, and senior leverage ratio, defined as senior debt divided by EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) for the preceding four quarters was 4.6:1 at December 31, 2017. As required by the definition of EBITDA in the CCWH Senior Notes indentures, our EBITDA for the preceding four quarters of $599.8 million is calculated as operating income (loss) before depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and other operating income (expense), net, plus share-based compensation, and is further adjusted for the following: (i) costs incurred in connection with severance, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, retention charges, consulting fees and other permitted activities; (ii) extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual gains or losses or expenses; (iii) non-cash charges; and (iv) various other items. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture.\nThe CCIBV Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 8.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The CCIBV Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of our International outdoor business's existing and future subsidiaries. The Company does not guarantee or otherwise assume any liability for the CCIBV Senior Notes. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of Clear Channel International B.V., and the guarantees of the notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors of the notes.\nCash used for financing activities of $726.5 million during 2016 primarily reflected two cash dividends paid in the aggregate amount of $755.5 million, partially offset by net transfers of $45.1 million in cash from iHeartCommunications, which represents the activity in the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d account.\nThe following table reflects a reconciliation of EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) to operating income and net cash provided by operating activities for the four quarters ended December 31, 2017:\nAmericas direct operating expenses increased $3.8 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses increased $1.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in direct operating expenses was driven primarily by higher site lease expenses related to new and existing airport contracts and print displays, partially offset by the $13.2 million decrease in expense due to the impact of the sales of non-strategic outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and our Canadian business in the third quarter of 2017. Americas SG&A expenses decreased $5.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the $1.0 million impact from\n \u2022 On August 14, 2017, Clear Channel International B.V. (\"CCIBV\"), our indirect subsidiary, issued $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (the \"New CCIBV Notes\") , as additional notes under the indenture governing CCIBV's existing 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020. \nGain (loss) on Investments, net\nAs of December 31, 2017, CCWH senior notes represented $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, which consisted of $735.8 million aggregate principal amount of Series A Senior Notes due 2022 (the Series A CCWH Senior Notes\u201d) and $1,989.2 million aggregate principal amount of Series B CCWH Senior Notes due 2022 (the Series B CCWH Senior Notes\u201d). The CCWH Senior Notes are guaranteed by us, Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. ( CCOI\u201d) and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nIn the fourth quarter 2016, International outdoor sold its business in Australia for cash proceeds of $195.7 million. As a result, we recognized a net gain of $127.6 million, which is net of $14.6 million in cumulative translation adjustments that were recognized upon the sale of our business in Australia.\nLoss on Due from iHeartCommunications included the $855.6 million impairment of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, which was recorded as a result of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filed by iHeartCommunications.\nOur Americas operating results were as follows:\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $18.9 million. Excluding the $0.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $18.1 million primarily due to the sale of the nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nExpected lease term Our expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the lease term exceeds 75% of the leased asset's useful life. The expected lease term is also used in determining the depreciable life of the asset. An increase in the expected lease term will increase the probability that a lease may be considered a capital lease and will generally result in higher interest and depreciation expense for a leased property recorded on our balance sheet.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $13.3 million. Excluding the $5.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $7.8 million primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nCorporate expenses increased $0.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $4.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses increased $5.0 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily resulting from higher litigation costs and higher expenses related to non-cash compensation plans.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $16.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $9.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $6.4 million during 2016 compared to 2015. SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, and were partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\n \u2022 merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; \nAmericas revenue decreased $70.6 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.7 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue decreased $62.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue is due to the $102.7 million impact of the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue resulting from these sales was partially offset by increased revenues from digital billboards from new deployments and higher occupancy on existing digital billboards, as well as new airport contracts, and higher revenues in Latin America.\n \u2022 During the third quarter of 2017, Americas sold its ownership interest in a joint venture in Canada. As a result, the Company recognized a net loss on sale of $12.1 million. \nShare-based compensation expenses are recorded in corporate expenses and were $9.6 million, $10.3 million and $8.5 million

position. CCOH operates advertising displays in the Americas and internationally. \n\n- In March 2018, CCOH's parent company iHeartMedia filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This has impacted CCOH's liquidity and its ability to recover amounts owed by iHeartMedia.\n\nFinancial Results\n- In 2017, CCOH had a consolidated net loss of $627.5 million compared to net income of $164.4 million in 2016. The loss was primarily due to a $855.6 million impairment charge on the amount owed by iHeartMedia.\n\n- Revenue decreased 3.6% in 2017, largely due to divestments of international businesses. Operating income declined 63.5%.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Historically CCOH has relied on iHeartMedia for liquidity and cash management services. Its access to cash is now limited given the bankruptcy filing.\n\n- As of December 31, 2017, CCOH had $144.1 million of cash on hand and $212 million receivable from iHeartMedia. It has $5.3 billion of debt outstanding.\n\n- CCOH paid $332.8 million in dividends in 2017 using proceeds from debt issuances and asset sales. Its ability to pay future dividends is now restricted.\n\n- CCOH expects cash flow from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures over the next 12 months. Its liquidity outlook is uncertain given the iHeartMedia bankruptcy.\n\nKey Contractual Obligations\n- CCOH has $10.1 billion of total contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter related to debt, operating leases, capital commitments and other obligations."}
