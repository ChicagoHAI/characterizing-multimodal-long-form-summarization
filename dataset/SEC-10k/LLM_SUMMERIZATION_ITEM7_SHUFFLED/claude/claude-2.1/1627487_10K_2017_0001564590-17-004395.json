Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d section of this annual report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this annual report and included elsewhere in this annual report. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section and included elsewhere in this annual report.\nIn this section and other parts of this Form 10-K, we refer to certain measures used for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We also may refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), but have corresponding GAAP-based measures. Where non-GAAP measures appear, we provide tables reconciling these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP-based measures and make reference to a discussion of their use. We believe these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday that is closest to December 31 of that year. Each fiscal year generally comprises four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. References to Fiscal 2016 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended January 1, 2017. References to Fiscal 2015 relate to our 53-week fiscal year ended January 3, 2016. References to Fiscal 2014 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended December 28, 2014.\nOverview\nFogo de Ch\u00e3o (fogo-dee-shoun) is a leading Brazilian steakhouse, or churrascaria, which has specialized for more than 37 years in fire-roasting high-quality meats utilizing the centuries-old Southern Brazilian cooking technique of churrasco. We deliver a distinctive and authentic Brazilian dining experience through the combination of our high-quality Brazilian cuisine and our differentiated service model known as espeto corrido (Portuguese for continuous service\u201d) delivered by our churrasqueiros, which we refer to as our gaucho chefs. We offer our guests a variety of menu choices including our most popular offering the Full Churrasco Experience as well Gaucho Lunch, Weekend Brazilian Brunch and Bar Fogo menu items. The Full Churrasco Experience, our prix fixe menu, provides the opportunity to experience a variety of meats including beef, lamb, pork and chicken, simply seasoned and carefully fire-roasted to expose their natural flavors as well as a selection of fresh seasonal salads and specialty items at the Market Table.\nGrowth Strategies and Outlook\nOur growth is based on the following strategies:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Grow our restaurant base;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Grow our comparable restaurant sales; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Improve margins by leveraging our infrastructure and investments in human capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe we are in the early stages of our growth with 47 current restaurants, 35 in the US, including our newest domestic restaurant that we opened in Uptown Dallas, TX in February 2017, 10 in Brazil and two joint venture restaurants in Mexico. Based on internal analysis and a study prepared by an independent third party, we believe there is a long-term growth potential for more than 100 domestic sites, with additional new restaurants internationally. We have a long track record of successful new restaurant development, having grown our restaurant count by a multiple of 10 since 2000, and at a 12.7% CAGR since 2010. While new restaurants are expected to be a key driver of our growth, we believe positive comparable restaurant sales growth and margin expansion through leveraging our infrastructure will also contribute to strong future growth.\nRestaurant Development\nRestaurant openings reflect the number of new restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. We opened four restaurants during Fiscal 2016, including our second joint venture restaurant in Mexico City, which opened in October 2016. Over the next five years, we plan to increase our company-owned restaurant count by at least 10% annually, with North America being our primary market for new restaurant development. In addition, over the next five years, we plan to opportunistically open new\nrestaurants in Brazil as attractive real estate locations become available. We will pursue growth in international markets through a combination of company-owned restaurants and joint ventures, which we believe allows us to expand our brand with limited capital investment by us. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant Activity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning of Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Openings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Closings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurants at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Events\n2016 Summer Olympics\nRio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics which were held during the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. As a result, we estimate our two Rio de Janeiro restaurants contributed approximately $1.4 million of incremental revenue, as compared to Fiscal 2015.\nCommodity Pricing\nWe experienced lower and stable beef prices in Fiscal 2016, which allowed us to improve food costs as compared to Fiscal 2015. However, in Fiscal 2016 the food-at-home (grocery store or supermarket food items) CPI in the US decreased 1.3% as compared to Fiscal 2015 which marked the first annual decline since 1967.\nExchange Rate Impact\nWe experienced significant foreign currency impact during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 due to fluctuations of the Brazilian Real relative to the US dollar. When the US dollar strengthens compared to the Brazilian Real, it has a negative impact on our Brazilian operating results upon translation of those results into US dollars for the purposes of consolidation. We anticipate continued foreign currency volatility throughout Fiscal 2017 with respect to the Brazilian Real. See Supplemental Selected Constant Currency Information\u201d on page 56 for the exchange rate impact on current financial periods.\nRecent Events in Brazil\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2015 a series of protests began in Brazil against the Brazilian government and its President. The initial protests occurred in cities throughout Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paolo, and continued throughout the remainder of Fiscal 2015. In March 2016 there were additional anti-government and anti-corruption protests throughout Brazil. During the latter half of Fiscal 2016, the former President of Brazil was impeached and protests occurred in a number of cities in response to government austerity plans. As a result of the protests and political unrest, our restaurants in Brazil experienced reduced guest traffic in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. It is possible that further protests or other social unrest, political activity or political instability may occur in Brazil, which could impact our guest traffic, thereby affecting our revenue and net income. In addition to the uncertain political environment and events discussed above, Brazil continues to suffer from a protracted economic recession that negatively impacts our guests.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Operating Results\n52 vs. 53 Week Fiscal Year\nFiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2014 contained 52 weeks whereas Fiscal 2015 contained 53 weeks. We estimate the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 contributed approximately $6.8 million of incremental revenue, as compared to Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2014. While certain expenses that were directly related to the incremental revenue increased, other expenses, such as fixed costs, were incurred on a calendar basis.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn June 24, 2015, we completed our initial public offering (\"IPO\") of 5,073,528 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, which included 661,764 shares of common stock sold to the underwriters pursuant to their option to purchase additional shares. After underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering costs, we received net proceeds from the IPO of $91.3 million. Proceeds from the IPO, together with borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our 2012 Credit Facility.\nCertain share-based awards granted from 2012 through 2015 include vesting conditions that require both (i) completion of a four or five-year vesting period and (ii) satisfaction of a Liquidity Event, as defined in the applicable award agreement. Under the terms of those agreements, a Liquidity Event is defined as the earlier to occur of (i) a change in control transaction or (ii) an initial public offering. Upon the closing of the IPO, options for the purchase of 783,606 shares of common stock vested as a result of the satisfaction of the Liquidity Event vesting condition. The Company recognized $5.7 million of compensation expense associated with these options during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nTermination of the Advisory Services Agreement\nAs a result of the IPO, we terminated our Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and paid a one-time non-recurring payment of $7.5 million in connection with the termination during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. While we have benefitted from savings on management fees that we incurred as a private company, these benefits have been offset by the incremental costs we incurred as a public company such as legal, accounting, insurance and other compliance costs.\n2015 Credit Facility\nConcurrently with the consummation of our IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into a new $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility\u201d). Loans under the 2015 Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% or at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50% and will mature in 2020. The 2015 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including financial maintenance covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the underlying credit facility agreement). Starting in Fiscal 2017 and through Fiscal 2018, the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio may not be greater than 5.25 to 1 and the ratio will further reduce to 5.0 to 1 in Fiscal 2019, through maturity. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio may not be less than 2.00 to 1. Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility may vary significantly from time to time depending on our cash needs at any given time. Upon the consummation of our IPO we drew $165.0 million under the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from our IPO, to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility. We recorded a loss of $6.0 million on the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nStock Split\nIn connection with the closing of the IPO, we effected a stock split pursuant to which each share held by the holder of common stock was reclassified into 25.4588 shares. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated to give effect to the stock split.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of the IPO, and the subsequent use of proceeds to pay down debt, we reviewed our position on indefinite reinvestment of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries' undistributed earnings pursuant to ASC 740-30-25 (formerly APB 23). Considering the significant reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis, along with our plan for future international growth, we determined that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would now be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. As a result of the change in assertion, we reduced our deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings by $13.9 million as a discrete item in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 and no longer provide for US income and additional foreign taxes related to undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries. If there is a change in assertion regarding indefinite reinvestment of undistributed earnings we would record a tax liability attributable to those undistributed earnings.\nAdditionally, as a result of the IPO and reduced debt service costs, the Company reviewed its valuation allowance and determined that it was more likely than not that it would be able to realize its net deferred tax assets without regard to deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite lived intangibles. The Company analyzed sources of positive and negative evidence in determining whether it would release its valuation allowance. Ultimately, historic cumulative earnings, coupled with the Company's change in capital structure resulting from the IPO, led the Company to recognize its net deferred tax asset.\nPerformance Indicators\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing are the number of new restaurant openings, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nNew Restaurant Openings\nOur ability to successfully open new restaurants and expand our restaurant base is critical to adding revenue capacity to meet our goals for growth. New restaurant openings contribute additional operating weeks and revenue to our business. Before a new restaurant opens, we incur pre-opening costs, as described below. New restaurants often open with an initial start-up period of sales volatility. Operating margins tend to stabilize within twelve months of opening. New restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher food, labor and other direct operating expenses and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. To achieve our goal to successfully open new restaurants, we consider a number of factors including macro and micro economic conditions, availability of appropriate locations, competition in local markets, and the availability of teams to manage new locations. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nComparable Restaurant Sales\nWe consider a restaurant to be comparable during the first full fiscal quarter following the eighteenth full month of operations. We adjust the sales included in the comparable restaurant calculation for restaurant closures, primarily as a result of remodels, so that the periods will be comparable. Changes in comparable restaurant sales reflect changes in sales for the comparable group of restaurants over a specified period of time. Changes in comparable sales reflect changes in guest count trends as well as changes in average check per person, as described below. For Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, there were 35, 29 and 27 restaurants, respectively, in our calculations of comparable restaurant sales. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants, as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded.\nAverage Check Per Person\nAverage check per person is calculated by dividing total comparable restaurant sales by comparable restaurant guest counts for a given time period. Average check per person is influenced by menu prices and menu mix. Management uses this indicator to analyze trends in guests' preferences, the effectiveness of menu offerings and per guest expenditures.\nAverage Unit Volumes\nWe measure average unit volumes ( AUVs\u201d) on an annual (52-week) basis. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, we exclude the 53rd week from the AUV calculation for consistency purposes. AUVs consist of the average sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. We adjust the sales included in AUV calculations for restaurant closures. This measurement allows us to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base.\nGuest Counts\nGuest counts are measured by the number of entr\u00e9es ordered at our restaurants over a given time period. Examples of our entr\u00e9es include our Full Churrasco Experience, \u00e0 la carte seafood items, and Gaucho Lunch.\nRestaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin\nRestaurant contribution is defined as revenue less restaurant operating costs (which include food and beverage costs, compensation and benefits costs, and occupancy and certain other operating costs but exclude depreciation and amortization expense). Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of revenue. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. A reconciliation of restaurant contribution to revenue for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 is provided on page 51 and for Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 on page 54.\nWe believe that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties because they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. We use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, to evaluate our restaurant performance across periods and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared with our competitors.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization plus the sum of certain operating and non-operating expenses, including pre-opening costs, losses on modifications and extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation costs, management and consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges, one-time costs associated with the 2015 IPO, retention agreement costs, and other non-cash or similar adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. By monitoring and controlling our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we can gauge the overall profitability of our company. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because (i) we believe this measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors will find this measure useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin internally as a benchmark to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) it does not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) it does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) it does not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income is provided on page 55.\nSignificant Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consists of food and beverage sales, net of any employee meals and complimentary meals. Revenue is recognized when food and beverage products are sold at our restaurants net of any discounts. Revenue in a given period is directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of restaurants we operate and comparable restaurant sales growth. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards that do not have expiration dates are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of the sale and recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed by the holder. The portion of gift cards sold which are never redeemed is commonly referred to as gift card breakage. We recognize gift card breakage revenue for gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and we determine there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to governmental agencies.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and distribution of our menu items. We measure food and beverage costs by tracking the cost as a percentage of revenue. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue are generally influenced by the cost of food and beverage items, distribution costs and sales mix. These components are variable in nature, increase with revenue, are subject to increases or decreases based on fluctuations in commodity costs, including beef, lamb, pork, chicken and seafood prices, and depend in part on the controls we have in place to manage costs at our restaurants.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefits costs comprise restaurant and regional management salaries and bonuses, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-related expenses, including bonus expenses, share-based compensation, vacation pay, payroll taxes, fringe benefits and health insurance expenses and are measured by tracking hourly and total labor as a percentage of revenue.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses comprise all occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, utility costs, credit card fees, real estate property and other related taxes and other related restaurant supply and occupancy costs, but exclude depreciation and amortization expense, and are measured by tracking occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs include all media, production and related costs for both local restaurant advertising and national marketing. We measure the efficiency of our marketing and advertising expenditures by tracking these costs as a percentage of total revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs are comprised of costs related to certain corporate and administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations. These expenses are generally fixed and reflect management, supervisory and staff salaries, employee benefits and bonuses, share-based compensation, travel expense, information systems, training, corporate rent, technology, market research, and professional and consulting fees, including fees related to the implementation of, and compliance with, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We measure general and administrative costs by tracking general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs are costs incurred prior to, and directly associated with, opening a restaurant, and primarily consist of manager salaries, relocation costs, recruiting expenses, employee payroll and related training costs for new employees, including rehearsal of service activities, as well as straight-line lease costs incurred prior to opening. In addition, pre-opening costs include public relations costs incurred prior to opening. We typically start incurring pre-opening costs four to six months prior to opening and these costs tend to increase four weeks prior to opening as we begin training activities.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and certain definite life intangible assets. We depreciate capitalized leasehold improvements over the shorter of the total expected lease term or their estimated useful life.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we operate. Historically we have generated taxable income in the US and Brazil. Our provision includes federal, state and local, and foreign current and deferred income tax expense.\nSegment Reporting\nWe operate our restaurants using a single restaurant concept and brand. Each restaurant under our single global brand operates with similar types of products and menu, providing a continuous service style, similar contracts, customers and employees, irrespective of location. We have identified two operating segments: US and Brazil, which is how we organize our restaurants for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Our joint venture in Mexico is included in the US for segment reporting purposes as the operations of the joint venture are monitored by the US segment management.\nResults of Operations\nThe

increased due to a $27.6 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 and a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.8 million, a $4.2 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nUS restaurant revenue increased due to a $26.5 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.0 million and a $2.3 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue. US comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased due to a $1.9 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million and the 53rd week impact of $0.8 million, offset by a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics and a $1.1 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. Brazil comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.5%.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs increased due to a $7.5 million increase in food and beverage costs from non-comparable restaurants. However, the increase was offset by a $3.1 million decrease in comparable restaurant food and beverage costs, a $1.8 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased primarily due to reductions in protein commodity pricing, improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings and waste reduction efforts.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefit costs increased due to a $9.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expenses and a $0.2 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expenses, offset by a $1.7 million decrease in cumulative share-based compensation expense primarily recognized in conjunction with the IPO in Fiscal 2015, a $1.4 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings as our management teams become more accustomed to predicting, managing and servicing the sales volumes of their new restaurants. The increase is also being driven by investments in third managers as well as increases in minimum wages and group health insurance claims.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant expenses and a $2.0 million increase in comparable restaurant expenses, offset by a $0.6 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.3 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased as a result of increased fixed occupancy costs on lower revenue.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs increased due to a larger revenue base and additional advertising expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total marketing and advertising expenses were essentially flat.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs decreased due to the 2015 recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter triggered by the IPO in the amount of $4.3 million, as well as a one-time charge of $7.5 million for the disposition of the Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of THL in connection with the IPO and a $1.2 million decrease in corporate compensation expense. These decreases were offset by a $0.3 million increase in insurance, a $0.3 million increase in corporate travel and a $0.2 million increase in tax consulting expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total general and administrative costs decreased as a result of lapping IPO related expenses from Fiscal 2015.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs decreased due to the timing of new restaurant development. During Fiscal 2016 we opened four restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that are due to open in Fiscal 2017. During Fiscal 2015 we opened seven restaurants and had an additional restaurant under construction at year-end that opened during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 we paid-off our 2012 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the IPO plus proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. As a result, we wrote off unamortized loan costs and unamortized original issue discounts, and paid a pre-payment penalty of $0.3 million for a total loss on the extinguishment of $6.0 million.\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\nDuring Fiscal 2016, we recognized a $0.3 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased due to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance owed and a reduction in interest rates following the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility that occurred during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased due to increased cash and cash equivalents in Brazil and favorable interest rates earned on those balances.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe recognized income tax expense in Fiscal 2016 as compared to an income tax benefit in Fiscal 2015. The increase in income tax expense from Fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to the change in assertion with respect to undistributed foreign earnings and the release of a valuation allowance during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. We had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, we asserted that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis as a result of the IPO. Additionally, future US cash projections and our intent to continue investing in restaurants in foreign jurisdictions with cash generated in those jurisdictions, drove our decision to make the assertion. We also made the decision to release our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset. The decision to release the valuation allowance was triggered in conjunction with the IPO. Reduced debt service costs and historic cumulative earnings (US pretax income plus permanent tax differences) were all sources of positive evidence that led us to believe that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets.\nOur consolidated effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to foreign earnings being subjected to taxation at lower tax rates, FICA tax credits, state income taxes, and nondeductible equity-based compensation.\nRestaurant Contribution\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

million and a $1.0 million increase in comparable restaurant revenue, offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of $18.1 million and a $0.7 million decrease in other revenue. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 7.2% due to the 2014 World Cup benefit.\nUS restaurant revenue increased due to a $17.4 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, the 53rd week impact of $6.0 million and a $4.6 million increase in comparable restaurant revenue. US comparable restaurant sales increased 2.7%, primarily driven by an increase in guest traffic as a result of opening for lunch on Sunday nationwide beginning in May 2015.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased primarily due to a negative foreign exchange impact of $18.1 million and a $3.6 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue, offset by a $3.1 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 and the 53rd week impact of $0.8 million. On a constant currency and World Cup adjusted basis Brazil comparable restaurant sales increased 9.0%.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment during Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs increased primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in food and beverage costs from non-comparable restaurants and a 53rd week impact of $1.8 million, offset by a positive foreign exchange impact of $6.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased, primarily due to initiatives to reduce waste and introduce lower cost seasonal menu offerings.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefit costs increased primarily due to a $4.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expenses, plus a $1.4 million increase in share-based compensation expense, primarily due to the recognition of share-based awards that were granted in 2012 through 2015 which had liquidity vesting conditions that were satisfied by the IPO, triggering the recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. Benefits cost including workers' compensation and healthcare claims costs increased by $1.9 million in Fiscal 2015. These increases were offset by a foreign exchange impact of $2.4 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased, primarily as a result of share-based compensation triggered by the IPO and reduced leverage on lower revenue in Brazil due to the 2014 World Cup benefit.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased due to a $4.0 million increase in non-comparable restaurant expense, the 53rd week impact of $0.6 million and a $0.5 million increase in comparable restaurant expense, offset by a positive foreign exchange impact of $3.0 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased, primarily due to increased occupancy costs for rent, CAM, taxes and insurance in the US and reduced leverage on lower revenue in Brazil due to the 2014 World Cup benefit.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs increased primarily due to a planned increase in advertising spend on digital marketing. As a percentage of total revenue, marketing and advertising costs increased from 2.1% to 2.4%.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs increased primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in share-based compensation primarily due to share-based awards that were granted in 2012 through 2015 which had liquidity vesting conditions that were satisfied by the IPO triggering the recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 and a $7.5 million charge for the termination of the Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of THL in connection with the IPO. These increases were offset by positive foreign exchange impact of $0.9 million. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative costs increased from 8.2% to 12.0%.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs increased $2.9 million to $4.9 million for Fiscal 2015. We opened seven restaurants during Fiscal 2015 and had an additional restaurant under construction during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 that opened in January 2016, compared to three openings during Fiscal 2014.\nLoss on Extinguishment / Modification of Debt\nOn June 24, 2015 we paid-off our 2012 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the IPO plus proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. As a result, we wrote off unamortized loan costs and unamortized original issue discounts, and paid a pre-payment penalty of $0.3 million for a total loss on the extinguishment of $6.0 million. We had previously refinanced the 2012 Credit Facility in April 2014 to obtain a reduced interest rate and recorded a $3.1 million loss on the modification.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased due to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance owed and a reduction in interest rates due to using the proceeds of the IPO to pay down the 2012 Credit Facility. The IPO and subsequent payoff of the 2012 Credit Facility was completed on June 24, 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, interest expense, net of capitalized interest decreased from 6.8% to 3.7%.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nDuring Fiscal 2015 we recorded an income tax benefit of $14.2 million primarily due to the reversal of $13.9 million in deferred tax liabilities. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2015, we determined that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would now be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. As a result of our change in assertion, we reduced our deferred tax liabilities attributable to those unremitted earnings and no longer provide for US income and additional foreign taxes related to the undistributed earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries. Additionally, the Company determined that it would realize its net deferred tax asset and as such, released its valuation allowance of $2.8 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nRestaurant

Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency by retranslating results across all prior periods presented using a derived exchange rate for the most current year periods presented based on actual results. The tables set forth below calculate constant currency at a foreign currency exchange rate of 3.4411 Brazilian reais to 1 US dollar, which represents the derived exchange rates for Fiscal 2016, calculated as explained above. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 262,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,442\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,567\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 270,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 242,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,446\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (191\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,040\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant contribution at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant contribution margin at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital requirements are principally the build-out cost of new restaurants, renovations of existing restaurants and corporate infrastructure, as well payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and lease obligations. We also require capital resources to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate support and information technology infrastructures. Our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, construction cost contributions from landlords when available to us (also known as tenant improvement allowances) and borrowings under our existing and previous credit facilities.\nIn Fiscal 2016, we effectuated an internal restructuring whereby we created a new Dutch holding company, FDC Netherlands Cooperatief U.A. ( Fogo COOP\u201d) and contributed all of the Brazilian subsidiaries down below Fogo COOP. We then made contemporaneous check-the-box elections to treat these subsidiaries as disregarded entities or branches of Fogo COOP. For US federal income tax purposes, this transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D) or (F). Following, the internal restructuring, Fogo COOP is treated as the regarded or separate legal entity for US federal income tax purposes and the Brazilian entities are branches or divisions of Fogo COOP. Consequently, income or losses earned by the Brazilian entities are deemed to be earned by Fogo COOP for US federal income tax purposes. We consider the undistributed earnings related to Fogo COOP (and indirectly the earnings of its Brazilian disregarded entities as well as the earnings related to its majority interest in its Mexican joint ventures) to be indefinitely reinvested and expect them to continue to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, no provision for US income and additional foreign taxes has been recorded on aggregate undistributed earnings of $44.0 million as of January 1, 2017. If there is a change in assertion regarding indefinite or permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of our Dutch subsidiary, we would record a deferred tax liability attributable to those undistributed earnings in the amount of approximately $15.4 million. As of January 1, 2017, we had $31.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $21.7 million was held indirectly in Brazil by Fogo COOP's Brazilian disregarded entities, and $1.1 million was held directly in the Netherlands by Fogo COOP, which could be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the US.\nWe intend to spend approximately $26.0 million to $30.0 million in Fiscal 2017 on capital expenditures, including approximately $20.0 million to $22.0 million for new restaurant development and approximately $6.0 million to $8.0 million on opportunistic restaurant remodeling.\nWe believe that our cash from operations and borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our restaurants or systems such as our planned opportunistic restaurant remodel program, which we could fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations.\nThe following table presents the primary components of net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated.\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38,353\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35,423\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,503\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,011\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,965\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,240\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,263\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2016 increased $18.7 million from Fiscal 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to an $8.6 million decrease in cash paid interest, an $8.2 million increase in cash related to the timing of collections of receivables and payments of liabilities, a $1.3 million decrease in pre-opening expenses, and a $0.7 million net increase in deferred revenue.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2015 decreased $4.7 million from Fiscal 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a $7.5 million fee paid to an affiliate of THL as a result of the termination of the advisory services agreement with that affiliate and a $2.9 million increase in pre-opening expenses, all offset by a $4.1 million decrease in cash paid for interest, a $0.6 million decrease in cash paid for income taxes net of refunds, a $0.6 million net increase in deferred revenue and a $0.4 million decrease in inventories.\nInvesting Activities\nFor Fiscal 2016, compared to Fiscal 2015, net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $2.9 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\nFor Fiscal 2015, compared to Fiscal 2014, net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $9.9 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows used by financing activities increased $19.8 million from Fiscal 2015. In Fiscal 2015, the Company generated $259.4 million from the IPO and borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility, offset by the payoff of the 2012 Credit Facility, pre-payment penalty, debt issuance costs and payment of IPO costs. In Fiscal 2016, the Company made $15.0 million repayments under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities increased $17.8 million from Fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily due to net proceeds from the sale of common stock during the IPO as well as proceeds from the draw on the 2015 Credit Facility, all offset by principal payments to extinguish the 2012 Credit Facility.\n2015 Credit Facility\nOn June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into the 2015 Credit Facility. Upon the closing of the IPO, we drew $165.0 million on the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from the IPO, to repay the outstanding debt under the 2012 Credit Facility.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility provides for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on June 24, 2020.\nAt our option, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans and bear interest at a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, respectively, plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate\u201d for any Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be between 50 and 150 basis points with respect to Base Rate Loans and between 150 and 250 basis points with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, depending on the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio. The current Applicable Rate will be (i) in the case of any Base Rate Loan 1.0% and in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, 2.0%.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and authorize or pay dividends. In addition, we will be required to maintain two financial covenants, which include a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio (at levels that vary until maturity) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. At January 1, 2017, these required ratios were 5.50 to 1 and 2.00 to 1, respectively and the Company was in compliance with those covenants.\nAs of January 1, 2017, we had seven letters of credit outstanding for a total of $4.9 million and $95.1 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations\nLeases\nWe lease certain restaurant locations, storage spaces, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our restaurant leases generally have initial terms of between 10 and 20 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments. Our leases expire at various dates between 2017 and 2033, excluding extensions at our option. Some of our restaurant leases include renewal options, rent abatements and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Some of our leases also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at January 1, 2017 on actual basis and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 1 -\n3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 3 -\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workers compensation reserve(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Scheduled interest payments(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease (minimum rent)(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 206,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 375,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 194,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Estimated future payments attributable to our workers compensation reserve.

Future minimum lease payments attributable to one location in Mexico contain annual escalations that are tied to the US CPI-U index. These payments, which will be made in the functional currency of the country, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate and the US CPI-U index rate existing at the time of the lease was executed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and lease obligations. As of January 1, 2017, letters of credit and letters of guaranty totaling $4.9 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as the valuation of long-lived, definite and indefinite-lived assets, estimated useful lives of assets, the reasonably assured lease terms of operating leases, valuation of the workers' compensation and Company-sponsored employee health insurance program liabilities, and deferred tax valuation allowances, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nInsurance Reserves\nBeginning in Fiscal 2013, the Company self-insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation claims and Company-sponsored employee health insurance programs. We estimate the accrued liabilities for all self-insurance programs at the end of each reporting period. Our estimate is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and actuarial assumptions. Beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, we engaged a third party actuary to assist us in estimating our liability for our workers' compensation claims. We elected to accrue the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims discounted based on the cash flow estimates provided by the actuary. Prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 we did not discount the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims. The discount on the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims as of January 1, 2017 is approximately $0.2 million. We believe that applying a discount to the estimated future cash flows provided by the actuarial analysis results in a more accurate estimate of the liability. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs is not discounted. The estimated liability for workers' compensation claims was $1.7 million as of January 1, 2017. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs was $0.3 million as of January 1, 2017.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If impairment exists, the amount of impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value, as determined by each location's projected future discounted cash flows. This assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives, which are subject to a significant degree of judgment. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. During Fiscal 2016, the Company recognized a $0.3 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil. We did not record any impairment related to long-lived assets in any of the other periods presented.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized. We test our goodwill annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. We have identified two reporting units, the US and Brazil, based on the geography of the Company's operations to which goodwill is attributable. The impairment evaluation is conducted annually using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess or carrying value over fair value. No impairment to goodwill was recorded during any of the periods presented.\nIntangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. We test our indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment, through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. The estimated fair value is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to the assigned value of the Fogo de Ch\u00e3o trade name. Definite-lived intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements. The non-compete agreements are amortized over five years, which is the term of the agreements, and are measured for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in the same manner as long-lived assets. No impairments related to these intangible assets were recorded in any of the periods presented.\nOperating Leases and Deferred Rent\nWe operate the majority of our restaurants in leased premises. We record the minimum base rents including option periods which in the judgement of management are reasonably assured of renewal. In determining whether an option period is reasonably assured for renewal we consider the capital outlay required for a location and our target return on that investment. For purposes of calculating straight-line rents, the lease term commences on the date we obtain control of the property, which is normally when the property is ready for normal tenant improvements (build-out period). The difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as a deferred rent liability. Allowances for tenant improvements are included in the deferred rent liability and recognized over the life of the lease by reducing rent expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under ASC Topic 740, income taxes are accounted for based upon the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We estimate our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year-end. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of changes in accounting policies and we incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income. The assumptions we use are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.\nWe had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, the Company asserted that undistributed net earnings of its Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis as a result of the IPO. Additionally, future US cash projections and the Company's intent to continue investing in restaurants in foreign jurisdictions with cash generated in those jurisdictions drove the decision to make the assertion. Because we consider the undistributed earnings related to our Brazilian subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and are expected to continue to be indefinitely reinvested, no provision for US income and additional foreign taxes is recorded on the aggregate undistributed earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries.\nWe recognize tax liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, and adjust those liabilities when judgments change as a result of evaluation of new information not previously available. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of our tax liabilities. These differences are reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740).\u201d This update requires that entities with a classified balance sheet present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. This update can be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as of July 3, 2016 on a retrospective basis resulting in a reclassification of $2.9 million of current deferred tax assets against non-current deferred tax liabilities of $16.0 million as of January 3, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements, requiring an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs attributable to line-of-credit arrangements after the adoption of ASU 2015-03. In particular, ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of such arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of April 3, 2016. The Company's financial statement presentation was consistent with the guidance in ASU 2015-15. As a result, there was no impact to the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon adoption. Unamortized debt issuance costs as of January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, which are attributable to the Company's 2015 Credit Facility (revolving line-of-credit), are included in other assets (noncurrent) in the consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d ASU 2016-09 requires among other things that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the new guidance provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. The Company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur as provided under ASU 2016-09. The adoption of this guidance did not a have material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 820): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\u201d ASU 2015-02 provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation model. The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this new standard during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued and requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, ending after December 15, 2016. Accordingly, the Company has adopted this ASU and evaluated the Company's ability to continue as a going concern as well as the need for related footnote disclosure. The Company has concluded no disclosure is necessary regarding the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently issued accounting standards not included below are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d The core principle of the standard is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. New qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements aim to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,\" which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one-year for all entities. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),\" in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,\" and in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,\" all of which provide additional clarification on certain topics addressed in ASU 2014-09. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. The Company has not yet selected a transition method or determined the effect, if any, that this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\u201d The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this, the amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The measurement of expected credit losses will be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The amendments in this ASU will be applied using a modified-retrospective approach and, for public entities, are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\u201d which clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current GAAP. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).\u201d ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth from time to time, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out of any extended transition period, and as a result we will seek to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering which will be June 2020, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.", "item_7_truncated": "Concurrently with the consummation of our IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into a new $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility\u201d). Loans under the 2015 Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% or at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50% and will mature in 2020. The 2015 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including financial maintenance covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the underlying credit facility agreement). Starting in Fiscal 2017 and through Fiscal 2018, the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio may not be greater than 5.25 to 1 and the ratio will further reduce to 5.0 to 1 in Fiscal 2019, through maturity. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio may not be less than 2.00 to 1. Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility may vary significantly from time to time depending on our cash needs at any given time. Upon the consummation of our IPO we drew $165.0 million under the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from our IPO, to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility. We recorded a loss of $6.0 million on the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 262,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,442\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,567\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 270,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 242,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,446\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (191\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,040\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant contribution at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant contribution margin at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as the valuation of long-lived, definite and indefinite-lived assets, estimated useful lives of assets, the reasonably assured lease terms of operating leases, valuation of the workers' compensation and Company-sponsored employee health insurance program liabilities, and deferred tax valuation allowances, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2015 decreased $4.7 million from Fiscal 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a $7.5 million fee paid to an affiliate of THL as a result of the termination of the advisory services agreement with that affiliate and a $2.9 million increase in pre-opening expenses, all offset by a $4.1 million decrease in cash paid for interest, a $0.6 million decrease in cash paid for income taxes net of refunds, a $0.6 million net increase in deferred revenue and a $0.4 million decrease in inventories.\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38,353\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35,423\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,503\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,011\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,965\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,240\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,263\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nFood and beverage costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and distribution of our menu items. We measure food and beverage costs by tracking the cost as a percentage of revenue. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue are generally influenced by the cost of food and beverage items, distribution costs and sales mix. These components are variable in nature, increase with revenue, are subject to increases or decreases based on fluctuations in commodity costs, including beef, lamb, pork, chicken and seafood prices, and depend in part on the controls we have in place to manage costs at our restaurants.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Fogo de Ch\u00e3o, Inc.

Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued and requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, ending after December 15, 2016. Accordingly, the Company has adopted this ASU and evaluated the Company's ability to continue as a going concern as well as the need for related footnote disclosure. The Company has concluded no disclosure is necessary regarding the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nAs a percentage of revenue, total restaurant contribution decreased due to a 1.7% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses and a 0.8% increase in compensation and benefit costs, offset by a 1.0% decrease in food and beverage costs.\n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \nOur growth is based on the following strategies:\nNet cash flows used by financing activities increased $19.8 million from Fiscal 2015. In Fiscal 2015, the Company generated $259.4 million from the IPO and borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility, offset by the payoff of the 2012 Credit Facility, pre-payment penalty, debt issuance costs and payment of IPO costs. In Fiscal 2016, the Company made $15.0 million repayments under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2016 increased $18.7 million from Fiscal 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to an $8.6 million decrease in cash paid interest, an $8.2 million increase in cash related to the timing of collections of receivables and payments of liabilities, a $1.3 million decrease in pre-opening expenses, and a $0.7 million net increase in deferred revenue.\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\n (a) Estimated future payments attributable to our workers compensation reserve. Actual timing of payments may differ from the estimates above. \nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under ASC Topic 740, income taxes are accounted for based upon the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We estimate our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year-end. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of changes in accounting policies and we incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income. The assumptions we use are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased primarily due to a negative foreign exchange impact of $18.1 million and a $3.6 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue, offset by a $3.1 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 and the 53rd week impact of $0.8 million. On a constant currency and World Cup adjusted basis Brazil comparable restaurant sales increased 9.0%.\nAs a percentage of US restaurant revenue, contribution margin decreased due to a 0.1% decrease in food and beverage costs, a 0.2% decrease in occupancy and other operating expenses due to leverage on higher revenue, offset by a 0.4% increase in compensation and benefit costs attributable to the recognition of share-based compensation triggered by the IPO.\nBeginning in Fiscal 2013, the Company self-insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation claims and Company-sponsored employee health insurance programs. We estimate the accrued liabilities for all self-insurance programs at the end of each reporting period. Our estimate is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and actuarial assumptions. Beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, we engaged a third party actuary to assist us in estimating our liability for our workers' compensation claims. We elected to accrue the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims discounted based on the cash flow estimates provided by the actuary. Prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 we did not discount the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims. The discount on the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims as of January 1, 2017 is approximately $0.2 million. We believe that applying a discount to the estimated future cash flows provided by the actuarial analysis results in a more accurate estimate of the liability. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs is not discounted. The estimated liability for workers' compensation claims was $1.7 million as of January 1, 2017. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs was $0.3 million as of January 1, 2017.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased due to a $1.9 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million and the 53rd week impact of $0.8 million, offset by a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics and a $1.1 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. Brazil comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.5%.\n\n2015 Credit Facility\n (d) Future minimum lease payments attributable to all locations in Brazil contain annual escalations that are tied to the IGPM inflation index. These payments, which will be made in the functional currency of the country, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate and the prevailing IGPM index rate for 2017. Future minimum lease payments attributable to one location in Mexico contain annual escalations that are tied to the US CPI-U index. These payments, which will be made in the functional currency of the country, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate and the US CPI-U index rate existing at the time of the lease was executed. \nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d ASU 2016-09 requires among other things that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the new guidance provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. The Company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur as provided under ASU 2016-09. The adoption of this guidance did not a have material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn Fiscal 2016, we effectuated an internal restructuring whereby we created a new Dutch holding company, FDC Netherlands Cooperatief U.A. ( Fogo COOP\u201d) and contributed all of the Brazilian subsidiaries down below Fogo COOP. We then made contemporaneous check-the-box elections to treat these subsidiaries as disregarded entities or branches of Fogo COOP. For US federal income tax purposes, this transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D) or (F). Following, the internal restructuring, Fogo COOP is treated as the regarded or separate legal entity for US federal income tax purposes and the Brazilian entities are branches or divisions of Fogo COOP. Consequently, income or losses earned by the Brazilian entities are deemed to be earned by Fogo COOP for US federal income tax purposes. We consider the undistributed earnings related to Fogo COOP (and indirectly the earnings of its Brazilian disregarded entities as well as the earnings related to its majority interest in its Mexican joint ventures) to be indefinitely reinvested and expect them to continue to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, no provision for US income and additional foreign taxes has been recorded on aggregate undistributed earnings of $44.0 million as of January 1, 2017. If there is a change in assertion regarding indefinite or permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of our Dutch subsidiary, we would record a deferred tax liability attributable to those undistributed earnings in the amount of approximately $15.4 million. As of January 1, 2017, we had $31.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $21.7 million was held indirectly in Brazil by Fogo COOP's Brazilian disregarded entities, and $1.1 million was held directly in the Netherlands by Fogo COOP, which could be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the US.\nIntangible Assets\nSupplemental Selected Constant Currency Information\n (d) Consists primarily of non-cash charges resulting from the extinguishment/modification of our prior credit facilities. For Fiscal 2015, includes $0.3 million pre-payment premium and $0.1 million in legal and other expenses we paid in connection with the termination of our 2012 Credit Facility. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nTermination of the Advisory Services Agreement\nThe 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and authorize or pay dividends. In addition, we will be required to maintain two financial covenants, which include a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio (at levels that vary until maturity) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. At January 1, 2017, these required ratios were 5.50 to 1 and 2.00 to 1, respectively and the Company was in compliance with those covenants.\nAverage Check Per Person\nCompensation and benefit costs increased primarily due to a $4.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expenses, plus a $1.4 million increase in share-based compensation expense, primarily due to the recognition of share-based awards that were granted in 2012 through 2015 which had liquidity vesting conditions that were satisfied by the IPO, triggering the recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. Benefits cost including workers' compensation and healthcare claims costs increased by $1.9 million in Fiscal 2015. These increases were offset by a foreign exchange impact of $2.4 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased, primarily as a result of share-based compensation triggered by the IPO and reduced leverage on lower revenue in Brazil due to the 2014 World Cup benefit.\nRio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics which were held during the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. As a result, we estimate our two Rio de Janeiro restaurants contributed approximately $1.4 million of incremental revenue, as compared to Fiscal 2015.\n(dollars in thousands)\nGeneral and administrative costs increased primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in share-based compensation primarily due to share-based awards that were granted in 2012 through 2015 which had liquidity vesting conditions that were satisfied by the IPO triggering the recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 and a $7.5 million charge for the termination of the Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of THL in connection with the IPO. These increases were offset by positive foreign exchange impact of $0.9 million. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative costs increased from 8.2% to 12.0%.\n * Not meaningful. \nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of certain results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency by retranslating results across all prior periods presented using a derived exchange rate for the most current year periods presented based on actual results. The tables set forth below calculate constant currency at a foreign currency exchange rate of 3.4411 Brazilian reais to 1 US dollar, which represents the derived exchange rates for Fiscal 2016, calculated as explained above. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nKey Events\n (a) For Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, excludes $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of depreciation expense attributable to our joint venture in Mexico. \nWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and lease obligations. As of January 1, 2017, letters of credit and letters of guaranty totaling $4.9 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.\n2016 Summer Olympics\nAverage check per person is calculated by dividing total comparable restaurant sales by comparable restaurant guest counts for a given time period. Average check per person is influenced by menu prices and menu mix. Management uses this indicator to analyze trends in guests' preferences, the effectiveness of menu offerings and per guest expenditures.\nFood and Beverage Costs\n (h) Represents external professional service costs incurred as we assessed and initiated the process of becoming a public company. These costs include accounting and legal fees for public readiness services, documentation of internal controls to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and external auditor fees incurred for review of all fiscal quarters included in the registration statement. \nWe recognized income tax expense in Fiscal 2016 as compared to an income tax benefit in Fiscal 2015. The increase in income tax expense from Fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to the change in assertion with respect to undistributed foreign earnings and the release of a valuation allowance during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. We had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, we asserted that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis as a result of the IPO. Additionally, future US cash projections and our intent to continue investing in restaurants in foreign jurisdictions with cash generated in those jurisdictions, drove our decision to make the assertion. We also made the decision to release our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset. The decision to release the valuation allowance was triggered in conjunction with the IPO. Reduced debt service costs and historic cumulative earnings (US pretax income plus permanent tax differences) were all sources of positive evidence that led us to believe that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out of any extended transition period, and as a result we will seek to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nOur liquidity and capital requirements are principally the build-out cost of new restaurants, renovations of existing restaurants and corporate infrastructure, as well payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and lease obligations. We also require capital resources to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate support and information technology infrastructures. Our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, construction cost contributions from landlords when available to us (also known as tenant improvement allowances) and borrowings under our existing and previous credit facilities.\nWe believe we are in the early stages of our growth with 47 current restaurants, 35 in the US, including our newest domestic restaurant that we opened in Uptown Dallas, TX in February 2017, 10 in Brazil and two joint venture restaurants in Mexico. Based on internal analysis and a study prepared by an independent third party, we believe there is a long-term growth potential for more than 100 domestic sites, with additional new restaurants internationally. We have a long track record of successful new restaurant development, having grown our restaurant count by a multiple of 10 since 2000, and at a 12.7% CAGR since 2010. While new restaurants are expected to be a key driver of our growth, we believe positive comparable restaurant sales growth and margin expansion through leveraging our infrastructure will also contribute to strong future growth.\nDuring Fiscal 2015 we recorded an income tax benefit of $14.2 million primarily due to the reversal of $13.9 million in deferred tax liabilities. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2015, we determined that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would now be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. As a result of our change in assertion, we reduced our deferred tax liabilities attributable to those unremitted earnings and no longer provide for US income and additional foreign taxes related to the undistributed earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries. Additionally, the Company determined that it would realize its net deferred tax asset and as such, released its valuation allowance of $2.8 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nPre-opening costs increased $2.9 million to $4.9 million for Fiscal 2015. We opened seven restaurants during Fiscal 2015 and had an additional restaurant under construction during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 that opened in January 2016, compared to three openings during Fiscal 2014.\nWe operate our restaurants using a single restaurant concept and brand. Each restaurant under our single global brand operates with similar types of products and menu, providing a continuous service style, similar contracts, customers and employees, irrespective of location. We have identified two operating segments: US and Brazil, which is how we organize our restaurants for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Our joint venture in Mexico is included in the US for segment reporting purposes as the operations of the joint venture are monitored by the US segment management.\nUS restaurant revenue increased due to a $17.4 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, the 53rd week impact of $6.0 million and a $4.6 million increase in comparable restaurant revenue. US comparable restaurant sales increased 2.7%, primarily driven by an increase in guest traffic as a result of opening for lunch on Sunday nationwide beginning in May 2015.\n(dollars in thousands)\nAt our option, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans and bear interest at a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, respectively, plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate\u201d for any Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be between 50 and 150 basis points with respect to Base Rate Loans and between 150 and 250 basis points with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, depending on the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio. The current Applicable Rate will be (i) in the case of any Base Rate Loan 1.0% and in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, 2.0%.\nRestaurant contribution is defined as revenue less restaurant operating costs (which include food and beverage costs, compensation and benefits costs, and occupancy and certain other operating costs but exclude depreciation and amortization expense). Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of revenue. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. A reconciliation of restaurant contribution to revenue for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 is provided on page 51 and for Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 on page 54.\n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue. \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this, the amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The measurement of expected credit losses will be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The amendments in this ASU will be applied using a modified-retrospective approach and, for public entities, are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased due to a $4.0 million increase in non-comparable restaurant expense, the 53rd week impact of $0.6 million and a $0.5 million increase in comparable restaurant expense, offset by a positive foreign exchange impact of $3.0 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased, primarily due to increased occupancy costs for rent, CAM, taxes and insurance in the US and reduced leverage on lower revenue in Brazil due to the 2014 World Cup benefit.\nMarketing and advertising costs increased due to a larger revenue base and additional advertising expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total marketing and advertising expenses were essentially flat.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 820): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\u201d ASU 2015-02 provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation model. The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this new standard during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment during Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nPre-opening Costs\nNew Restaurant Openings\nThe following table presents the primary components of net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated.\nRestaurant openings reflect the number of new restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. We opened four restaurants during Fiscal 2016, including our second joint venture restaurant in Mexico City, which opened in October 2016. Over the next five years, we plan to increase our company-owned restaurant count by at least 10% annually, with North America being our primary market for new restaurant development. In addition, over the next five years, we plan to opportunistically open new\n52 vs. 53 Week Fiscal Year\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nOverview\n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth from time to time, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future.\nInsurance Reserves\n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \nRestaurant Development\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nRevenue\nInterest Expense\nDuring Fiscal 2016, we recognized a $0.3 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil.\nWe review property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If impairment exists, the amount of impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value, as determined by each location's projected future discounted cash flows. This assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives, which are subject to a significant degree of judgment. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. During Fiscal 2016, the Company recognized a $0.3 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil. We did not record any impairment related to long-lived assets in any of the other periods presented.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities increased $17.8 million from Fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily due to net proceeds from the sale of common stock during the IPO as well as proceeds from the draw on the 2015 Credit Facility, all offset by principal payments to extinguish the 2012 Credit Facility.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nIn connection with the closing of the IPO, we effected a stock split pursuant to which each share held by the holder of common stock was reclassified into 25.4588 shares. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated to give effect to the stock split.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. We test our indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment, through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. The estimated fair value is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to the assigned value of the Fogo de Ch\u00e3o trade name. Definite-lived intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements. The non-compete agreements are amortized over five years, which is the term of the agreements, and are measured for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in the same manner as long-lived assets. No impairments related to these intangible assets were recorded in any of the periods presented.\n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased due to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance owed and a reduction in interest rates due to using the proceeds of the IPO to pay down the 2012 Credit Facility. The IPO and subsequent payoff of the 2012 Credit Facility was completed on June 24, 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, interest expense, net of capitalized interest decreased from 6.8% to 3.7%.\n (i) Consists of non-cash portion of straight-line rent expense. \nIncome Taxes\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n \u2022 Grow our comparable restaurant sales; and \nAs of January 1, 2017, we had seven letters of credit outstanding for a total of $4.9 million and $95.1 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nFiscal 2015 (53 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2014 (52 Weeks)\n\nAverage Unit Volumes\n (k) Consists of non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil. \nFor Fiscal 2016, compared to Fiscal 2015, net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $2.9 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\nJOBS Act\nWe intend to spend approximately $26.0 million to $30.0 million in Fiscal 2017 on capital expenditures, including approximately $20.0 million to $22.0 million for new restaurant development and approximately $6.0 million to $8.0 million on opportunistic restaurant remodeling.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d The core principle of the standard is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. New qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements aim to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,\" which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one-year for all entities. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),\" in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,\" and in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,\" all of which provide additional clarification on certain topics addressed in ASU 2014-09. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. The Company has not yet selected a transition method or determined the effect, if any, that this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at January 1, 2017 on actual basis and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased due to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance owed and a reduction in interest rates following the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility that occurred during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nInterest Expense\nRestaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin\nWe believe that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties because they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. We use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, to evaluate our restaurant performance across periods and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared with our competitors.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGoodwill\nAs a result of the IPO, and the subsequent use of proceeds to pay down debt, we reviewed our position on indefinite reinvestment of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries' undistributed earnings pursuant to ASC 740-30-25 (formerly APB 23). Considering the significant reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis, along with our plan for future international growth, we determined that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would now be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. As a result of the change in assertion, we reduced our deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings by $13.9 million as a discrete item in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 and no longer provide for US income and additional foreign taxes related to undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries. If there is a change in assertion regarding indefinite reinvestment of undistributed earnings we would record a tax liability attributable to those undistributed earnings.\nStock Split\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization plus the sum of certain operating and non-operating expenses, including pre-opening costs, losses on modifications and extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation costs, management and consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges, one-time costs associated with the 2015 IPO, retention agreement costs, and other non-cash or similar adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. By monitoring and controlling our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we can gauge the overall profitability of our company. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nRecent Events in Brazil\nAdjusted EBITDA\n2015 Credit Facility\nFood and beverage costs increased due to a $7.5 million increase in food and beverage costs from non-comparable restaurants. However, the increase was offset by a $3.1 million decrease in comparable restaurant food and beverage costs, a $1.8 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased primarily due to reductions in protein commodity pricing, improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings and waste reduction efforts.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOperating Activities\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and certain definite life intangible assets. We depreciate capitalized leasehold improvements over the shorter of the total expected lease term or their estimated useful life.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because (i) we believe this measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors will find this measure useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin internally as a benchmark to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nInterest Income\nContractual Obligations\nLeases\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).\u201d ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility provides for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on June 24, 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nCompensation and benefits costs comprise restaurant and regional management salaries and bonuses, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-related expenses, including bonus expenses, share-based compensation, vacation pay, payroll taxes, fringe benefits and health insurance expenses and are measured by tracking hourly and total labor as a percentage of revenue.\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing are the number of new restaurant openings, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nFinancing Activities\n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue. \nDuring the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 we paid-off our 2012 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the IPO plus proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. As a result, we wrote off unamortized loan costs and unamortized original issue discounts, and paid a pre-payment penalty of $0.3 million for a total loss on the extinguishment of $6.0 million.\nInvesting Activities\nSignificant Components of Our Results of Operations\nWe believe that our cash from operations and borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our restaurants or systems such as our planned opportunistic restaurant remodel program, which we could fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations.\nTotal revenue increased due to a $27.6 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 and a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.8 million, a $4.2 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nFor Fiscal 2015, compared to Fiscal 2014, net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $9.9 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\n (j) For Fiscal 2016, amount includes $0.1 million of one-time legal and accounting fees and $0.3 million of one-time expenses related to the realignment of management of the Brazilian subsidiaries and the legal transfer of the Brazilian subsidiaries to the Company's Dutch holding company to support the Company's expansion into international markets. \nMarketing and advertising costs include all media, production and related costs for both local restaurant advertising and national marketing. We measure the efficiency of our marketing and advertising expenditures by tracking these costs as a percentage of total revenue.\n (b) Our Revolving Credit Facility does not require principal payments on any outstanding balance until June 24, 2020. \nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Operating Results\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday that is closest to December 31 of that year. Each fiscal year generally comprises four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. References to Fiscal 2016 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended January 1, 2017. References to Fiscal 2015 relate to our 53-week fiscal year ended January 3, 2016. References to Fiscal 2014 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended December 28, 2014.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nInitial Public Offering\nAdditionally, as a result of the IPO and reduced debt service costs, the Company reviewed its valuation allowance and determined that it was more likely than not that it would be able to realize its net deferred tax assets without regard to deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite lived intangibles. The Company analyzed sources of positive and negative evidence in determining whether it would release its valuation allowance. Ultimately, historic cumulative earnings, coupled with the Company's change in capital structure resulting from the IPO, led the Company to recognize its net deferred tax asset.\nExchange Rate Impact\nOn June 24, 2015 we paid-off our 2012 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the IPO plus proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. As a result, we wrote off unamortized loan costs and unamortized original issue discounts, and paid a pre-payment penalty of $0.3 million for a total loss on the extinguishment of $6.0 million. We had previously refinanced the 2012 Credit Facility in April 2014 to obtain a reduced interest rate and recorded a $3.1 million loss on the modification.\n\nWe consider a restaurant to be comparable during the first full fiscal quarter following the eighteenth full month of operations. We adjust the sales included in the comparable restaurant calculation for restaurant closures, primarily as a result of remodels, so that the periods will be comparable. Changes in comparable restaurant sales reflect changes in sales for the comparable group of restaurants over a specified period of time. Changes in comparable sales reflect changes in guest count trends as well as changes in average check per person, as described below. For Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, there were 35, 29 and 27 restaurants, respectively, in our calculations of comparable restaurant sales. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants, as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded.\nRevenue primarily consists of food and beverage sales, net of any employee meals and complimentary meals. Revenue is recognized when food and beverage products are sold at our restaurants net of any discounts. Revenue in a given period is directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of restaurants we operate and comparable restaurant sales growth. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards that do not have expiration dates are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of the sale and recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed by the holder. The portion of gift cards sold which are never redeemed is commonly referred to as gift card breakage. We recognize gift card breakage revenue for gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and we determine there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to governmental agencies.\n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \nFiscal 2016 (52 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2015 (53 Weeks)\n\n\nPre-opening costs decreased due to the timing of new restaurant development. During Fiscal 2016 we opened four restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that are due to open in Fiscal 2017. During Fiscal 2015 we opened seven restaurants and had an additional restaurant under construction at year-end that opened during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nAs a percentage of revenue, total restaurant contribution decreased due to reduced leverage on lower revenue due to lapping the 2014 World Cup.\nWe lease certain restaurant locations, storage spaces, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our restaurant leases generally have initial terms of between 10 and 20 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments. Our leases expire at various dates between 2017 and 2033, excluding extensions at our option. Some of our restaurant leases include renewal options, rent abatements and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Some of our leases also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table.\nFiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2014 contained 52 weeks whereas Fiscal 2015 contained 53 weeks. We estimate the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 contributed approximately $6.8 million of incremental revenue, as compared to Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2014. While certain expenses that were directly related to the incremental revenue increased, other expenses, such as fixed costs, were incurred on a calendar basis.\nGuest counts are measured by the number of entr\u00e9es ordered at our restaurants over a given time period. Examples of our entr\u00e9es include our Full Churrasco Experience, \u00e0 la carte seafood items, and Gaucho Lunch.\nOn June 24, 2015, we completed our initial public offering (\"IPO\") of 5,073,528 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, which included 661,764 shares of common stock sold to the underwriters pursuant to their option to purchase additional shares. After underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering costs, we received net proceeds from the IPO of $91.3 million. Proceeds from the IPO, together with borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our 2012 Credit Facility.\n(dollars in thousands)\n * Not meaningful. \nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized. We test our goodwill annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. We have identified two reporting units, the US and Brazil, based on the geography of the Company's operations to which goodwill is attributable. The impairment evaluation is conducted annually using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess or carrying value over fair value. No impairment to goodwill was recorded during any of the periods presented.\n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \nRestaurant Contribution\nAs a percentage of Brazil restaurant revenue, contribution margin decreased due to a 0.2% increase in food and beverage costs, a 1.1% increase in compensation and benefit costs due to reduced leverage on lower revenue due to lapping the 2014 World Cup, and a 1.5% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses due to reduced leverage on lower revenue due to lapping the 2014 World Cup.\n (g) Consists of cash payments to our regional managers pursuant to retention and non-compete agreements executed in 2012. The final payments under these agreements were paid in October 2015. \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\u201d The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nGeneral and administrative costs are comprised of costs related to certain corporate and administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations. These expenses are generally fixed and reflect management, supervisory and staff salaries, employee benefits and bonuses, share-based compensation, travel expense, information systems, training, corporate rent, technology, market research, and professional and consulting fees, including fees related to the implementation of, and compliance with, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We measure general and administrative costs by tracking general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue.\nPerformance Indicators\nAs a percentage of Brazil restaurant revenue, restaurant contribution margin decreased due to a 2.0% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses due to increased fixed occupancy costs, offset by a 0.6% decrease in food and beverage costs due to waste reduction efforts and a 0.2% decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in share-based compensation expense.\nOur consolidated effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to foreign earnings being subjected to taxation at lower tax rates, FICA tax credits, state income taxes, and nondeductible equity-based compensation.\n \u2022 Grow our restaurant base; \nPre-opening Costs\nAs a result of the IPO, we terminated our Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and paid a one-time non-recurring payment of $7.5 million in connection with the termination during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. While we have benefitted from savings on management fees that we incurred as a private company, these benefits have been offset by the incremental costs we incurred as a public company such as legal, accounting, insurance and other compliance costs.\nRestaurant Contribution\nrestaurants in Brazil as attractive real estate locations become available. We will pursue growth in international markets through a combination of company-owned restaurants and joint ventures, which we believe allows us to expand our brand with limited capital investment by us. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nCompensation and benefit costs increased due to a $9.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expenses and a $0.2 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expenses, offset by a $1.7 million decrease in cumulative share-based compensation expense primarily recognized in conjunction with the IPO in Fiscal 2015, a $1.4 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings as our management teams become more accustomed to predicting, managing and servicing the sales volumes of their new restaurants. The increase is also being driven by investments in third managers as well as increases in minimum wages and group health insurance claims.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d section of this annual report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this annual report and included elsewhere in this annual report. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section and included elsewhere in this annual report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nAs a percentage of US restaurant revenue, restaurant contribution margin decreased due to a 1.7% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses due to increased fixed occupancy costs, and a 0.9% increase in compensation and benefit costs due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings, investments in third managers, and increases in minimum wages and group health insurance claims, offset by a 0.9% decrease in food and beverage costs due to reductions in protein commodity pricing and improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings.\n (c) The table above assumes an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.75% on our Revolving Credit Facility with an annual increase of 25 bps, plus annual administrative agent fees and fees incurred on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. \nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740).\u201d This update requires that entities with a classified balance sheet present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. This update can be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as of July 3, 2016 on a retrospective basis resulting in a reclassification of $2.9 million of current deferred tax assets against non-current deferred tax liabilities of $16.0 million as of January 3, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.\nFood and beverage costs increased primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in food and beverage costs from non-comparable restaurants and a 53rd week impact of $1.8 million, offset by a positive foreign exchange impact of $6.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased, primarily due to initiatives to reduce waste and introduce lower cost seasonal menu offerings.\n * Not meaningful. \n(dollars in thousands)\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nWe operate the majority of our restaurants in leased premises. We record the minimum base rents including option periods which in the judgement of management are reasonably assured of renewal. In determining whether an option period is reasonably assured for renewal we consider the capital outlay required for a location and our target return on that investment. For purposes of calculating straight-line rents, the lease term commences on the date we obtain control of the property, which is normally when the property is ready for normal tenant improvements (build-out period). The difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as a deferred rent liability. Allowances for tenant improvements are included in the deferred rent liability and recognized over the life of the lease by reducing rent expense.\nOur ability to successfully open new restaurants and expand our restaurant base is critical to adding revenue capacity to meet our goals for growth. New restaurant openings contribute additional operating weeks and revenue to our business. Before a new restaurant opens, we incur pre-opening costs, as described below. New restaurants often open with an initial start-up period of sales volatility. Operating margins tend to stabilize within twelve months of opening. New restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher food, labor and other direct operating expenses and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. To achieve our goal to successfully open new restaurants, we consider a number of factors including macro and micro economic conditions, availability of appropriate locations, competition in local markets, and the availability of teams to manage new locations. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nOperating Leases and Deferred Rent\n\nGrowth Strategies and Outlook\nWe experienced lower and stable beef prices in Fiscal 2016, which allowed us to improve food costs as compared to Fiscal 2015. However, in Fiscal 2016 the food-at-home (grocery store or supermarket food items) CPI in the US decreased 1.3% as compared to Fiscal 2015 which marked the first annual decline since 1967.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements, requiring an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs attributable to line-of-credit arrangements after the adoption of ASU 2015-03. In particular, ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of such arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of April 3, 2016. The Company's financial statement presentation was consistent with the guidance in ASU 2015-15. As a result, there was no impact to the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon adoption. Unamortized debt issuance costs as of January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, which are attributable to the Company's 2015 Credit Facility (revolving line-of-credit), are included in other assets (noncurrent) in the consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue. \nTotal revenue increased due to a $20.5 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, the 53rd week impact of $6.8 million and a $1.0 million increase in comparable restaurant revenue, offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of $18.1 million and a $0.7 million decrease in other revenue. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 7.2% due to the 2014 World Cup benefit.\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant expenses and a $2.0 million increase in comparable restaurant expenses, offset by a $0.6 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.3 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased as a result of increased fixed occupancy costs on lower revenue.\nCommodity Pricing\nCertain share-based awards granted from 2012 through 2015 include vesting conditions that require both (i) completion of a four or five-year vesting period and (ii) satisfaction of a Liquidity Event, as defined in the applicable award agreement. Under the terms of those agreements, a Liquidity Event is defined as the earlier to occur of (i) a change in control transaction or (ii) an initial public offering. Upon the closing of the IPO, options for the purchase of 783,606 shares of common stock vested as a result of the satisfaction of the Liquidity Event vesting condition. The Company recognized $5.7 million of compensation expense associated with these options during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\n (b) For Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, excludes $0.03 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of income tax expense attributable to our joint venture in Mexico. \nGuest Counts\nFood and Beverage Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs increased primarily due to a planned increase in advertising spend on digital marketing. As a percentage of total revenue, marketing and advertising costs increased from 2.1% to 2.4%.\nWe experienced significant foreign currency impact during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 due to fluctuations of the Brazilian Real relative to the US dollar. When the US dollar strengthens compared to the Brazilian Real, it has a negative impact on our Brazilian operating results upon translation of those results into US dollars for the purposes of consolidation. We anticipate continued foreign currency volatility throughout Fiscal 2017 with respect to the Brazilian Real. See Supplemental Selected Constant Currency Information\u201d on page 56 for the exchange rate impact on current financial periods.\nGeneral and administrative costs decreased due to the 2015 recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter triggered by the IPO in the amount of $4.3 million, as well as a one-time charge of $7.5 million for the disposition of the Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of THL in connection with the IPO and a $1.2 million decrease in corporate compensation expense. These decreases were offset by a $0.3 million increase in insurance, a $0.3 million increase in corporate travel and a $0.2 million increase in tax consulting expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total general and administrative costs decreased as a result of lapping IPO related expenses from Fiscal 2015.\nOn June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into the 2015 Credit Facility. Upon the closing of the IPO, we drew $165.0 million on the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from the IPO, to repay the outstanding debt under the 2012 Credit Facility.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nIncome tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we operate. Historically we have generated taxable income in the US and Brazil. Our provision includes federal, state and local, and foreign current and deferred income tax expense.\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2015 a series of protests began in Brazil against the Brazilian government and its President. The initial protests occurred in cities throughout Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paolo, and continued throughout the remainder of Fiscal 2015. In March 2016 there were additional anti-government and anti-corruption protests throughout Brazil. During the latter half of Fiscal 2016, the former President of Brazil was impeached and protests occurred in a number of cities in response to government austerity plans. As a result of the protests and political unrest, our restaurants in Brazil experienced reduced guest traffic in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. It is possible that further protests or other social unrest, political activity or political instability may occur in Brazil, which could impact our guest traffic, thereby affecting our revenue and net income. In addition to the uncertain political environment and events discussed above, Brazil continues to suffer from a protracted economic recession that negatively impacts our guests.\n \u2022 Improve margins by leveraging our infrastructure and investments in human capital. \nFogo de Ch\u00e3o (fogo-dee-shoun) is a leading Brazilian steakhouse, or churrascaria, which has specialized for more than 37 years in fire-roasting high-quality meats utilizing the centuries-old Southern Brazilian cooking technique of churrasco. We deliver a distinctive and authentic Brazilian dining experience through the combination of our high-quality Brazilian cuisine and our differentiated service model known as espeto corrido (Portuguese for continuous service\u201d) delivered by our churrasqueiros, which we refer to as our gaucho chefs. We offer our guests a variety of menu choices including our most popular offering the Full Churrasco Experience as well Gaucho Lunch, Weekend Brazilian Brunch and Bar Fogo menu items. The Full Churrasco Experience, our prix fixe menu, provides the opportunity to experience a variety of meats including beef, lamb, pork and chicken, simply seasoned and carefully fire-roasted to expose their natural flavors as well as a selection of fresh seasonal salads and specialty items at the Market Table.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nWe had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, the Company asserted that undistributed net earnings of its Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis as a result of the IPO. Additionally, future US cash projections and the Company's intent to continue investing in restaurants in foreign jurisdictions with cash generated in those jurisdictions drove the decision to make the assertion. Because we consider the undistributed earnings related to our Brazilian subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and are expected to continue to be indefinitely reinvested, no provision for US income and additional foreign taxes is recorded on the aggregate undistributed earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries.\nWe recognize tax liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, and adjust those liabilities when judgments change as a result of evaluation of new information not previously available. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of our tax liabilities. These differences are reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\nLoss on Extinguishment / Modification of Debt\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering which will be June 2020, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nOccupancy and other operating expenses comprise all occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, utility costs, credit card fees, real estate property and other related taxes and other related restaurant supply and occupancy costs, but exclude depreciation and amortization expense, and are measured by tracking occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nIncome Taxes\n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \nWe measure average unit volumes ( AUVs\u201d) on an annual (52-week) basis. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, we exclude the 53rd week from the AUV calculation for consistency purposes. AUVs consist of the average sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. We adjust the sales included in AUV calculations for restaurant closures. This measurement allows us to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base.\n\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nRecently issued accounting standards not included below are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nSegment Reporting\n (f) Consists primarily of payments to an affiliate of THL and advisors engaged by an affiliate of THL for advisory and consulting services. For Fiscal 2015, includes the $7.5 million fee paid to an affiliate of THL as a result of the termination of the advisory services agreement with that affiliate. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nRevenue\nIn this section and other parts of this Form 10-K, we refer to certain measures used for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We also may refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), but have corresponding GAAP-based measures. Where non-GAAP measures appear, we provide tables reconciling these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP-based measures and make reference to a discussion of their use. We believe these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) it does not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) it does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) it does not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income is provided on page 55.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\n (c) For Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, excludes $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of pre-opening costs incurred by our joint venture in Mexico. For Fiscal 2014, excludes $0.2 million of pre-opening costs incurred by our joint venture in Mexico. \nIncome Tax Expense", "item_7_text": "Concurrently with the consummation of our IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into a new $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility\u201d). Loans under the 2015 Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% or at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50% and will mature in 2020. The 2015 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including financial maintenance covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the underlying credit facility agreement). Starting in Fiscal 2017 and through Fiscal 2018, the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio may not be greater than 5.25 to 1 and the ratio will further reduce to 5.0 to 1 in Fiscal 2019, through maturity. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio may not be less than 2.00 to 1. Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility may vary significantly from time to time depending on our cash needs at any given time. Upon the consummation of our IPO we drew $165.0 million under the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from our IPO, to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility. We recorded a loss of $6.0 million on the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as the valuation of long-lived, definite and indefinite-lived assets, estimated useful lives of assets, the reasonably assured lease terms of operating leases, valuation of the workers' compensation and Company-sponsored employee health insurance program liabilities, and deferred tax valuation allowances, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2015 decreased $4.7 million from Fiscal 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a $7.5 million fee paid to an affiliate of THL as a result of the termination of the advisory services agreement with that affiliate and a $2.9 million increase in pre-opening expenses, all offset by a $4.1 million decrease in cash paid for interest, a $0.6 million decrease in cash paid for income taxes net of refunds, a $0.6 million net increase in deferred revenue and a $0.4 million decrease in inventories.\n\nFood and beverage costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and distribution of our menu items. We measure food and beverage costs by tracking the cost as a percentage of revenue. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue are generally influenced by the cost of food and beverage items, distribution costs and sales mix. These components are variable in nature, increase with revenue, are subject to increases or decreases based on fluctuations in commodity costs, including beef, lamb, pork, chicken and seafood prices, and depend in part on the controls we have in place to manage costs at our restaurants.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Fogo de Ch\u00e3o, Inc. (dollars in thousands).\nComparable Restaurant Sales\n (e) For Fiscal 2015, includes $5.7 million of compensation expense recognized upon the closing of the IPO attributable to the vesting of stock options. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nPre-opening Costs\nInterest income increased due to increased cash and cash equivalents in Brazil and favorable interest rates earned on those balances.\nUS restaurant revenue increased due to a $26.5 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.0 million and a $2.3 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue. US comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\u201d which clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current GAAP. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows.\nPre-opening costs are costs incurred prior to, and directly associated with, opening a restaurant, and primarily consist of manager salaries, relocation costs, recruiting expenses, employee payroll and related training costs for new employees, including rehearsal of service activities, as well as straight-line lease costs incurred prior to opening. In addition, pre-opening costs include public relations costs incurred prior to opening. We typically start incurring pre-opening costs four to six months prior to opening and these costs tend to increase four weeks prior to opening as we begin training activities.\n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n * Not meaningful. \nRevenue\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued and requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, ending after December 15, 2016. Accordingly, the Company has adopted this ASU and evaluated the Company's ability to continue as a going concern as well as the need for related footnote disclosure. The Company has concluded no disclosure is necessary regarding the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nAs a percentage of revenue, total restaurant contribution decreased due to a 1.7% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses and a 0.8% increase in compensation and benefit costs, offset by a 1.0% decrease in food and beverage costs.\n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \nOur growth is based on the following strategies:\nNet cash flows used by financing activities increased $19.8 million from Fiscal 2015. In Fiscal 2015, the Company generated $259.4 million from the IPO and borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility, offset by the payoff of the 2012 Credit Facility, pre-payment penalty, debt issuance costs and payment of IPO costs. In Fiscal 2016, the Company made $15.0 million repayments under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2016 increased $18.7 million from Fiscal 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to an $8.6 million decrease in cash paid interest, an $8.2 million increase in cash related to the timing of collections of receivables and payments of liabilities, a $1.3 million decrease in pre-opening expenses, and a $0.7 million net increase in deferred revenue.\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\n (a) Estimated future payments attributable to our workers compensation reserve. Actual timing of payments may differ from the estimates above. \nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under ASC Topic 740, income taxes are accounted for based upon the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We estimate our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year-end. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of changes in accounting policies and we incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income. The assumptions we use are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased primarily due to a negative foreign exchange impact of $18.1 million and a $3.6 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue, offset by a $3.1 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 and the 53rd week impact of $0.8 million. On a constant currency and World Cup adjusted basis Brazil comparable restaurant sales increased 9.0%.\nAs a percentage of US restaurant revenue, contribution margin decreased due to a 0.1% decrease in food and beverage costs, a 0.2% decrease in occupancy and other operating expenses due to leverage on higher revenue, offset by a 0.4% increase in compensation and benefit costs attributable to the recognition of share-based compensation triggered by the IPO.\nBeginning in Fiscal 2013, the Company self-insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation claims and Company-sponsored employee health insurance programs. We estimate the accrued liabilities for all self-insurance programs at the end of each reporting period. Our estimate is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and actuarial assumptions. Beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, we engaged a third party actuary to assist us in estimating our liability for our workers' compensation claims. We elected to accrue the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims discounted based on the cash flow estimates provided by the actuary. Prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 we did not discount the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims. The discount on the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims as of January 1, 2017 is approximately $0.2 million. We believe that applying a discount to the estimated future cash flows provided by the actuarial analysis results in a more accurate estimate of the liability. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs is not discounted. The estimated liability for workers' compensation claims was $1.7 million as of January 1, 2017. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs was $0.3 million as of January 1, 2017.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased due to a $1.9 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million and the 53rd week impact of $0.8 million, offset by a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics and a $1.1 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. Brazil comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.5%.\n\n2015 Credit Facility\n (d) Future minimum lease payments attributable to all locations in Brazil contain annual escalations that are tied to the IGPM inflation index. These payments, which will be made in the functional currency of the country, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate and the prevailing IGPM index rate for 2017. Future minimum lease payments attributable to one location in Mexico contain annual escalations that are tied to the US CPI-U index. These payments, which will be made in the functional currency of the country, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate and the US CPI-U index rate existing at the time of the lease was executed. \nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d ASU 2016-09 requires among other things that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the new guidance provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. The Company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur as provided under ASU 2016-09. The adoption of this guidance did not a have material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn Fiscal 2016, we effectuated an internal restructuring whereby we created a new Dutch holding company, FDC Netherlands Cooperatief U.A. ( Fogo COOP\u201d) and contributed all of the Brazilian subsidiaries down below Fogo COOP. We then made contemporaneous check-the-box elections to treat these subsidiaries as disregarded entities or branches of Fogo COOP. For US federal income tax purposes, this transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D) or (F). Following, the internal restructuring, Fogo COOP is treated as the regarded or separate legal entity for US federal income tax purposes and the Brazilian entities are branches or divisions of Fogo COOP. Consequently, income or losses earned by the Brazilian entities are deemed to be earned by Fogo COOP for US federal income tax purposes. We consider the undistributed earnings related to Fogo COOP (and indirectly the earnings of its Brazilian disregarded entities as well as the earnings related to its majority interest in its Mexican joint ventures) to be indefinitely reinvested and expect them to continue to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, no provision for US income and additional foreign taxes has been recorded on aggregate undistributed earnings of $44.0 million as of January 1, 2017. If there is a change in assertion regarding indefinite or permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of our Dutch subsidiary, we would record a deferred tax liability attributable to those undistributed earnings in the amount of approximately $15.4 million. As of January 1, 2017, we had $31.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $21.7 million was held indirectly in Brazil by Fogo COOP's Brazilian disregarded entities, and $1.1 million was held directly in the Netherlands by Fogo COOP, which could be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the US.\nIntangible Assets\nSupplemental Selected Constant Currency Information\n (d) Consists primarily of non-cash charges resulting from the extinguishment/modification of our prior credit facilities. For Fiscal 2015, includes $0.3 million pre-payment premium and $0.1 million in legal and other expenses we paid in connection with the termination of our 2012 Credit Facility. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nTermination of the Advisory Services Agreement\nThe 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and authorize or pay dividends. In addition, we will be required to maintain two financial covenants, which include a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio (at levels that vary until maturity) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. At January 1, 2017, these required ratios were 5.50 to 1 and 2.00 to 1, respectively and the Company was in compliance with those covenants.\nAverage Check Per Person\nCompensation and benefit costs increased primarily due to a $4.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expenses, plus a $1.4 million increase in share-based compensation expense, primarily due to the recognition of share-based awards that were granted in 2012 through 2015 which had liquidity vesting conditions that were satisfied by the IPO, triggering the recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. Benefits cost including workers' compensation and healthcare claims costs increased by $1.9 million in Fiscal 2015. These increases were offset by a foreign exchange impact of $2.4 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased, primarily as a result of share-based compensation triggered by the IPO and reduced leverage on lower revenue in Brazil due to the 2014 World Cup benefit.\nRio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics which were held during the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. As a result, we estimate our two Rio de Janeiro restaurants contributed approximately $1.4 million of incremental revenue, as compared to Fiscal 2015.\n(dollars in thousands)\nGeneral and administrative costs increased primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in share-based compensation primarily due to share-based awards that were granted in 2012 through 2015 which had liquidity vesting conditions that were satisfied by the IPO triggering the recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 and a $7.5 million charge for the termination of the Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of THL in connection with the IPO. These increases were offset by positive foreign exchange impact of $0.9 million. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative costs increased from 8.2% to 12.0%.\n * Not meaningful. \nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of certain results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency by retranslating results across all prior periods presented using a derived exchange rate for the most current year periods presented based on actual results. The tables set forth below calculate constant currency at a foreign currency exchange rate of 3.4411 Brazilian reais to 1 US dollar, which represents the derived exchange rates for Fiscal 2016, calculated as explained above. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nKey Events\n (a) For Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, excludes $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of depreciation expense attributable to our joint venture in Mexico. \nWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and lease obligations. As of January 1, 2017, letters of credit and letters of guaranty totaling $4.9 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.\n2016 Summer Olympics\nAverage check per person is calculated by dividing total comparable restaurant sales by comparable restaurant guest counts for a given time period. Average check per person is influenced by menu prices and menu mix. Management uses this indicator to analyze trends in guests' preferences, the effectiveness of menu offerings and per guest expenditures.\nFood and Beverage Costs\n (h) Represents external professional service costs incurred as we assessed and initiated the process of becoming a public company. These costs include accounting and legal fees for public readiness services, documentation of internal controls to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and external auditor fees incurred for review of all fiscal quarters included in the registration statement. \nWe recognized income tax expense in Fiscal 2016 as compared to an income tax benefit in Fiscal 2015. The increase in income tax expense from Fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to the change in assertion with respect to undistributed foreign earnings and the release of a valuation allowance during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. We had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, we asserted that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis as a result of the IPO. Additionally, future US cash projections and our intent to continue investing in restaurants in foreign jurisdictions with cash generated in those jurisdictions, drove our decision to make the assertion. We also made the decision to release our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset. The decision to release the valuation allowance was triggered in conjunction with the IPO. Reduced debt service costs and historic cumulative earnings (US pretax income plus permanent tax differences) were all sources of positive evidence that led us to believe that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out of any extended transition period, and as a result we will seek to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nOur liquidity and capital requirements are principally the build-out cost of new restaurants, renovations of existing restaurants and corporate infrastructure, as well payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and lease obligations. We also require capital resources to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate support and information technology infrastructures. Our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, construction cost contributions from landlords when available to us (also known as tenant improvement allowances) and borrowings under our existing and previous credit facilities.\nWe believe we are in the early stages of our growth with 47 current restaurants, 35 in the US, including our newest domestic restaurant that we opened in Uptown Dallas, TX in February 2017, 10 in Brazil and two joint venture restaurants in Mexico. Based on internal analysis and a study prepared by an independent third party, we believe there is a long-term growth potential for more than 100 domestic sites, with additional new restaurants internationally. We have a long track record of successful new restaurant development, having grown our restaurant count by a multiple of 10 since 2000, and at a 12.7% CAGR since 2010. While new restaurants are expected to be a key driver of our growth, we believe positive comparable restaurant sales growth and margin expansion through leveraging our infrastructure will also contribute to strong future growth.\nDuring Fiscal 2015 we recorded an income tax benefit of $14.2 million primarily due to the reversal of $13.9 million in deferred tax liabilities. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2015, we determined that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would now be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. As a result of our change in assertion, we reduced our deferred tax liabilities attributable to those unremitted earnings and no longer provide for US income and additional foreign taxes related to the undistributed earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries. Additionally, the Company determined that it would realize its net deferred tax asset and as such, released its valuation allowance of $2.8 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nPre-opening costs increased $2.9 million to $4.9 million for Fiscal 2015. We opened seven restaurants during Fiscal 2015 and had an additional restaurant under construction during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 that opened in January 2016, compared to three openings during Fiscal 2014.\nWe operate our restaurants using a single restaurant concept and brand. Each restaurant under our single global brand operates with similar types of products and menu, providing a continuous service style, similar contracts, customers and employees, irrespective of location. We have identified two operating segments: US and Brazil, which is how we organize our restaurants for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Our joint venture in Mexico is included in the US for segment reporting purposes as the operations of the joint venture are monitored by the US segment management.\nUS restaurant revenue increased due to a $17.4 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, the 53rd week impact of $6.0 million and a $4.6 million increase in comparable restaurant revenue. US comparable restaurant sales increased 2.7%, primarily driven by an increase in guest traffic as a result of opening for lunch on Sunday nationwide beginning in May 2015.\n(dollars in thousands)\nAt our option, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans and bear interest at a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, respectively, plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate\u201d for any Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be between 50 and 150 basis points with respect to Base Rate Loans and between 150 and 250 basis points with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, depending on the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio. The current Applicable Rate will be (i) in the case of any Base Rate Loan 1.0% and in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, 2.0%.\nRestaurant contribution is defined as revenue less restaurant operating costs (which include food and beverage costs, compensation and benefits costs, and occupancy and certain other operating costs but exclude depreciation and amortization expense). Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of revenue. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. A reconciliation of restaurant contribution to revenue for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 is provided on page 51 and for Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 on page 54.\n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue. \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this, the amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The measurement of expected credit losses will be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The amendments in this ASU will be applied using a modified-retrospective approach and, for public entities, are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased due to a $4.0 million increase in non-comparable restaurant expense, the 53rd week impact of $0.6 million and a $0.5 million increase in comparable restaurant expense, offset by a positive foreign exchange impact of $3.0 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased, primarily due to increased occupancy costs for rent, CAM, taxes and insurance in the US and reduced leverage on lower revenue in Brazil due to the 2014 World Cup benefit.\nMarketing and advertising costs increased due to a larger revenue base and additional advertising expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total marketing and advertising expenses were essentially flat.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 820): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\u201d ASU 2015-02 provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation model. The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this new standard during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment during Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nPre-opening Costs\nNew Restaurant Openings\nThe following table presents the primary components of net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated.\nRestaurant openings reflect the number of new restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. We opened four restaurants during Fiscal 2016, including our second joint venture restaurant in Mexico City, which opened in October 2016. Over the next five years, we plan to increase our company-owned restaurant count by at least 10% annually, with North America being our primary market for new restaurant development. In addition, over the next five years, we plan to opportunistically open new\n52 vs. 53 Week Fiscal Year\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nOverview\n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth from time to time, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future.\nInsurance Reserves\n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \nRestaurant Development\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nRevenue\nInterest Expense\nDuring Fiscal 2016, we recognized a $0.3 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil.\nWe review property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If impairment exists, the amount of impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value, as determined by each location's projected future discounted cash flows. This assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives, which are subject to a significant degree of judgment. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. During Fiscal 2016, the Company recognized a $0.3 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil. We did not record any impairment related to long-lived assets in any of the other periods presented.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities increased $17.8 million from Fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily due to net proceeds from the sale of common stock during the IPO as well as proceeds from the draw on the 2015 Credit Facility, all offset by principal payments to extinguish the 2012 Credit Facility.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nIn connection with the closing of the IPO, we effected a stock split pursuant to which each share held by the holder of common stock was reclassified into 25.4588 shares. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated to give effect to the stock split.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. We test our indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment, through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. The estimated fair value is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to the assigned value of the Fogo de Ch\u00e3o trade name. Definite-lived intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements. The non-compete agreements are amortized over five years, which is the term of the agreements, and are measured for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in the same manner as long-lived assets. No impairments related to these intangible assets were recorded in any of the periods presented.\n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased due to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance owed and a reduction in interest rates due to using the proceeds of the IPO to pay down the 2012 Credit Facility. The IPO and subsequent payoff of the 2012 Credit Facility was completed on June 24, 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, interest expense, net of capitalized interest decreased from 6.8% to 3.7%.\n (i) Consists of non-cash portion of straight-line rent expense. \nIncome Taxes\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n \u2022 Grow our comparable restaurant sales; and \nAs of January 1, 2017, we had seven letters of credit outstanding for a total of $4.9 million and $95.1 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nFiscal 2015 (53 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2014 (52 Weeks)\n\nAverage Unit Volumes\n (k) Consists of non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil. \nFor Fiscal 2016, compared to Fiscal 2015, net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $2.9 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\nJOBS Act\nWe intend to spend approximately $26.0 million to $30.0 million in Fiscal 2017 on capital expenditures, including approximately $20.0 million to $22.0 million for new restaurant development and approximately $6.0 million to $8.0 million on opportunistic restaurant remodeling.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d The core principle of the standard is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. New qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements aim to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,\" which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one-year for all entities. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),\" in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,\" and in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,\" all of which provide additional clarification on certain topics addressed in ASU 2014-09. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. The Company has not yet selected a transition method or determined the effect, if any, that this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at January 1, 2017 on actual basis and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased due to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance owed and a reduction in interest rates following the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility that occurred during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nInterest Expense\nRestaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin\nWe believe that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties because they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. We use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, to evaluate our restaurant performance across periods and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared with our competitors.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGoodwill\nAs a result of the IPO, and the subsequent use of proceeds to pay down debt, we reviewed our position on indefinite reinvestment of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries' undistributed earnings pursuant to ASC 740-30-25 (formerly APB 23). Considering the significant reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis, along with our plan for future international growth, we determined that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would now be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. As a result of the change in assertion, we reduced our deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings by $13.9 million as a discrete item in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 and no longer provide for US income and additional foreign taxes related to undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries. If there is a change in assertion regarding indefinite reinvestment of undistributed earnings we would record a tax liability attributable to those undistributed earnings.\nStock Split\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization plus the sum of certain operating and non-operating expenses, including pre-opening costs, losses on modifications and extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation costs, management and consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges, one-time costs associated with the 2015 IPO, retention agreement costs, and other non-cash or similar adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. By monitoring and controlling our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we can gauge the overall profitability of our company. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nRecent Events in Brazil\nAdjusted EBITDA\n2015 Credit Facility\nFood and beverage costs increased due to a $7.5 million increase in food and beverage costs from non-comparable restaurants. However, the increase was offset by a $3.1 million decrease in comparable restaurant food and beverage costs, a $1.8 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased primarily due to reductions in protein commodity pricing, improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings and waste reduction efforts.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOperating Activities\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and certain definite life intangible assets. We depreciate capitalized leasehold improvements over the shorter of the total expected lease term or their estimated useful life.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because (i) we believe this measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors will find this measure useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin internally as a benchmark to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nInterest Income\nContractual Obligations\nLeases\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).\u201d ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility provides for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on June 24, 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nCompensation and benefits costs comprise restaurant and regional management salaries and bonuses, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-related expenses, including bonus expenses, share-based compensation, vacation pay, payroll taxes, fringe benefits and health insurance expenses and are measured by tracking hourly and total labor as a percentage of revenue.\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing are the number of new restaurant openings, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nFinancing Activities\n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue. \nDuring the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 we paid-off our 2012 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the IPO plus proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. As a result, we wrote off unamortized loan costs and unamortized original issue discounts, and paid a pre-payment penalty of $0.3 million for a total loss on the extinguishment of $6.0 million.\nInvesting Activities\nSignificant Components of Our Results of Operations\nWe believe that our cash from operations and borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our restaurants or systems such as our planned opportunistic restaurant remodel program, which we could fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations.\nTotal revenue increased due to a $27.6 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 and a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.8 million, a $4.2 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nFor Fiscal 2015, compared to Fiscal 2014, net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $9.9 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\n (j) For Fiscal 2016, amount includes $0.1 million of one-time legal and accounting fees and $0.3 million of one-time expenses related to the realignment of management of the Brazilian subsidiaries and the legal transfer of the Brazilian subsidiaries to the Company's Dutch holding company to support the Company's expansion into international markets. \nMarketing and advertising costs include all media, production and related costs for both local restaurant advertising and national marketing. We measure the efficiency of our marketing and advertising expenditures by tracking these costs as a percentage of total revenue.\n (b) Our Revolving Credit Facility does not require principal payments on any outstanding balance until June 24, 2020. \nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Operating Results\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday that is closest to December 31 of that year. Each fiscal year generally comprises four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. References to Fiscal 2016 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended January 1, 2017. References to Fiscal 2015 relate to our 53-week fiscal year ended January 3, 2016. References to Fiscal 2014 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended December 28, 2014.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nInitial Public Offering\nAdditionally, as a result of the IPO and reduced debt service costs, the Company reviewed its valuation allowance and determined that it was more likely than not that it would be able to realize its net deferred tax assets without regard to deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite lived intangibles. The Company analyzed sources of positive and negative evidence in determining whether it would release its valuation allowance. Ultimately, historic cumulative earnings, coupled with the Company's change in capital structure resulting from the IPO, led the Company to recognize its net deferred tax asset.\nExchange Rate Impact\nOn June 24, 2015 we paid-off our 2012 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the IPO plus proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. As a result, we wrote off unamortized loan costs and unamortized original issue discounts, and paid a pre-payment penalty of $0.3 million for a total loss on the extinguishment of $6.0 million. We had previously refinanced the 2012 Credit Facility in April 2014 to obtain a reduced interest rate and recorded a $3.1 million loss on the modification.\n\nWe consider a restaurant to be comparable during the first full fiscal quarter following the eighteenth full month of operations. We adjust the sales included in the comparable restaurant calculation for restaurant closures, primarily as a result of remodels, so that the periods will be comparable. Changes in comparable restaurant sales reflect changes in sales for the comparable group of restaurants over a specified period of time. Changes in comparable sales reflect changes in guest count trends as well as changes in average check per person, as described below. For Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, there were 35, 29 and 27 restaurants, respectively, in our calculations of comparable restaurant sales. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants, as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded.\nRevenue primarily consists of food and beverage sales, net of any employee meals and complimentary meals. Revenue is recognized when food and beverage products are sold at our restaurants net of any discounts. Revenue in a given period is directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of restaurants we operate and comparable restaurant sales growth. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards that do not have expiration dates are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of the sale and recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed by the holder. The portion of gift cards sold which are never redeemed is commonly referred to as gift card breakage. We recognize gift card breakage revenue for gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and we determine there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to governmental agencies.\n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \nFiscal 2016 (52 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2015 (53 Weeks)\n\n\nPre-opening costs decreased due to the timing of new restaurant development. During Fiscal 2016 we opened four restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that are due to open in Fiscal 2017. During Fiscal 2015 we opened seven restaurants and had an additional restaurant under construction at year-end that opened during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nAs a percentage of revenue, total restaurant contribution decreased due to reduced leverage on lower revenue due to lapping the 2014 World Cup.\nWe lease certain restaurant locations, storage spaces, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our restaurant leases generally have initial terms of between 10 and 20 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments. Our leases expire at various dates between 2017 and 2033, excluding extensions at our option. Some of our restaurant leases include renewal options, rent abatements and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Some of our leases also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table.\nFiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2014 contained 52 weeks whereas Fiscal 2015 contained 53 weeks. We estimate the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 contributed approximately $6.8 million of incremental revenue, as compared to Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2014. While certain expenses that were directly related to the incremental revenue increased, other expenses, such as fixed costs, were incurred on a calendar basis.\nGuest counts are measured by the number of entr\u00e9es ordered at our restaurants over a given time period. Examples of our entr\u00e9es include our Full Churrasco Experience, \u00e0 la carte seafood items, and Gaucho Lunch.\nOn June 24, 2015, we completed our initial public offering (\"IPO\") of 5,073,528 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, which included 661,764 shares of common stock sold to the underwriters pursuant to their option to purchase additional shares. After underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering costs, we received net proceeds from the IPO of $91.3 million. Proceeds from the IPO, together with borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our 2012 Credit Facility.\n(dollars in thousands)\n * Not meaningful. \nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized. We test our goodwill annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. We have identified two reporting units, the US and Brazil, based on the geography of the Company's operations to which goodwill is attributable. The impairment evaluation is conducted annually using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess or carrying value over fair value. No impairment to goodwill was recorded during any of the periods presented.\n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \nRestaurant Contribution\nAs a percentage of Brazil restaurant revenue, contribution margin decreased due to a 0.2% increase in food and beverage costs, a 1.1% increase in compensation and benefit costs due to reduced leverage on lower revenue due to lapping the 2014 World Cup, and a 1.5% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses due to reduced leverage on lower revenue due to lapping the 2014 World Cup.\n (g) Consists of cash payments to our regional managers pursuant to retention and non-compete agreements executed in 2012. The final payments under these agreements were paid in October 2015. \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\u201d The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nGeneral and administrative costs are comprised of costs related to certain corporate and administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations. These expenses are generally fixed and reflect management, supervisory and staff salaries, employee benefits and bonuses, share-based compensation, travel expense, information systems, training, corporate rent, technology, market research, and professional and consulting fees, including fees related to the implementation of, and compliance with, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We measure general and administrative costs by tracking general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue.\nPerformance Indicators\nAs a percentage of Brazil restaurant revenue, restaurant contribution margin decreased due to a 2.0% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses due to increased fixed occupancy costs, offset by a 0.6% decrease in food and beverage costs due to waste reduction efforts and a 0.2% decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in share-based compensation expense.\nOur consolidated effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to foreign earnings being subjected to taxation at lower tax rates, FICA tax credits, state income taxes, and nondeductible equity-based compensation.\n \u2022 Grow our restaurant base; \nPre-opening Costs\nAs a result of the IPO, we terminated our Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and paid a one-time non-recurring payment of $7.5 million in connection with the termination during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. While we have benefitted from savings on management fees that we incurred as a private company, these benefits have been offset by the incremental costs we incurred as a public company such as legal, accounting, insurance and other compliance costs.\nRestaurant Contribution\nrestaurants in Brazil as attractive real estate locations become available. We will pursue growth in international markets through a combination of company-owned restaurants and joint ventures, which we believe allows us to expand our brand with limited capital investment by us. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nCompensation and benefit costs increased due to a $9.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expenses and a $0.2 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expenses, offset by a $1.7 million decrease in cumulative share-based compensation expense primarily recognized in conjunction with the IPO in Fiscal 2015, a $1.4 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings as our management teams become more accustomed to predicting, managing and servicing the sales volumes of their new restaurants. The increase is also being driven by investments in third managers as well as increases in minimum wages and group health insurance claims.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d section of this annual report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this annual report and included elsewhere in this annual report. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section and included elsewhere in this annual report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nAs a percentage of US restaurant revenue, restaurant contribution margin decreased due to a 1.7% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses due to increased fixed occupancy costs, and a 0.9% increase in compensation and benefit costs due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings, investments in third managers, and increases in minimum wages and group health insurance claims, offset by a 0.9% decrease in food and beverage costs due to reductions in protein commodity pricing and improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings.\n (c) The table above assumes an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.75% on our Revolving Credit Facility with an annual increase of 25 bps, plus annual administrative agent fees and fees incurred on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. \nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740).\u201d This update requires that entities with a classified balance sheet present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. This update can be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as of July 3, 2016 on a retrospective basis resulting in a reclassification of $2.9 million of current deferred tax assets against non-current deferred tax liabilities of $16.0 million as of January 3, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.\nFood and beverage costs increased primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in food and beverage costs from non-comparable restaurants and a 53rd week impact of $1.8 million, offset by a positive foreign exchange impact of $6.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased, primarily due to initiatives to reduce waste and introduce lower cost seasonal menu offerings.\n * Not meaningful. \n(dollars in thousands)\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nWe operate the majority of our restaurants in leased premises. We record the minimum base rents including option periods which in the judgement of management are reasonably assured of renewal. In determining whether an option period is reasonably assured for renewal we consider the capital outlay required for a location and our target return on that investment. For purposes of calculating straight-line rents, the lease term commences on the date we obtain control of the property, which is normally when the property is ready for normal tenant improvements (build-out period). The difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as a deferred rent liability. Allowances for tenant improvements are included in the deferred rent liability and recognized over the life of the lease by reducing rent expense.\nOur ability to successfully open new restaurants and expand our restaurant base is critical to adding revenue capacity to meet our goals for growth. New restaurant openings contribute additional operating weeks and revenue to our business. Before a new restaurant opens, we incur pre-opening costs, as described below. New restaurants often open with an initial start-up period of sales volatility. Operating margins tend to stabilize within twelve months of opening. New restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher food, labor and other direct operating expenses and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. To achieve our goal to successfully open new restaurants, we consider a number of factors including macro and micro economic conditions, availability of appropriate locations, competition in local markets, and the availability of teams to manage new locations. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nOperating Leases and Deferred Rent\n\nGrowth Strategies and Outlook\nWe experienced lower and stable beef prices in Fiscal 2016, which allowed us to improve food costs as compared to Fiscal 2015. However, in Fiscal 2016 the food-at-home (grocery store or supermarket food items) CPI in the US decreased 1.3% as compared to Fiscal 2015 which marked the first annual decline since 1967.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements, requiring an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs attributable to line-of-credit arrangements after the adoption of ASU 2015-03. In particular, ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of such arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of April 3, 2016. The Company's financial statement presentation was consistent with the guidance in ASU 2015-15. As a result, there was no impact to the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon adoption. Unamortized debt issuance costs as of January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, which are attributable to the Company's 2015 Credit Facility (revolving line-of-credit), are included in other assets (noncurrent) in the consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue. \nTotal revenue increased due to a $20.5 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, the 53rd week impact of $6.8 million and a $1.0 million increase in comparable restaurant revenue, offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of $18.1 million and a $0.7 million decrease in other revenue. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 7.2% due to the 2014 World Cup benefit.\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant expenses and a $2.0 million increase in comparable restaurant expenses, offset by a $0.6 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.3 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased as a result of increased fixed occupancy costs on lower revenue.\nCommodity Pricing\nCertain share-based awards granted from 2012 through 2015 include vesting conditions that require both (i) completion of a four or five-year vesting period and (ii) satisfaction of a Liquidity Event, as defined in the applicable award agreement. Under the terms of those agreements, a Liquidity Event is defined as the earlier to occur of (i) a change in control transaction or (ii) an initial public offering. Upon the closing of the IPO, options for the purchase of 783,606 shares of common stock vested as a result of the satisfaction of the Liquidity Event vesting condition. The Company recognized $5.7 million of compensation expense associated with these options during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\n (b) For Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, excludes $0.03 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of income tax expense attributable to our joint venture in Mexico. \nGuest Counts\nFood and Beverage Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs increased primarily due to a planned increase in advertising spend on digital marketing. As a percentage of total revenue, marketing and advertising costs increased from 2.1% to 2.4%.\nWe experienced significant foreign currency impact during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 due to fluctuations of the Brazilian Real relative to the US dollar. When the US dollar strengthens compared to the Brazilian Real, it has a negative impact on our Brazilian operating results upon translation of those results into US dollars for the purposes of consolidation. We anticipate continued foreign currency volatility throughout Fiscal 2017 with respect to the Brazilian Real. See Supplemental Selected Constant Currency Information\u201d on page 56 for the exchange rate impact on current financial periods.\nGeneral and administrative costs decreased due to the 2015 recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter triggered by the IPO in the amount of $4.3 million, as well as a one-time charge of $7.5 million for the disposition of the Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of THL in connection with the IPO and a $1.2 million decrease in corporate compensation expense. These decreases were offset by a $0.3 million increase in insurance, a $0.3 million increase in corporate travel and a $0.2 million increase in tax consulting expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total general and administrative costs decreased as a result of lapping IPO related expenses from Fiscal 2015.\nOn June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into the 2015 Credit Facility. Upon the closing of the IPO, we drew $165.0 million on the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from the IPO, to repay the outstanding debt under the 2012 Credit Facility.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nIncome tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we operate. Historically we have generated taxable income in the US and Brazil. Our provision includes federal, state and local, and foreign current and deferred income tax expense.\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2015 a series of protests began in Brazil against the Brazilian government and its President. The initial protests occurred in cities throughout Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paolo, and continued throughout the remainder of Fiscal 2015. In March 2016 there were additional anti-government and anti-corruption protests throughout Brazil. During the latter half of Fiscal 2016, the former President of Brazil was impeached and protests occurred in a number of cities in response to government austerity plans. As a result of the protests and political unrest, our restaurants in Brazil experienced reduced guest traffic in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. It is possible that further protests or other social unrest, political activity or political instability may occur in Brazil, which could impact our guest traffic, thereby affecting our revenue and net income. In addition to the uncertain political environment and events discussed above, Brazil continues to suffer from a protracted economic recession that negatively impacts our guests.\n \u2022 Improve margins by leveraging our infrastructure and investments in human capital. \nFogo de Ch\u00e3o (fogo-dee-shoun) is a leading Brazilian steakhouse, or churrascaria, which has specialized for more than 37 years in fire-roasting high-quality meats utilizing the centuries-old Southern Brazilian cooking technique of churrasco. We deliver a distinctive and authentic Brazilian dining experience through the combination of our high-quality Brazilian cuisine and our differentiated service model known as espeto corrido (Portuguese for continuous service\u201d) delivered by our churrasqueiros, which we refer to as our gaucho chefs. We offer our guests a variety of menu choices including our most popular offering the Full Churrasco Experience as well Gaucho Lunch, Weekend Brazilian Brunch and Bar Fogo menu items. The Full Churrasco Experience, our prix fixe menu, provides the opportunity to experience a variety of meats including beef, lamb, pork and chicken, simply seasoned and carefully fire-roasted to expose their natural flavors as well as a selection of fresh seasonal salads and specialty items at the Market Table.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nWe had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, the Company asserted that undistributed net earnings of its Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis as a result of the IPO. Additionally, future US cash projections and the Company's intent to continue investing in restaurants in foreign jurisdictions with cash generated in those jurisdictions drove the decision to make the assertion. Because we consider the undistributed earnings related to our Brazilian subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and are expected to continue to be indefinitely reinvested, no provision for US income and additional foreign taxes is recorded on the aggregate undistributed earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries.\nWe recognize tax liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, and adjust those liabilities when judgments change as a result of evaluation of new information not previously available. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of our tax liabilities. These differences are reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\nLoss on Extinguishment / Modification of Debt\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering which will be June 2020, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nOccupancy and other operating expenses comprise all occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, utility costs, credit card fees, real estate property and other related taxes and other related restaurant supply and occupancy costs, but exclude depreciation and amortization expense, and are measured by tracking occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nIncome Taxes\n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \nWe measure average unit volumes ( AUVs\u201d) on an annual (52-week) basis. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, we exclude the 53rd week from the AUV calculation for consistency purposes. AUVs consist of the average sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. We adjust the sales included in AUV calculations for restaurant closures. This measurement allows us to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base.\n\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nRecently issued accounting standards not included below are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nSegment Reporting\n (f) Consists primarily of payments to an affiliate of THL and advisors engaged by an affiliate of THL for advisory and consulting services. For Fiscal 2015, includes the $7.5 million fee paid to an affiliate of THL as a result of the termination of the advisory services agreement with that affiliate. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nRevenue\nIn this section and other parts of this Form 10-K, we refer to certain measures used for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We also may refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), but have corresponding GAAP-based measures. Where non-GAAP measures appear, we provide tables reconciling these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP-based measures and make reference to a discussion of their use. We believe these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) it does not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) it does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) it does not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income is provided on page 55.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\n (c) For Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, excludes $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of pre-opening costs incurred by our joint venture in Mexico. For Fiscal 2014, excludes $0.2 million of pre-opening costs incurred by our joint venture in Mexico. \nIncome Tax Expense", "item_7_tables": "Table 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>
