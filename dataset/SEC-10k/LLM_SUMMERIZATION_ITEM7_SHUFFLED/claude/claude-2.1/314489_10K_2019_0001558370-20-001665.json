Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 of First Busey and its subsidiaries. It should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business,\u201d Item 6. Selected Financial Data,\u201d the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nDetailed discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operation for 2019 as compared to 2018 can be found below. Comparison of 2018 to 2017 can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nFirst Busey has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of First Busey's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex. These estimates involve judgments, assumptions and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of a materially different financial condition or materially different results of operations is a reasonable likelihood. Further, changes in accounting standards could impact the Company's critical accounting estimates. The following policies could be deemed critical:\nFair Value of Investment Securities. The fair values of investment securities are measurements from an independent pricing service and are based on observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security's terms and conditions, among other things. The use of different judgments and estimates to determine the fair value of securities could result in a different fair value estimate.\nRealized securities gains or losses are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Declines in the fair value of debt securities below their amortized cost are evaluated to determine whether such declines are temporary or OTTI. If the Company (i) has the intent to sell a debt security or (ii) will more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, then the Company recognizes the entire decline in fair value as an OTTI loss. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company evaluates whether a credit loss exists. The decline in fair value is separated into the amount of impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the impairment related to credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount of impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Fair values are determined based on the definition of fair value\u201d defined in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\u201d\nThe fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination generally requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than other assets acquired or liabilities assumed. At the date of acquisition, when loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. At each future reporting date, the\nCompany re-estimates the expected cash flows of the loans. Subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in the expected cash flows will generally be offset against the allowance for loan losses to the extent an allowance has been established or will be recognized as interest income prospectively.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. Determining the fair value often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Goodwill is not amortized, instead, the Company assess the potential for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.\nIncome Taxes. The Company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to federal and state tax jurisdictions. Estimated income tax expense is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accrued and deferred taxes, as reported in other assets or other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or in the future. Management judgment is involved in estimating accrued and deferred taxes, as it may be necessary to evaluate the risks and merits of the tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, and taxable income calculations after considering tax-related statutes, regulations and other relevant factors. Because of the complexity of tax laws and interpretations, interpretation is subject to judgment.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. First Busey has established an allowance for loan losses which represents its estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and reduces the total loans outstanding by an estimate of uncollectible loans. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged against and reduce the allowance. A provision for loan losses is charged to current expense and acts to replenish the allowance for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at a level that management deems adequate. Acquired loans from business combinations with uncollected principal balances are carried net of a fair value adjustment for credit and interest rates. These loans are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the fair value adjustment. However, as the acquired loans renew, it is generally necessary to establish an allowance which represents an amount that, in management's opinion, will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses in such loans.\nTo determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, a formal analysis is completed quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio. This assessment is reviewed by the Company's senior management. The analysis includes a review of historical performance, dollar amount and trends of past due loans, dollar amount and trends in non-performing loans, certain impaired loans, and loans identified as sensitive assets. Sensitive assets include non-accrual loans, past-due loans, loans on First Busey's watch loan reports and other loans identified as having probable potential for loss.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component considers loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when either the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying amount of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and classified loans not considered impaired and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss experience.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable First Busey will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan becomes impaired, management generally calculates the impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral-dependent or based on the discounted cash flows of the loan at the loan's effective interest rate. The amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded through a charge to the provision for loan losses. For collateral dependent loans, the allowance is based upon the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the applicable collateral. The required allowance or actual loss on an impaired loan could differ significantly if the ultimate fair value of the collateral is significantly different from the fair value estimate.\nExecutive Summary\nOperating Results (dollars in thousands)\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income by operating segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Banking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 106,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 97,369\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remittance Processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,710\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wealth Management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,372\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,651)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,523)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 102,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 98,928\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Performance\nNet income for the full year 2019 was $103.0 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $98.9 million, or $2.01 per diluted common share, for the full year 2018. Adjusted net income(1) for the full year 2019 was $118.4 million, or $2.15 per diluted common share, compared to $103.5 million or $2.10 per diluted common share for the full year 2018.\nThe Company views certain non-operating items, including acquisition-related and restructuring charges, as adjustments to net income reported under GAAP. Non-operating pretax adjustments for 2019 were $14.7 million of expenses related to acquisitions and $5.4 million of expenses related to other restructuring costs. The reconciliation of non-GAAP measures (including adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted net interest margin, adjusted efficiency ratio, tangible book value, tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity), which the Company believes facilitates the assessment of its financial results and peer comparability, is included in tabular form in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Non-GAAP Financial Information.\nOn January 31, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Banc Ed, the holding company for TheBANK. First Busey operated TheBANK as a separate subsidiary from the completion of the acquisition until October 4, 2019, when it was merged with and into Busey Bank. When we completed the Banc Ed acquisition, we reset the baseline for the future financial performance of First Busey. With TheBANK now merged and integrated, we expect to see the full contribution and synergies of TheBANK reflected in the Company's financial performance in the years ahead.\nOn August 31, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of IST, a Fort Myers, Florida wealth management firm. Through this transaction, Busey Bank and IST broaden the expertise and raise the level of service available to their clients-from individuals and families to institutions and foundations-and remain committed to their founding principles of being active community stewards and providing the highest level of personal service to clients delivered by experienced, local professionals.\nOn October 4, 2019, in addition to the merger of TheBANK into Busey Bank, the Company partnered with a new core operating system provider. The core conversion positions the combined organization for future growth and will allow the Company to serve customers more efficiently and effectively for years to come.\nRevenues from trust fees, commissions and brokers' fees, and remittance processing activities represented 46.0% of the Company's non-interest income in 2019, providing a balance to spread-based revenue from traditional banking activities. Further, non-interest income, excluding net security losses, represented 28.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>For a reconciliation of adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure, see Non-GAAP Financial Information. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Quality\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company reported non-performing loans of $29.5 million compared to $36.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans were 0.44% of total portfolio loans as of December 31, 2019 compared to 0.66% as of December 31, 2018. While these results are encouraging, asset quality metrics can be generally influenced by market-specific economic conditions, and specific measures may fluctuate from period to period.

Interest rate levels and volume fluctuations within earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income. Net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets.\nCertain assets with tax favorable treatment are evaluated on a tax-equivalent basis. Tax-equivalent basis assumes an income tax rate of 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017. Tax favorable assets generally have lower contractual pre-tax yields than fully taxable assets. A tax-equivalent analysis is performed by adding the tax savings to the earnings on tax favorable assets. After factoring in the tax favorable effects of these assets, the yields may be more appropriately evaluated against alternative earning assets. In addition to yield, various other risks are factored into the evaluation process.\nThe following tables (dollars in thousands) show our Consolidated Average Balance Sheets, detailing the major categories of assets and liabilities, the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, the interest expense paid for the interest-bearing liabilities, and the related interest rates for the periods shown. The tables also show, for the periods indicated, a summary of the changes in interest earned and interest expense resulting from changes in volume and rates for the major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on changes due to rate and changes due to volume.

Funds, and Net Interest Margin\nThe Consolidated Average Balance Sheets and interest rates were impacted by the 2019 acquisitions of Banc Ed, along with organic growth. Total average interest-earning assets increased $1.5 billion, or 21.5%, to $8.6 billion in 2019, as compared to $7.1 billion in 2018. Average loans increased and generally have notably higher yields compared to interest-bearing bank deposits and investment securities, so the loan growth contributed to a positive effect on net interest margin.\nTotal average interest-bearing liability balances increased $1.2 billion, or 22.3%, to $6.4 billion in 2019 as compared to $5.2 billion in 2018. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $254.7 million, or 17.1%, to $1.7 billion in 2019, as compared to $1.5 billion in 2018. Average non-interest bearing deposits represented 22.8% of total average deposits in 2019. The Company remains strongly core deposit funded with total average deposits in 2019 representing 92.9% of total average liabilities, with solid liquidity and significant market share in the communities we serve.\nInterest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $71.0 million, or 24.6%, to $359.2 million in 2019, from $288.3 million in 2018. The interest income increase related primarily to increases in loan volumes. Interest expense increased during 2019 by $24.4 million to $69.0 million from $44.6 million in 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily the result of higher funding costs combined with an increase in deposits and borrowings balances.\nNet interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $46.6 million, or 19.1%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The Federal Open Market Committee lowered Federal Funds Target Rates for the first time in 11 years on July 31, 2019 and then again on September 18, 2019 and October 30, 2019, for a combined decrease of 75 basis points during 2019. This contributed to the decline in net interest margin during the second half of 2019 as assets, in particular commercial loans, repriced more quickly and to a greater extent than liabilities.\nNet interest margin, our net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets stated on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.38% in 2019, which included a tax-equivalent adjustment of $3.0 million, compared to 3.45% in 2018, which included a tax-equivalent adjustment of $2.3 million.\nThe net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.10% in 2019 compared to 3.23% in 2018, each on a tax-equivalent basis.\nThe quarterly net interest margins were as

The 2019 increases reflect organic growth as well as the 2019 acquisitions of Banc Ed and IST.\nWealth management fees increased to $38.6 million, or 24.5%, in 2019 compared to $31.0 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, assets under care were approximately $9.7 billion compared to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2018. At the time of acquisition, Banc Ed added $1.5 billion in assets under care and IST added $0.5 million in assets under care, with the balance of year over year growth being organic.\nFees for customer services were impacted by acquisition activity and increased to $36.7 million in 2019 as compared to $28.9 million in 2018. Evolving regulation, product changes and changing behaviors by our client base may impact the revenue derived from charges on deposit accounts in the future.\nRemittance processing revenue relates to our payment processing company, FirsTech. Remittance processing revenue of $15.0 million in 2019 increased compared to $14.3 million in 2018. Remittance processing adds important diversity to our revenue stream while widening our array of service offerings to larger commercial clients within our footprint and nationally.\nMortgage revenue of $11.7 million in 2019 increased $6.2 million compared to $5.5 million in 2018, following a long period of restructuring and as a result of additional revenue from TheBANK. A decline in prevailing market rates for mortgages also contributed to increased production in recent periods.\nIncome on bank owned life insurance increased $2.1 million, or 55.5%, in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of the Banc Ed acquisition and life insurance proceeds.\nOther income of $8.6 million in 2019 increased as compared to $6.2 million in 2018 across multiple revenue sources,

compared to $193.0 million in 2018. Total non-interest expenses have been influenced by acquisition expenses and other restructuring costs. The Company remains focused on expense discipline and expects additional expense savings from the integration of prior acquisitions and recent core operating system conversion efforts to be realized over the next year.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits were $140.5 million in 2019 compared to $107.8 million for the same period of 2018. Total full time equivalents at December 31, 2019 was 1,531 compared to 1,270 at December 31, 2018.\nData processing expense in 2019 increased to $21.5 million compared to $16.4 million for the same period of 2018. Data processing included $2.4 million of non-operating expenses, related to the payment of merger and conversion expenses. Data processing for 2019 also includes data processing related to TheBANK from January 31, 2019 until merged with Busey Bank on October 4, 2019.\nCombined net occupancy expense of premises and furniture and equipment expenses of $27.7 million in 2019 increased as compared to $22.0 million in 2018. The increase was largely due to acquisitions, which in 2019 resulted in 20 additional facilities. We continue to evaluate our banking center network. The Company opened four banking centers and closed six banking centers in 2019.\nProfessional fees of $11.1 million in 2019 increased by $5.7 million as compared to $5.4 million in 2018. Professional fees were influenced by acquisition expenses and other restructuring costs as well as Company initiatives.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $9.5 million in 2019 as compared to $5.9 million in 2018 as a result of increases in intangible asset balances from acquisitions.\nOther expense of $48.5 million in 2019 increased as compared to $35.5 million in 2018. Variances are across multiple expense categories, including business development and marketing expenses, branch impairment and acquisition-related check card service expense.\nThe efficiency ratio(3) is calculated as total non-interest expense, less amortization charges, as a percentage of tax-equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income, less security gains and losses. The efficiency ratio, which is a measure commonly used by management and the banking industry, measures the amount of expense incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio was 61.3% in 2019 as compared to 56.2% in 2018. Operating costs have been influenced by acquisition expenses and other restructuring costs and the adjusted efficiency ratio(3) was 56.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. While acquisition expenses may have a negative impact on the efficiency ratios, the Company expects to realize operating efficiencies creating a positive impact in future years.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>(3) </td> <td>For a reconciliation of efficiency ratio and adjusted efficiency ratio, non-GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Financial Information. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate, or income taxes divided by income before taxes, was 23.4% and 26.1% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any non-U.S. Treasury securities or obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies issued securities that exceeded 10% of the Company's total stockholders' equity.\nPortfolio Loans\nThe Company believes that making sound and profitable loans is a necessary and desirable means of employing funds available for investment. The Company maintains lending policies and procedures designed to focus lending efforts on the types, locations and duration of loans most appropriate for its business model and markets. While not specifically limited, the Company attempts to focus its lending on short to intermediate-term (0-7 years) loans in geographic areas within 125 miles of its lending offices. Loans originated outside of these areas are generally residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market or loans to existing customers of the bank. The Company attempts to utilize government-assisted lending programs, such as the Small Business Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture lending programs, when prudent. Generally, loans are collateralized by assets, primarily real estate and guaranteed by individuals. The loans are expected to be repaid primarily from cash flows of the borrowers or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers.\nManagement reviews and approves the Company's lending policies and procedures on a regular basis. Management routinely (at least quarterly) reviews the Company's allowance for loan losses in conjunction with reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing and potential problem loans. The Company's underwriting standards are designed to encourage relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Relationship banking implies a primary banking relationship with the borrower that includes, at a minimum, an active deposit banking relationship in addition to the lending relationship. Significant underwriting factors in addition to location, duration, a sound and profitable cash flow basis and the borrower's character include the quality of the borrower's financial history, the liquidity of the underlying collateral and the reliability of the valuation of the underlying collateral.\nAt no time is a borrower's total borrowing relationship permitted to exceed the Company's regulatory lending limit. The Company generally limits such relationships to amounts substantially less than the regulatory limit. Loans to related parties, including executive officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries, are reviewed for compliance with regulatory guidelines by the Company's board of directors at least annually.\nThe Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews the loans for compliance with the Company's loan policy on a periodic basis. In addition, the loan review department reviews the risk assessments made by the Company's credit department, lenders and loan committees. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit committee at least quarterly.\nThe Company's lending can be summarized into five primary areas: commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, real estate construction loans, retail real estate loans, and retail other loans.\nCommercial Loans\nCommercial loans typically comprise working capital loans or business expansion loans, including loans for asset purchases and other business loans. Commercial loans will generally be guaranteed in full or a significant amount by the primary owners of the business. Commercial loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the underlying borrower and secondarily on the underlying assets pledged as collateral by the borrower. The cash flows of the underlying borrower, however, may not perform consistently with historical or projected information. Further, the collateral securing loans may fluctuate in value due to individual economic or other factors. The Company has established minimum standards and underwriting guidelines for all commercial loan types.\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\nThe commercial environment, along with the academic presence in some of the Company's markets, provides for the majority of the Company's commercial lending opportunities to be commercial real estate related, including multi-unit housing. As the majority of the Company's loan portfolio is within the commercial real estate class, the Company's goal is to maintain a high quality, geographically diverse portfolio of commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and guidelines similar to commercial loans. Commercial real estate loans will generally be guaranteed in full or a significant amount by the primary owners of the business. The repayment of\nthese loans is primarily dependent on the cash flows of the underlying property. However, commercial real estate loans generally must be supported by an adequate underlying collateral value. The performance and the value of the underlying property may be adversely affected by economic factors or geographical and/or industry specific factors. These loans are subject to other industry guidelines that are closely monitored by the Company.\nReal Estate Construction Loans\nReal estate construction loans are typically commercial in nature. The loan proceeds are monitored by the Company and advanced for the improvement of real estate in which the Company holds a mortgage. Real estate construction loans will generally be guaranteed in full or a significant amount by the developer or primary owners of the business. These loans are subject to underwriting standards and guidelines similar to commercial loans. The loan generally must be supported by an adequate as completed\u201d value of the underlying project. In addition to the underlying project, the financial history of the developer and business owners weighs significantly in determining approval. The repayment of these loans is typically through permanent financing following completion of the construction. Real estate construction loans are inherently more risky than loans on completed properties as the unimproved nature and the financial risks of construction significantly enhance the risks of commercial real estate loans. These loans are closely monitored and subject to other industry guidelines.\nRetail Real Estate Loans\nRetail real estate loans are comprised of direct consumer loans that include residential real estate, residential real estate construction loans, home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. In 2019, the Company sold the majority of its originated fixed rate retail real estate loans to secondary market purchasers. As retail real estate loan underwriting is subject to specific regulations, the Company typically underwrites its retail real estate loans to conform to widely accepted standards. Several factors are considered in underwriting including the value of the underlying real estate and the debt to income and credit history of the borrower.\nRetail Other Loans\nRetail other loans consist of installment loans to individuals, including automotive loans. These loans are centrally underwritten utilizing the borrower's financial history, including the FICO credit scoring and information as to the underlying collateral. Repayment is expected from the cash flow of the borrower.\nThe composition of our portfolio loans as of the dates indicated was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 68: <table><tr><td>\n</td>

to be appropriate based upon the information available. However, additional losses may be identified in our loan portfolio as new information is obtained.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is a current charge against income and represents an amount which management believes is sufficient to maintain an appropriate allowance for probable losses in the loan portfolio. In assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, management considers the size and quality of the loan portfolio measured against prevailing economic conditions, regulatory guidelines, historical loan loss experience and credit quality of the portfolio. When a determination is made by management to charge-off a loan balance, a write-off is charged against the allowance for loan losses. We continue to attempt to identify problem loan situations on a proactive basis. Once problem loans are identified, adjustments to the provision for loan losses are made based upon all information available at that time.\nThe provision for loan losses was $10.4 million in 2019, $4.4 million in 2018 and $5.3 million in 2017. As a result of acquisitions, the Company is holding acquired loans that are carried net of a fair value adjustment for credit and interest rate marks and are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the fair value adjustment. However, as the acquired loans renew and as the Company originates new loan production, it is necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses, which represents an amount that, in management's opinion, will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses.\nSensitive assets include non-accrual loans, loans on our classified loan reports and other loans identified as having more than reasonable potential for loss. Management reviews sensitive assets on at least a quarterly basis for changes in each applicable customer's ability to pay and changes in valuation of underlying collateral in order to estimate probable losses. The majority of these loans are being repaid in conformance with their contracts.\nNon-performing Loans\nLoans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management's opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory guidelines. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nTypically, loans are secured by collateral. When a loan is classified as non-accrual and determined to be collateral dependent, it is appropriately reserved or charged down through the allowance for loan losses to the fair value of our interest in the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. Our loan portfolio is collateralized primarily by real estate.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning non-performing loans and performing restructured loans at December 31 for each of the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 27,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 34,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 24,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 21,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 12,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans 90+ days past due and still accruing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 783\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-performing assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 32,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 36,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 28,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 24,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performing restructured loans not included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 9,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 10,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to portfolio loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 182.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 195.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 221.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 372.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing loans to portfolio loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing assets to portfolio loans and\nOREO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-performing loans and OREO were $32.6 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $37.0 million at December 31, 2018. Asset quality metrics remain dependent upon market-specific economic conditions, and specific measures may fluctuate from period to period.\nPotential Problem Loans\nPotential problem loans are those loans which are not categorized as impaired, restructured, non-accrual or 90+ days past due, but where current information indicates that the borrower may not be able to comply with loan repayment terms. Management assesses the potential for loss on such loans and considers the effect of any potential loss in determining its provision for probable loan losses. Potential problem loans totaled $74.6 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $70.9 million at December 31, 2018. Management continues to monitor these credits and anticipates that restructurings, guarantees, additional collateral or other planned actions will result in full repayment of the debts. As of December 31, 2019, management identified no other loans that represent or result from trends or uncertainties which would be expected to materially impact future operating results, liquidity or capital resources.\nDeposits\nThe following table shows the deposit mix as of the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Demand deposits, noninterest- bearing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,832,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,464,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,597,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing transaction deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,989,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,435,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,166,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Saving deposits and money market deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,545,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,852,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,026,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,534,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,497,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,336,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,902,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,249,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,125,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe focus on deepening our relationship with customers to foster core deposit growth, allowing us to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. As a result of this and the Banc Ed acquisition, non-maturity deposits increased by $1.6 billion, or 34.0%, to $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. Excluding deposits acquired in the Banc Ed acquisition, non-maturity deposits increased $379.1 million. Additionally, brokered deposits were $18.0 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $280.0 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of 93.6% from prior year. Time deposits as a percentage of total deposits decreased to 19.4% as of December 31, 2019 compared to 24.0% as of December 31, 2018. As time deposits mature, the Company is actively engaging our customers to renew at current market rates.\nBorrowings\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured borrowings, generally mature daily. Short-term borrowings include FHLB advances which mature in less than one year from date of origination.\nOn January 29, 2019, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement providing for a $60.0 million term loan (the Term Loan\u201d) with a maturity date of November 30, 2023. The Term Loan has an annual interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.50%. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to fund the cash consideration related to the acquisition of Banc Ed. The Company had $54.0 million outstanding indebtedness on December 31, 2019, comprised of $6.0 million of short-term borrowings and $48.0 million of long-term debt. The Term Loan is redeemable by the Company at its option at any time prior to maturity.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also retained the Company's $20.0 million revolving facility with a maturity date of April 30, 2019. On April 19, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity of its revolving loan facility to April 30, 2020. The revolving facility incurs a non-usage fee based on the undrawn amount. The Company had no outstanding balance under the revolving facility on December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of short-term borrowings and weighted average interest rates thereon (dollars in thousands):\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ending December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 205,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 185,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 304,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum outstanding at any month end in year-to-date period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 225,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 267,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 304,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily balance for the year-to-date period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 196,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 234,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 213,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate during period(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings, FHLB advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 220,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum outstanding at any month end in year-to-date period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 99,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 225,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 234,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily balance for the year-to-date period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 27,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 81,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 84,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate during period(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>The weighted average interest rate is computed by dividing total interest for the period by the average daily balance outstanding. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the Term Loan, long-term debt includes funds borrowed from the FHLB which totaled $35.6 million and $50.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOn May 25, 2017, the Company issued $40.0 million of 3.75% senior notes that mature on May 25, 2022. The senior notes are payable semi-annually on each May 25 and November 25, commencing on November 25, 2017. The senior notes are not subject to optional redemption by the Company. Additionally, on May 25, 2017, the Company issued $60.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes that mature on May 25, 2027. The subordinated notes, which qualify as Tier 2 capital for First Busey, bear interest at an annual rate of 4.75% for the first five years after issuance and thereafter bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.919%, as calculated on each applicable determination date. The subordinated notes are payable semi-annually on each May 25 and November 25, commencing on November 25, 2017 during the five year fixed-term and thereafter on February 25, May 25, August 25 and November 25 of each year, commencing on August 25, 2022. The subordinated notes have an optional redemption in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after May 25, 2022. The senior notes and subordinated notes are unsecured obligations of the Company. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes and subordinated\nnotes totaled $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes and subordinated notes totaled $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018.\nIn connection with the First Community acquisition, the Company assumed $15.3 million in subordinated debt, of which $9.8 million was simultaneously redeemed. A $0.3 million purchase accounting premium was recorded on the remaining balance of the subordinated debt. On September 30, 2018, the Company, at its option, redeemed the balance of the subordinated debt at a redemption price equal to the principal amount outstanding plus accrued but unpaid interest.\nJunior Subordinated Debt Owed to Unconsolidated Trusts\nFirst Busey maintains statutory trusts for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing trust preferred securities and related trust common securities. The proceeds from such issuances were used by the trusts to purchase junior subordinated notes of the Company, which are the sole assets of each trust. Concurrent with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, the Company issued guarantees for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities are instruments that qualify, and are treated by the Company, as Tier 1 regulatory capital. The Company owns all of the common securities of each trust. The trust preferred securities issued by each trust rank equally with the common securities in right of payment, except that if an event of default under the indenture governing the notes has occurred and is continuing, the preferred securities will rank senior to the common securities in right of payment. In connection with the Pulaski acquisition in 2016, the Company acquired similar statutory trusts maintained by Pulaski and the fair value adjustment is being accreted over the weighted average remaining life. The Company had $71.3 million and $71.2 million of junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated trusts at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management is the process by which we ensure that adequate liquid funds are available to meet the present and future cash flow obligations arising in the daily operations of our business. These financial obligations consist of needs for funds to meet commitments to borrowers for extensions of credit, fund capital expenditures, honor withdrawals by customers, pay dividends to stockholders and pay operating expenses. Our most liquid assets are cash and due from banks, interest-bearing bank deposits and federal funds sold. The balances of these assets are dependent on the Company's operating, investing, lending, and financing activities during any given period.\nAverage liquid assets are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and due from banks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 114,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 105,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 92,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing bank deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 312,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal funds sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 427,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 239,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 224,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of average total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFirst Busey's primary sources of funds consist of deposits, investment maturities and sales, loan principal repayments, and capital funds. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve, First Busey's revolving loan facility, or to utilize brokered deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2019, management believed that adequate liquidity existed to meet all projected cash flow obligations. We seek to achieve a satisfactory degree of liquidity by actively managing both assets and liabilities. Asset management guides the proportion of liquid assets to total assets, while liability management monitors future funding requirements and prices liabilities accordingly.\nThe ability of the Company to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to service its debt is dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its subsidiaries. Under applicable regulatory requirements, an Illinois state-chartered bank such as Busey Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. Because Busey Bank had been in an accumulated deficit position from 2009 thru 2018, it was not able to pay dividends in prior years. With prior approval from its regulators,\nhowever, an Illinois state-chartered bank in that situation was able to reduce its capital stock by amending its charter to decrease the authorized number of shares, and then make a subsequent distribution to its holding company. Using this approach, and with the approval of its regulators, Busey Bank has distributed funds to the Company, most recently in the amount of $40.0 million on October 12, 2018. Busey Bank returned to a positive retained earnings position in the second quarter of 2018 and, in 2019, returned to paying dividends.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nThe Bank routinely enters into commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding loan commitments and standby letters of credit of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The balance of commitments to extend credit represents future cash requirements and some of these commitments may expire without being drawn upon. We anticipate we will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments, including loan applications received and in process prior to the issuance of firm commitments.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments which generally relate to funding of operations through deposits, debt issuance, and property and equipment leases.\nThe following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Junior\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Subordinated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Owed to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Subordinated Notes,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Certificates of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unconsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Long-term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>net of unamortized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Trusts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,012,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,014,703\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 283,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 303,465\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 168,645\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,741\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,369\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 133,443\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,534,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 10,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 71,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 83,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 98,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,799,366\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to extend credit\nand standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,692,146\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $80.8 million in 2019 compared to $202.5 million in 2018. Significant items affecting the cash flows provided by operating activities include net income, depreciation, amortization expenses, the provision for loan losses, deferred income taxes, gain on sales of mortgage loans, net of origination costs and activities related to the origination and sales of loans held for sale. Net cash used to originate loans held for sale totaled $25.7 million in 2019 compared to $79.4 million of net cash provided by loan sales in 2018. Fluctuations in sales are a function of changes in market rates for mortgage loans, which influence refinance activity.\nNet cash provided by investing activities totaled $65.0 million in 2019 compared to $55.4 million used in investing activities in 2018. Significant items affecting cash flows from investing activities are those activities associated with managing the Company's investment and loan portfolios and cash received/paid in acquisitions. The Company experienced a net increase in loans of $244.3 million in 2019 compared to $49.9 million in 2018, excluding acquired loans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $143.6 million in 2019 compared to $260.5 million used in financing activities in 2018. Significant items affecting cash flows from financing activities are debt issuance, deposits, short-term\nborrowings, long-term debt, payment of dividends and proceeds and redemption from stock issuances. Deposits, which represent the Company's primary funding source, increased by $215.6 million in 2019 compared to an increase of $123.6 million in 2018, excluding acquired deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $30.9 million in 2019 compared to $118.8 million in 2018.\nCapital Resources\nCapital Purchase Program Warrant\nIn connection with the Company's participation in the Capital Purchase Program, the Company issued to Treasury a warrant to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. At December 31, 2019, this warrant to purchase 191,278 shares of the Company's common stock, at an exercise price of $39.21, remained outstanding.\nRegulatory Capital\nThe ability of the Company to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to service its debt is dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its subsidiaries. Under applicable regulatory requirements, an Illinois state-chartered bank such as Busey Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. Because Busey Bank had been in an accumulated deficit position from 2009 thru 2018, it was not able to pay dividends in prior years. With prior approval from its regulators, however, an Illinois state-chartered bank in that situation was able to reduce its capital stock by amending its charter to decrease the authorized number of shares, and then make a subsequent distribution to its holding company. Using this approach, and with the approval of its regulators, Busey Bank has distributed funds to the Company, most recently in the amount of $40.0 million on October 12, 2018. Busey Bank returned to a positive retained earnings position in the second quarter of 2018 and, in 2019, returned to paying dividends.\nOur capital ratios are in excess of those required to be considered well-capitalized\u201d pursuant to applicable regulatory guidelines. The Federal Reserve Board uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks. Risk-based capital ratios are established by allocating assets and certain off-balance-sheet commitments into risk-weighted categories. These balances are then multiplied by the factor appropriate for that risk-weighted category. In order to refrain from restrictions on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments, banking institutions must maintain minimum ratios of (i) Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. As of December 31, 2019, First Busey had a total capital to total risk-weighted asset ratio of 14.03%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 12.49%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 11.49% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.88%; Busey Bank had ratios of 14.92%, 14.19%, 14.19% and 11.19%, respectively. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since December 31, 2019 that would materially adversely change the Company's or Busey Bank's capital classifications.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Information relating to accounting pronouncements issued and applicable to the Company in 2019 appears in Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe effect of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from the effect on an industrial company. While a financial institution's operating expenses, particularly salaries, wages and employee benefits, are affected by general inflation, the asset and liability structure of a financial institution consists largely of monetary items. Monetary items, such as cash, loans and deposits, are those assets and liabilities which are or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than does general inflation. For additional information regarding interest rates and changes in net interest income see Results of Operations - Average Balance Sheets and Interest Rates and", "item_7_truncated": "On October 4, 2019, in addition to the merger of TheBANK into Busey Bank, the Company partnered with a new core operating system provider. The core conversion positions the combined organization for future growth and will allow the Company to serve customers more efficiently and effectively for years to come.\nNon-performing Loans\n\nThe provision for loan losses was $10.4 million in 2019, $4.4 million in 2018 and $5.3 million in 2017. As a result of acquisitions, the Company is holding acquired loans that are carried net of a fair value adjustment for credit and interest rate marks and are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the fair value adjustment. However, as the acquired loans renew and as the Company originates new loan production, it is necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses, which represents an amount that, in management's opinion, will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,748,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,405,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,414,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 959,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 656,576\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,793,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,366,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,354,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,654,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,208,429\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 401,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 288,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 261,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 182,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96,568\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,693,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,480,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,460,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,069,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 651,191\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,975\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,687,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,568,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,519,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,878,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,627,739\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPortfolio loans increased $1.1 billion, or 20.1%, as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 as a result of the Banc Ed acquisition and organic growth.

In assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, management considers the size and quality of the loan portfolio measured against prevailing economic conditions, regulatory guidelines, historical loan loss experience and credit quality of the portfolio. When a determination is made by management to charge-off a loan balance, a write-off is charged against the allowance for loan losses. We continue to attempt to identify problem loan situations on a proactive basis. Once problem loans are identified, adjustments to the provision for loan losses are made based upon all information available at that time.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligations of states and political subdivisions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 33,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 41,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 511,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 339,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of securities held to maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 603,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 441,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortized cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 608,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 443,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value as a percentage of amortized cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99.44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effect of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from the effect on an industrial company.

regulatory guidelines. The Federal Reserve Board uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks. Risk-based capital ratios are established by allocating assets and certain off-balance-sheet commitments into risk-weighted categories. These balances are then multiplied by the factor appropriate for that risk-weighted category. In order to refrain from restrictions on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments, banking institutions must maintain minimum ratios of (i) Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. As of December 31, 2019, First Busey had a total capital to total risk-weighted asset ratio of 14.03%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 12.49%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 11.49% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.88%; Busey Bank had ratios of 14.92%, 14.19%, 14.19% and 11.19%, respectively. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since December 31, 2019 that would materially adversely change the Company's or Busey Bank's capital classifications.\nTable 62:

past due, but where current information indicates that the borrower may not be able to comply with loan repayment terms. Management assesses the potential for loss on such loans and considers the effect of any potential loss in determining its provision for probable loan losses. Potential problem loans totaled $74.6 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $70.9 million at December 31, 2018. Management continues to monitor these credits and anticipates that restructurings, guarantees, additional collateral or other planned actions will result in full repayment of the debts. As of December 31, 2019, management identified no other loans that represent or result from trends or uncertainties which would be expected to materially impact future operating results, liquidity or capital resources.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Junior\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Subordinated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Owed to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Subordinated Notes,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Certificates of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unconsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Long-term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>net of unamortized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Trusts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,012,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,014,703\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 283,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 303,465\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 168,645\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,741\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,369\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 133,443\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,534,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 10,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 71,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 83,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 98,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,799,366\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to extend credit\nand standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,692,146\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables (dollars in thousands) show our Consolidated Average Balance Sheets, detailing the major categories of assets and liabilities, the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, the interest expense paid for the interest-bearing liabilities, and the related interest rates for the periods shown.

The efficiency ratio, which is a measure commonly used by management and the banking industry, measures the amount of expense incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio was 61.3% in 2019 as compared to 56.2% in 2018. Operating costs have been influenced by acquisition expenses and other restructuring costs and the adjusted efficiency ratio(3) was 56.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. While acquisition expenses may have a negative impact on the efficiency ratios, the Company expects to realize operating efficiencies creating a positive impact in future years.\n\nTable 60:

Using this approach, and with the approval of its regulators, Busey Bank has distributed funds to the Company, most recently in the amount of $40.0 million on October 12, 2018. Busey Bank returned to a positive retained earnings position in the second quarter of 2018 and, in 2019, returned to paying dividends.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also retained the Company's $20.0 million revolving facility with a maturity date of April 30, 2019. On April 19, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity of its revolving loan facility to April 30, 2020.

As a result of acquisitions, the Company is holding $1.7 billion of acquired loans that are carried net of a fair value adjustment of $20.2 million for credit and interest rate marks and are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the fair value adjustment.\nRetail other loans consist of installment loans to individuals, including automotive loans. These loans are centrally underwritten utilizing the borrower's financial history, including the FICO credit scoring and information as to the underlying collateral. Repayment is expected from the cash flow of the borrower.\n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $80.8 million in 2019 compared to $202.5 million in 2018. Significant items affecting the cash flows provided by operating activities include net income, depreciation, amortization expenses, the provision for loan losses, deferred income taxes, gain on sales of mortgage loans, net of origination costs and activities related to the origination and sales of loans held for sale. Net cash used to originate loans held for sale totaled $25.7 million in 2019 compared to $79.4 million of net cash provided by loan sales in 2018. Fluctuations in sales are a function of changes in market rates for mortgage loans, which influence refinance activity.\nRegulatory Capital\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe maturities, fair values and weighted average yields of debt securities available for sale as of December 31, 2019 were (dollars in thousands):\nTotal non-interest income of $116.4 million increased $26.4 million from $90.0 million in 2018. The 2019 increases reflect organic growth as well as the 2019 acquisitions of Banc Ed and IST.\nEffects of Inflation\nTo determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, a formal analysis is completed quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio. This assessment is reviewed by the Company's senior management. The analysis includes a review of historical performance, dollar amount and trends of past due loans, dollar amount and trends in non-performing loans, certain impaired loans, and loans identified as sensitive assets. Sensitive assets include non-accrual loans, past-due loans, loans on First Busey's watch loan reports and other loans identified as having probable potential for loss.\nThe Bank routinely enters into commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding loan commitments and standby letters of credit of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The balance of commitments to extend credit represents future cash requirements and some of these commitments may expire without being drawn upon. We anticipate we will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments, including loan applications received and in process prior to the issuance of firm commitments.\nThe Consolidated Average Balance Sheets and interest rates were impacted by the 2019 acquisitions of Banc Ed, along with organic growth. Total average interest-earning assets increased $1.5 billion, or 21.5%, to $8.6 billion in 2019, as compared to $7.1 billion in 2018. Average loans increased and generally have notably higher yields compared to interest-bearing bank deposits and investment securities, so the loan growth contributed to a positive effect on net interest margin.\n\nPotential Problem Loans\nNet income for the full year 2019 was $103.0 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $98.9 million, or $2.01 per diluted common share, for the full year 2018. Adjusted net income(1) for the full year 2019 was $118.4 million, or $2.15 per diluted common share, compared to $103.5 million or $2.10 per diluted common share for the full year 2018.\nNon-interest Income (dollars in thousands)\nAs of December 31, 2019, management believed that adequate liquidity existed to meet all projected cash flow obligations. We seek to achieve a satisfactory degree of liquidity by actively managing both assets and liabilities. Asset management guides the proportion of liquid assets to total assets, while liability management monitors future funding requirements and prices liabilities accordingly.\n (1) The weighted average interest rate is computed by dividing total interest for the period by the average daily balance outstanding. \nAverage Balance Sheets and Interest Rates\n (3) For a reconciliation of efficiency ratio and adjusted efficiency ratio, non-GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Financial Information. \nGeographic distributions of portfolio loans, based on origination, by category were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nIncome on bank owned life insurance increased $2.1 million, or 55.5%, in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of the Banc Ed acquisition and life insurance proceeds.\n\nIncome Taxes. The Company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to federal and state tax jurisdictions. Estimated income tax expense is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accrued and deferred taxes, as reported in other assets or other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or in the future. Management judgment is involved in estimating accrued and deferred taxes, as it may be necessary to evaluate the risks and merits of the tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, and taxable income calculations after considering tax-related statutes, regulations and other relevant factors. Because of the complexity of tax laws and interpretations, interpretation is subject to judgment.\nCapital Resources\nThe Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews the loans for compliance with the Company's loan policy on a periodic basis. In addition, the loan review department reviews the risk assessments made by the Company's credit department, lenders and loan committees. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit committee at least quarterly.\nRetail Other Loans\nthese loans is primarily dependent on the cash flows of the underlying property. However, commercial real estate loans generally must be supported by an adequate underlying collateral value. The performance and the value of the underlying property may be adversely affected by economic factors or geographical and/or industry specific factors. These loans are subject to other industry guidelines that are closely monitored by the Company.\nThe following table shows the deposit mix as of the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nThe ability of the Company to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to service its debt is dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its subsidiaries. Under applicable regulatory requirements, an Illinois state-chartered bank such as Busey Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. Because Busey Bank had been in an accumulated deficit position from 2009 thru 2018, it was not able to pay dividends in prior years. With prior approval from its regulators, however, an Illinois state-chartered bank in that situation was able to reduce its capital stock by amending its charter to decrease the authorized number of shares, and then make a subsequent distribution to its holding company. Using this approach, and with the approval of its regulators, Busey Bank has distributed funds to the Company, most recently in the amount of $40.0 million on October 12, 2018. Busey Bank returned to a positive retained earnings position in the second quarter of 2018 and, in 2019, returned to paying dividends.\nCommitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit totaled $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn addition to the Term Loan, long-term debt includes funds borrowed from the FHLB which totaled $35.6 million and $50.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFees for customer services were impacted by acquisition activity and increased to $36.7 million in 2019 as compared to $28.9 million in 2018. Evolving regulation, product changes and changing behaviors by our client base may impact the revenue derived from charges on deposit accounts in the future.\nCommercial Loans\nContractual Obligations\nNet Interest Income\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company reported non-performing loans of $29.5 million compared to $36.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans were 0.44% of total portfolio loans as of December 31, 2019 compared to 0.66% as of December 31, 2018. While these results are encouraging, asset quality metrics can be generally influenced by market-specific economic conditions, and specific measures may fluctuate from period to period. The key metrics are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nFair Value of Investment Securities. The fair values of investment securities are measurements from an independent pricing service and are based on observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security's terms and conditions, among other things. The use of different judgments and estimates to determine the fair value of securities could result in a different fair value estimate.\nThe ability of the Company to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to service its debt is dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its subsidiaries. Under applicable regulatory requirements, an Illinois state-chartered bank such as Busey Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. Because Busey Bank had been in an accumulated deficit position from 2009 thru 2018, it was not able to pay dividends in prior years. With prior approval from its regulators,\nLiquidity management is the process by which we ensure that adequate liquid funds are available to meet the present and future cash flow obligations arising in the daily operations of our business. These financial obligations consist of needs for funds to meet commitments to borrowers for extensions of credit, fund capital expenditures, honor withdrawals by customers, pay dividends to stockholders and pay operating expenses. Our most liquid assets are cash and due from banks, interest-bearing bank deposits and federal funds sold. The balances of these assets are dependent on the Company's operating, investing, lending, and financing activities during any given period.\n\nInvestment Securities\nOn May 25, 2017, the Company issued $40.0 million of 3.75% senior notes that mature on May 25, 2022. The senior notes are payable semi-annually on each May 25 and November 25, commencing on November 25, 2017. The senior notes are not subject to optional redemption by the Company. Additionally, on May 25, 2017, the Company issued $60.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes that mature on May 25, 2027. The subordinated notes, which qualify as Tier 2 capital for First Busey, bear interest at an annual rate of 4.75% for the first five years after issuance and thereafter bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.919%, as calculated on each applicable determination date. The subordinated notes are payable semi-annually on each May 25 and November 25, commencing on November 25, 2017 during the five year fixed-term and thereafter on February 25, May 25, August 25 and November 25 of each year, commencing on August 25, 2022. The subordinated notes have an optional redemption in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after May 25, 2022. The senior notes and subordinated notes are unsecured obligations of the Company. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes and subordinated\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured borrowings, generally mature daily. Short-term borrowings include FHLB advances which mature in less than one year from date of origination.\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 of First Busey and its subsidiaries. It should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business,\u201d Item 6. Selected Financial Data,\u201d the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nManagement attempts to mitigate the effects of an unpredictable interest-rate environment through effective portfolio management, prudent loan underwriting and operational efficiencies.\n\n (1) Securities are presented based upon final contractual maturity or pre-refunded date. \n (2) Weighted average yield calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21%. \nRetail Real Estate Loans\nThe Company views certain non-operating items, including acquisition-related and restructuring charges, as adjustments to net income reported under GAAP. Non-operating pretax adjustments for 2019 were $14.7 million of expenses related to acquisitions and $5.4 million of expenses related to other restructuring costs. The reconciliation of non-GAAP measures (including adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted net interest margin, adjusted efficiency ratio, tangible book value, tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity), which the Company believes facilitates the assessment of its financial results and peer comparability, is included in tabular form in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Non-GAAP Financial Information.\nNon-interest Expense (dollars in thousands)\nNet interest margin, our net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets stated on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.38% in 2019, which included a tax-equivalent adjustment of $3.0 million, compared to 3.45% in 2018, which included a tax-equivalent adjustment of $2.3 million.\nAverage liquid assets are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nFirst Busey has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nBorrowings\nAverage Balance Sheets and Interest Rates (continued)\n (2) Non-accrual loans have been included in average portfolio loans. \nCombined net occupancy expense of premises and furniture and equipment expenses of $27.7 million in 2019 increased as compared to $22.0 million in 2018. The increase was largely due to acquisitions, which in 2019 resulted in 20 additional facilities. We continue to evaluate our banking center network. The Company opened four banking centers and closed six banking centers in 2019.\nDeposits\nAllowance for Loan Losses. First Busey has established an allowance for loan losses which represents its estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and reduces the total loans outstanding by an estimate of uncollectible loans. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged against and reduce the allowance. A provision for loan losses is charged to current expense and acts to replenish the allowance for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at a level that management deems adequate. Acquired loans from business combinations with uncollected principal balances are carried net of a fair value adjustment for credit and interest rates. These loans are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the fair value adjustment. However, as the acquired loans renew, it is generally necessary to establish an allowance which represents an amount that, in management's opinion, will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses in such loans.\nRemittance processing revenue relates to our payment processing company, FirsTech. Remittance processing revenue of $15.0 million in 2019 increased compared to $14.3 million in 2018. Remittance processing adds important diversity to our revenue stream while widening our array of service offerings to larger commercial clients within our footprint and nationally.\n (1) On a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017. \nDetailed discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operation for 2019 as compared to 2018 can be found below. Comparison of 2018 to 2017 can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe composition of our portfolio loans as of the dates indicated was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $143.6 million in 2019 compared to $260.5 million used in financing activities in 2018. Significant items affecting cash flows from financing activities are debt issuance, deposits, short-term\nBalance Sheet\nWe focus on deepening our relationship with customers to foster core deposit growth, allowing us to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. As a result of this and the Banc Ed acquisition, non-maturity deposits increased by $1.6 billion, or 34.0%, to $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. Excluding deposits acquired in the Banc Ed acquisition, non-maturity deposits increased $379.1 million. Additionally, brokered deposits were $18.0 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $280.0 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of 93.6% from prior year. Time deposits as a percentage of total deposits decreased to 19.4% as of December 31, 2019 compared to 24.0% as of December 31, 2018. As time deposits mature, the Company is actively engaging our customers to renew at current market rates.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits were $140.5 million in 2019 compared to $107.8 million for the same period of 2018. Total full time equivalents at December 31, 2019 was 1,531 compared to 1,270 at December 31, 2018.\nWe consider many factors in determining the composition of our investment portfolio including, but not limited to, credit quality, duration, interest rate risk, liquidity, tax-equivalent yield, regulatory and overall portfolio allocation. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any non-U.S. Treasury securities or obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies issued securities that exceeded 10% of the Company's total stockholders' equity.\nWe have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments which generally relate to funding of operations through deposits, debt issuance, and property and equipment leases.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable First Busey will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan becomes impaired, management generally calculates the impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral-dependent or based on the discounted cash flows of the loan at the loan's effective interest rate. The amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded through a charge to the provision for loan losses. For collateral dependent loans, the allowance is based upon the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the applicable collateral. The required allowance or actual loss on an impaired loan could differ significantly if the ultimate fair value of the collateral is significantly different from the fair value estimate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nPortfolio Loans\nRetail real estate loans are comprised of direct consumer loans that include residential real estate, residential real estate construction loans, home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. In 2019, the Company sold the majority of its originated fixed rate retail real estate loans to secondary market purchasers. As retail real estate loan underwriting is subject to specific regulations, the Company typically underwrites its retail real estate loans to conform to widely accepted standards. Several factors are considered in underwriting including the value of the underlying real estate and the debt to income and credit history of the borrower.\nReal estate construction loans are typically commercial in nature. The loan proceeds are monitored by the Company and advanced for the improvement of real estate in which the Company holds a mortgage. Real estate construction loans will generally be guaranteed in full or a significant amount by the developer or primary owners of the business. These loans are subject to underwriting standards and guidelines similar to commercial loans. The loan generally must be supported by an adequate as completed\u201d value of the underlying project. In addition to the underlying project, the financial history of the developer and business owners weighs significantly in determining approval. The repayment of these loans is typically through permanent financing following completion of the construction. Real estate construction loans are inherently more risky than loans on completed properties as the unimproved nature and the financial risks of construction significantly enhance the risks of commercial real estate loans. These loans are closely monitored and subject to other industry guidelines.\nData processing expense in 2019 increased to $21.5 million compared to $16.4 million for the same period of 2018. Data processing included $2.4 million of non-operating expenses, related to the payment of merger and conversion expenses. Data processing for 2019 also includes data processing related to TheBANK from January 31, 2019 until merged with Busey Bank on October 4, 2019.\nInterest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $71.0 million, or 24.6%, to $359.2 million in 2019, from $288.3 million in 2018. The interest income increase related primarily to increases in loan volumes. Interest expense increased during 2019 by $24.4 million to $69.0 million from $44.6 million in 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily the result of higher funding costs combined with an increase in deposits and borrowings balances.\nOperating Performance\nCompany re-estimates the expected cash flows of the loans. Subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in the expected cash flows will generally be offset against the allowance for loan losses to the extent an allowance has been established or will be recognized as interest income prospectively.\nTotal non-performing loans and OREO were $32.6 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $37.0 million at December 31, 2018. Asset quality metrics remain dependent upon market-specific economic conditions, and specific measures may fluctuate from period to period.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Fair values are determined based on the definition of fair value\u201d defined in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\u201d\n\nOn August 31, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of IST, a Fort Myers, Florida wealth management firm. Through this transaction, Busey Bank and IST broaden the expertise and raise the level of service available to their clients-from individuals and families to institutions and foundations-and remain committed to their founding principles of being active community stewards and providing the highest level of personal service to clients delivered by experienced, local professionals.\n\nThe Company's lending can be summarized into five primary areas: commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, real estate construction loans, retail real estate loans, and retail other loans.\nCommercial loans typically comprise working capital loans or business expansion loans, including loans for asset purchases and other business loans. Commercial loans will generally be guaranteed in full or a significant amount by the primary owners of the business. Commercial loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the underlying borrower and secondarily on the underlying assets pledged as collateral by the borrower. The cash flows of the underlying borrower, however, may not perform consistently with historical or projected information. Further, the collateral securing loans may fluctuate in value due to individual economic or other factors. The Company has established minimum standards and underwriting guidelines for all commercial loan types.\nCapital Purchase Program Warrant\nCertain assets with tax favorable treatment are evaluated on a tax-equivalent basis. Tax-equivalent basis assumes an income tax rate of 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017. Tax favorable assets generally have lower contractual pre-tax yields than fully taxable assets. A tax-equivalent analysis is performed by adding the tax savings to the earnings on tax favorable assets. After factoring in the tax favorable effects of these assets, the yields may be more appropriately evaluated against alternative earning assets. In addition to yield, various other risks are factored into the evaluation process.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component considers loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when either the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying amount of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and classified loans not considered impaired and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss experience.\n\n\n\n\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\nLiquidity\n (1) For a reconciliation of adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure, see Non-GAAP Financial Information. \nCash Flows\nnotes totaled $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes and subordinated notes totaled $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018.\nRealized securities gains or losses are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Declines in the fair value of debt securities below their amortized cost are evaluated to determine whether such declines are temporary or OTTI. If the Company (i) has the intent to sell a debt security or (ii) will more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, then the Company recognizes the entire decline in fair value as an OTTI loss. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company evaluates whether a credit loss exists. The decline in fair value is separated into the amount of impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the impairment related to credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount of impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nAs of December 31, 2019, management believed the level of the allowance and coverage of non-performing loans to be appropriate based upon the information available. However, additional losses may be identified in our loan portfolio as new information is obtained.\nOther income of $8.6 million in 2019 increased as compared to $6.2 million in 2018 across multiple revenue sources, including swap origination fee income.\nThe composition of debt securities available for sale was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nAmortization of intangible assets was $9.5 million in 2019 as compared to $5.9 million in 2018 as a result of increases in intangible asset balances from acquisitions.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. Determining the fair value often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Goodwill is not amortized, instead, the Company assess the potential for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.\nManagement reviews and approves the Company's lending policies and procedures on a regular basis. Management routinely (at least quarterly) reviews the Company's allowance for loan losses in conjunction with reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing and potential problem loans. The Company's underwriting standards are designed to encourage relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Relationship banking implies a primary banking relationship with the borrower that includes, at a minimum, an active deposit banking relationship in addition to the lending relationship. Significant underwriting factors in addition to location, duration, a sound and profitable cash flow basis and the borrower's character include the quality of the borrower's financial history, the liquidity of the underlying collateral and the reliability of the valuation of the underlying collateral.\nFirst Busey's primary sources of funds consist of deposits, investment maturities and sales, loan principal repayments, and capital funds. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve, First Busey's revolving loan facility, or to utilize brokered deposits.\nThe Company believes that making sound and profitable loans is a necessary and desirable means of employing funds available for investment. The Company maintains lending policies and procedures designed to focus lending efforts on the types, locations and duration of loans most appropriate for its business model and markets. While not specifically limited, the Company attempts to focus its lending on short to intermediate-term (0-7 years) loans in geographic areas within 125 miles of its lending offices. Loans originated outside of these areas are generally residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market or loans to existing customers of the bank. The Company attempts to utilize government-assisted lending programs, such as the Small Business Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture lending programs, when prudent. Generally, loans are collateralized by assets, primarily real estate and guaranteed by individuals. The loans are expected to be repaid primarily from cash flows of the borrowers or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination generally requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than other assets acquired or liabilities assumed. At the date of acquisition, when loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. At each future reporting date, the\nSignificant Balance Sheet Items (dollars in thousands)\nIn connection with the Company's participation in the Capital Purchase Program, the Company issued to Treasury a warrant to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. At December 31, 2019, this warrant to purchase 191,278 shares of the Company's common stock, at an exercise price of $39.21, remained outstanding.\nOther expense of $48.5 million in 2019 increased as compared to $35.5 million in 2018. Variances are across multiple expense categories, including business development and marketing expenses, branch impairment and acquisition-related check card service expense.\nNet interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $46.6 million, or 19.1%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The Federal Open Market Committee lowered Federal Funds Target Rates for the first time in 11 years on July 31, 2019 and then again on September 18, 2019 and October 30, 2019, for a combined decrease of 75 basis points during 2019. This contributed to the decline in net interest margin during the second half of 2019 as assets, in particular commercial loans, repriced more quickly and to a greater extent than liabilities.\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of First Busey's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex. These estimates involve judgments, assumptions and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of a materially different financial condition or materially different results of operations is a reasonable likelihood. Further, changes in accounting standards could impact the Company's critical accounting estimates. The following policies could be deemed critical:\nThe following table sets forth information concerning non-performing loans and performing restructured loans at December 31 for each of the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nWealth management fees increased to $38.6 million, or 24.5%, in 2019 compared to $31.0 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, assets under care were approximately $9.7 billion compared to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2018. At the time of acquisition, Banc Ed added $1.5 billion in assets under care and IST added $0.5 million in assets under care, with the balance of year over year growth being organic.\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of short-term borrowings and weighted average interest rates thereon (dollars in thousands):\nReal Estate Construction Loans\n (3) Interest income includes a tax-equivalent adjustment of $3.0 million, $2.3 million and $3.7 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nFirst Busey maintains statutory trusts for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing trust preferred securities and related trust common securities. The proceeds from such issuances were used by the trusts to purchase junior subordinated notes of the Company, which are the sole assets of each trust. Concurrent with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, the Company issued guarantees for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities are instruments that qualify, and are treated by the Company, as Tier 1 regulatory capital. The Company owns all of the common securities of each trust. The trust preferred securities issued by each trust rank equally with the common securities in right of payment, except that if an event of default under the indenture governing the notes has occurred and is continuing, the preferred securities will rank senior to the common securities in right of payment. In connection with the Pulaski acquisition in 2016, the Company acquired similar statutory trusts maintained by Pulaski and the fair value adjustment is being accreted over the weighted average remaining life. The Company had $71.3 million and $71.2 million of junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated trusts at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the allowance for loan losses by loan categories and percentage of loans to total loans as of December 31 for each of the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nOperating Results (dollars in thousands)\nThe following table shows activity affecting the allowance for loan losses (dollars in thousands):\nLoans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management's opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory guidelines. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\n\nAsset Quality\nIncome Taxes\nProfessional fees of $11.1 million in 2019 increased by $5.7 million as compared to $5.4 million in 2018. Professional fees were influenced by acquisition expenses and other restructuring costs as well as Company initiatives.\nNet cash provided by investing activities totaled $65.0 million in 2019 compared to $55.4 million used in investing activities in 2018. Significant items affecting cash flows from investing activities are those activities associated with managing the Company's investment and loan portfolios and cash received/paid in acquisitions. The Company experienced a net increase in loans of $244.3 million in 2019 compared to $49.9 million in 2018, excluding acquired loans.\nDebt securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Debt securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Equity securities are carried at fair value. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value and amortized cost of debt securities available for sale were $1.6 billion. There were $22.0 million of gross unrealized gains and $0.8 million of gross unrealized losses for a net unrealized loss of $21.2 million. The net unrealized loss, net of tax, is recorded in stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any debt securities held to maturity. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of equity securities was $6.0 million.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate levels and volume fluctuations within earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income. Net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets.\nJunior Subordinated Debt Owed to Unconsolidated Trusts\nThe following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\n\nborrowings, long-term debt, payment of dividends and proceeds and redemption from stock issuances. Deposits, which represent the Company's primary funding source, increased by $215.6 million in 2019 compared to an increase of $123.6 million in 2018, excluding acquired deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $30.9 million in 2019 compared to $118.8 million in 2018.\nRevenues from trust fees, commissions and brokers' fees, and remittance processing activities represented 46.0% of the Company's non-interest income in 2019, providing a balance to spread-based revenue from traditional banking activities. Further, non-interest income, excluding net security losses, represented 28.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTotal average interest-bearing liability balances increased $1.2 billion, or 22.3%, to $6.4 billion in 2019 as compared to $5.2 billion in 2018. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $254.7 million, or 17.1%, to $1.7 billion in 2019, as compared to $1.5 billion in 2018. Average non-interest bearing deposits represented 22.8% of total average deposits in 2019. The Company remains strongly core deposit funded with total average deposits in 2019 representing 92.9% of total average liabilities, with solid liquidity and significant market share in the communities we serve.\nOn January 29, 2019, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement providing for a $60.0 million term loan (the Term Loan\u201d) with a maturity date of November 30, 2023. The Term Loan has an annual interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.50%. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to fund the cash consideration related to the acquisition of Banc Ed. The Company had $54.0 million outstanding indebtedness on December 31, 2019, comprised of $6.0 million of short-term borrowings and $48.0 million of long-term debt. The Term Loan is redeemable by the Company at its option at any time prior to maturity.\nThe Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Information relating to accounting pronouncements issued and applicable to the Company in 2019 appears in Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "On October 4, 2019, in addition to the merger of TheBANK into Busey Bank, the Company partnered with a new core operating system provider. The core conversion positions the combined organization for future growth and will allow the Company to serve customers more efficiently and effectively for years to come.\nNon-performing Loans\n\nThe provision for loan losses was $10.4 million in 2019, $4.4 million in 2018 and $5.3 million in 2017. As a result of acquisitions, the Company is holding acquired loans that are carried net of a fair value adjustment for credit and interest rate marks and are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the fair value adjustment. However, as the acquired loans renew and as the Company originates new loan production, it is necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses, which represents an amount that, in management's opinion, will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses.\nPortfolio loans increased $1.1 billion, or 20.1%, as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 as a result of the Banc Ed acquisition and organic growth. Commercial balances (consisting of commercial, commercial real estate and real estate construction loans) increased $883.5 million from December 31, 2018. Retail real estate and retail other loans increased $235.3 million from December 31, 2018.\n\nTypically, loans are secured by collateral. When a loan is classified as non-accrual and determined to be collateral dependent, it is appropriately reserved or charged down through the allowance for loan losses to the fair value of our interest in the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. Our loan portfolio is collateralized primarily by real estate.\n (4) Includes short-term and long-term borrowings. Interest expense includes a non-usage fee on revolving loan. \nThe provision for loan losses is a current charge against income and represents an amount which management believes is sufficient to maintain an appropriate allowance for probable losses in the loan portfolio. In assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, management considers the size and quality of the loan portfolio measured against prevailing economic conditions, regulatory guidelines, historical loan loss experience and credit quality of the portfolio. When a determination is made by management to charge-off a loan balance, a write-off is charged against the allowance for loan losses. We continue to attempt to identify problem loan situations on a proactive basis. Once problem loans are identified, adjustments to the provision for loan losses are made based upon all information available at that time.\nThe effect of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from the effect on an industrial company. While a financial institution's operating expenses, particularly salaries, wages and employee benefits, are affected by general inflation, the asset and liability structure of a financial institution consists largely of monetary items. Monetary items, such as cash, loans and deposits, are those assets and liabilities which are or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than does general inflation. For additional information regarding interest rates and changes in net interest income see Results of Operations - Average Balance Sheets and Interest Rates and\n\nThe following table sets forth remaining maturities of selected loans (excluding deferred loan fees and costs and purchase premiums and discounts and certain real estate-mortgage loans and installment loans to individuals) at December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nEarning Assets, Sources of Funds, and Net Interest Margin\nThe quarterly net interest margins were as follows:\nMortgage revenue of $11.7 million in 2019 increased $6.2 million compared to $5.5 million in 2018, following a long period of restructuring and as a result of additional revenue from TheBANK. A decline in prevailing market rates for mortgages also contributed to increased production in recent periods.\nSensitive assets include non-accrual loans, loans on our classified loan reports and other loans identified as having more than reasonable potential for loss. Management reviews sensitive assets on at least a quarterly basis for changes in each applicable customer's ability to pay and changes in valuation of underlying collateral in order to estimate probable losses. The majority of these loans are being repaid in conformance with their contracts.\nThe commercial environment, along with the academic presence in some of the Company's markets, provides for the majority of the Company's commercial lending opportunities to be commercial real estate related, including multi-unit housing. As the majority of the Company's loan portfolio is within the commercial real estate class, the Company's goal is to maintain a high quality, geographically diverse portfolio of commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and guidelines similar to commercial loans. Commercial real estate loans will generally be guaranteed in full or a significant amount by the primary owners of the business. The repayment of\nTotal non-interest expense of $258.8 million in 2019 increased by $65.8 million as compared to $193.0 million in 2018. Total non-interest expenses have been influenced by acquisition expenses and other restructuring costs. The Company remains focused on expense discipline and expects additional expense savings from the integration of prior acquisitions and recent core operating system conversion efforts to be realized over the next year.\nIn connection with the First Community acquisition, the Company assumed $15.3 million in subordinated debt, of which $9.8 million was simultaneously redeemed. A $0.3 million purchase accounting premium was recorded on the remaining balance of the subordinated debt. On September 30, 2018, the Company, at its option, redeemed the balance of the subordinated debt at a redemption price equal to the principal amount outstanding plus accrued but unpaid interest.\n\nOur capital ratios are in excess of those required to be considered well-capitalized\u201d pursuant to applicable regulatory guidelines. The Federal Reserve Board uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks. Risk-based capital ratios are established by allocating assets and certain off-balance-sheet commitments into risk-weighted categories. These balances are then multiplied by the factor appropriate for that risk-weighted category. In order to refrain from restrictions on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments, banking institutions must maintain minimum ratios of (i) Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. As of December 31, 2019, First Busey had a total capital to total risk-weighted asset ratio of 14.03%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 12.49%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 11.49% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.88%; Busey Bank had ratios of 14.92%, 14.19%, 14.19% and 11.19%, respectively. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since December 31, 2019 that would materially adversely change the Company's or Busey Bank's capital classifications.\nResults of Operation - Three Years Ended December 31, 2019\nPotential problem loans are those loans which are not categorized as impaired, restructured, non-accrual or 90+ days past due, but where current information indicates that the borrower may not be able to comply with loan repayment terms. Management assesses the potential for loss on such loans and considers the effect of any potential loss in determining its provision for probable loan losses. Potential problem loans totaled $74.6 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $70.9 million at December 31, 2018. Management continues to monitor these credits and anticipates that restructurings, guarantees, additional collateral or other planned actions will result in full repayment of the debts. As of December 31, 2019, management identified no other loans that represent or result from trends or uncertainties which would be expected to materially impact future operating results, liquidity or capital resources.\nThe following tables (dollars in thousands) show our Consolidated Average Balance Sheets, detailing the major categories of assets and liabilities, the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, the interest expense paid for the interest-bearing liabilities, and the related interest rates for the periods shown. The tables also show, for the periods indicated, a summary of the changes in interest earned and interest expense resulting from changes in volume and rates for the major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on changes due to rate and changes due to volume. All average information is provided on a daily average basis.\nChanges in Net Interest Income:\nAt no time is a borrower's total borrowing relationship permitted to exceed the Company's regulatory lending limit. The Company generally limits such relationships to amounts substantially less than the regulatory limit. Loans to related parties, including executive officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries, are reviewed for compliance with regulatory guidelines by the Company's board of directors at least annually.\nOn January 31, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Banc Ed, the holding company for TheBANK. First Busey operated TheBANK as a separate subsidiary from the completion of the acquisition until October 4, 2019, when it was merged with and into Busey Bank. When we completed the Banc Ed acquisition, we reset the baseline for the future financial performance of First Busey. With TheBANK now merged and integrated, we expect to see the full contribution and synergies of TheBANK reflected in the Company's financial performance in the years ahead.\nThe efficiency ratio(3) is calculated as total non-interest expense, less amortization charges, as a percentage of tax-equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income, less security gains and losses. The efficiency ratio, which is a measure commonly used by management and the banking industry, measures the amount of expense incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio was 61.3% in 2019 as compared to 56.2% in 2018. Operating costs have been influenced by acquisition expenses and other restructuring costs and the adjusted efficiency ratio(3) was 56.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. While acquisition expenses may have a negative impact on the efficiency ratios, the Company expects to realize operating efficiencies creating a positive impact in future years.\n\nThe primary purposes of the investment securities portfolio are to provide a source of liquidity; to provide collateral for pledging purposes against public monies and repurchase agreements; to serve as a tool for interest rate risk positioning; and to provide a source of earnings by deploying funds which are not needed to fulfill loan demand, deposit redemptions or other liquidity purposes. Pledged securities totaled $704.7 million, or 42.8% of total securities, and $498.3 million, or 38.0% of total securities, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe composition of debt securities held to maturity was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nhowever, an Illinois state-chartered bank in that situation was able to reduce its capital stock by amending its charter to decrease the authorized number of shares, and then make a subsequent distribution to its holding company. Using this approach, and with the approval of its regulators, Busey Bank has distributed funds to the Company, most recently in the amount of $40.0 million on October 12, 2018. Busey Bank returned to a positive retained earnings position in the second quarter of 2018 and, in 2019, returned to paying dividends.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also retained the Company's $20.0 million revolving facility with a maturity date of April 30, 2019. On April 19, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity of its revolving loan facility to April 30, 2020. The revolving facility incurs a non-usage fee based on the undrawn amount. The Company had no outstanding balance under the revolving facility on December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nThe net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.10% in 2019 compared to 3.23% in 2018, each on a tax-equivalent basis.\nThe effective income tax rate, or income taxes divided by income before taxes, was 23.4% and 26.1% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by an increase in tax exempt income combined with the benefits received from tax credit investments. The Company continues to monitor evolving federal and state tax legislation and its potential impact on operations on an ongoing basis.\nOur allowance for loan losses was $53.7 million, or 0.80% of portfolio loans, and $50.6 million, or 0.91% of portfolio loans, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a result of acquisitions, the Company is holding $1.7 billion of acquired loans that are carried net of a fair value adjustment of $20.2 million for credit and interest rate marks and are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the fair value adjustment.\nRetail other loans consist of installment loans to individuals, including automotive loans. These loans are centrally underwritten utilizing the borrower's financial history, including the FICO credit scoring and information as to the underlying collateral. Repayment is expected from the cash flow of the borrower.\n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $80.8 million in 2019 compared to $202.5 million in 2018. Significant items affecting the cash flows provided by operating activities include net income, depreciation, amortization expenses, the provision for loan losses, deferred income taxes, gain on sales of mortgage loans, net of origination costs and activities related to the origination and sales of loans held for sale. Net cash used to originate loans held for sale totaled $25.7 million in 2019 compared to $79.4 million of net cash provided by loan sales in 2018. Fluctuations in sales are a function of changes in market rates for mortgage loans, which influence refinance activity.\nRegulatory Capital\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe maturities, fair values and weighted average yields of debt securities available for sale as of December 31, 2019 were (dollars in thousands):\nTotal non-interest income of $116.4 million increased $26.4 million from $90.0 million in 2018. The 2019 increases reflect organic growth as well as the 2019 acquisitions of Banc Ed and IST.\nEffects of Inflation\nTo determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, a formal analysis is completed quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio. This assessment is reviewed by the Company's senior management. The analysis includes a review of historical performance, dollar amount and trends of past due loans, dollar amount and trends in non-performing loans, certain impaired loans, and loans identified as sensitive assets. Sensitive assets include non-accrual loans, past-due loans, loans on First Busey's watch loan reports and other loans identified as having probable potential for loss.\nThe Bank routinely enters into commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding loan commitments and standby letters of credit of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The balance of commitments to extend credit represents future cash requirements and some of these commitments may expire without being drawn upon. We anticipate we will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments, including loan applications received and in process prior to the issuance of firm commitments.\nThe Consolidated Average Balance Sheets and interest rates were impacted by the 2019 acquisitions of Banc Ed, along with organic growth. Total average interest-earning assets increased $1.5 billion, or 21.5%, to $8.6 billion in 2019, as compared to $7.1 billion in 2018. Average loans increased and generally have notably higher yields compared to interest-bearing bank deposits and investment securities, so the loan growth contributed to a positive effect on net interest margin.\n\nPotential Problem Loans\nNet income for the full year 2019 was $103.0 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $98.9 million, or $2.01 per diluted common share, for the full year 2018. Adjusted net income(1) for the full year 2019 was $118.4 million, or $2.15 per diluted common share, compared to $103.5 million or $2.10 per diluted common share for the full year 2018.\nNon-interest Income (dollars in thousands)\nAs of December 31, 2019, management believed that adequate liquidity existed to meet all projected cash flow obligations. We seek to achieve a satisfactory degree of liquidity by actively managing both assets and liabilities. Asset management guides the proportion of liquid assets to total assets, while liability management monitors future funding requirements and prices liabilities accordingly.\n (1) The weighted average interest rate is computed by dividing total interest for the period by the average daily balance outstanding. \nAverage Balance Sheets and Interest Rates\n (3) For a reconciliation of efficiency ratio and adjusted efficiency ratio, non-GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Financial Information. \nGeographic distributions of portfolio loans, based on origination, by category were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nIncome on bank owned life insurance increased $2.1 million, or 55.5%, in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of the Banc Ed acquisition and life insurance proceeds.\n\nIncome Taxes. The Company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to federal and state tax jurisdictions. Estimated income tax expense is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accrued and deferred taxes, as reported in other assets or other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or in the future. Management judgment is involved in estimating accrued and deferred taxes, as it may be necessary to evaluate the risks and merits of the tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, and taxable income calculations after considering tax-related statutes, regulations and other relevant factors. Because of the complexity of tax laws and interpretations, interpretation is subject to judgment.\nCapital Resources\nThe Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews the loans for compliance with the Company's loan policy on a periodic basis. In addition, the loan review department reviews the risk assessments made by the Company's credit department, lenders and loan committees. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit committee at least quarterly.\nRetail Other Loans\nthese loans is primarily dependent on the cash flows of the underlying property. However, commercial real estate loans generally must be supported by an adequate underlying collateral value. The performance and the value of the underlying property may be adversely affected by economic factors or geographical and/or industry specific factors. These loans are subject to other industry guidelines that are closely monitored by the Company.\nThe following table shows the deposit mix as of the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nThe ability of the Company to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to service its debt is dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its subsidiaries. Under applicable regulatory requirements, an Illinois state-chartered bank such as Busey Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. Because Busey Bank had been in an accumulated deficit position from 2009 thru 2018, it was not able to pay dividends in prior years. With prior approval from its regulators, however, an Illinois state-chartered bank in that situation was able to reduce its capital stock by amending its charter to decrease the authorized number of shares, and then make a subsequent distribution to its holding company. Using this approach, and with the approval of its regulators, Busey Bank has distributed funds to the Company, most recently in the amount of $40.0 million on October 12, 2018. Busey Bank returned to a positive retained earnings position in the second quarter of 2018 and, in 2019, returned to paying dividends.\nCommitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit totaled $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn addition to the Term Loan, long-term debt includes funds borrowed from the FHLB which totaled $35.6 million and $50.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFees for customer services were impacted by acquisition activity and increased to $36.7 million in 2019 as compared to $28.9 million in 2018. Evolving regulation, product changes and changing behaviors by our client base may impact the revenue derived from charges on deposit accounts in the future.\nCommercial Loans\nContractual Obligations\nNet Interest Income\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company reported non-performing loans of $29.5 million compared to $36.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans were 0.44% of total portfolio loans as of December 31, 2019 compared to 0.66% as of December 31, 2018. While these results are encouraging, asset quality metrics can be generally influenced by market-specific economic conditions, and specific measures may fluctuate from period to period. The key metrics are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nFair Value of Investment Securities. The fair values of investment securities are measurements from an independent pricing service and are based on observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security's terms and conditions, among other things. The use of different judgments and estimates to determine the fair value of securities could result in a different fair value estimate.\nThe ability of the Company to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to service its debt is dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its subsidiaries. Under applicable regulatory requirements, an Illinois state-chartered bank such as Busey Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. Because Busey Bank had been in an accumulated deficit position from 2009 thru 2018, it was not able to pay dividends in prior years. With prior approval from its regulators,\nLiquidity management is the process by which we ensure that adequate liquid funds are available to meet the present and future cash flow obligations arising in the daily operations of our business. These financial obligations consist of needs for funds to meet commitments to borrowers for extensions of credit, fund capital expenditures, honor withdrawals by customers, pay dividends to stockholders and pay operating expenses. Our most liquid assets are cash and due from banks, interest-bearing bank deposits and federal funds sold. The balances of these assets are dependent on the Company's operating, investing, lending, and financing activities during any given period.\n\nInvestment Securities\nOn May 25, 2017, the Company issued $40.0 million of 3.75% senior notes that mature on May 25, 2022. The senior notes are payable semi-annually on each May 25 and November 25, commencing on November 25, 2017. The senior notes are not subject to optional redemption by the Company. Additionally, on May 25, 2017, the Company issued $60.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes that mature on May 25, 2027. The subordinated notes, which qualify as Tier 2 capital for First Busey, bear interest at an annual rate of 4.75% for the first five years after issuance and thereafter bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.919%, as calculated on each applicable determination date. The subordinated notes are payable semi-annually on each May 25 and November 25, commencing on November 25, 2017 during the five year fixed-term and thereafter on February 25, May 25, August 25 and November 25 of each year, commencing on August 25, 2022. The subordinated notes have an optional redemption in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after May 25, 2022. The senior notes and subordinated notes are unsecured obligations of the Company. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes and subordinated\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured borrowings, generally mature daily. Short-term borrowings include FHLB advances which mature in less than one year from date of origination.\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 of First Busey and its subsidiaries. It should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business,\u201d Item 6. Selected Financial Data,\u201d the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nManagement attempts to mitigate the effects of an unpredictable interest-rate environment through effective portfolio management, prudent loan underwriting and operational efficiencies.\n\n (1) Securities are presented based upon final contractual maturity or pre-refunded date. \n (2) Weighted average yield calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21%. \nRetail Real Estate Loans\nThe Company views certain non-operating items, including acquisition-related and restructuring charges, as adjustments to net income reported under GAAP. Non-operating pretax adjustments for 2019 were $14.7 million of expenses related to acquisitions and $5.4 million of expenses related to other restructuring costs. The reconciliation of non-GAAP measures (including adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted net interest margin, adjusted efficiency ratio, tangible book value, tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity), which the Company believes facilitates the assessment of its financial results and peer comparability, is included in tabular form in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Non-GAAP Financial Information.\nNon-interest Expense (dollars in thousands)\nNet interest margin, our net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets stated on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.38% in 2019, which included a tax-equivalent adjustment of $3.0 million, compared to 3.45% in 2018, which included a tax-equivalent adjustment of $2.3 million.\nAverage liquid assets are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nFirst Busey has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nBorrowings\nAverage Balance Sheets and Interest Rates (continued)\n (2) Non-accrual loans have been included in average portfolio loans. \nCombined net occupancy expense of premises and furniture and equipment expenses of $27.7 million in 2019 increased as compared to $22.0 million in 2018. The increase was largely due to acquisitions, which in 2019 resulted in 20 additional facilities. We continue to evaluate our banking center network. The Company opened four banking centers and closed six banking centers in 2019.\nDeposits\nAllowance for Loan Losses. First Busey has established an allowance for loan losses which represents its estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and reduces the total loans outstanding by an estimate of uncollectible loans. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged against and reduce the allowance. A provision for loan losses is charged to current expense and acts to replenish the allowance for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at a level that management deems adequate. Acquired loans from business combinations with uncollected principal balances are carried net of a fair value adjustment for credit and interest rates. These loans are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the fair value adjustment. However, as the acquired loans renew, it is generally necessary to establish an allowance which represents an amount that, in management's opinion, will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses in such loans.\nRemittance processing revenue relates to our payment processing company, FirsTech. Remittance processing revenue of $15.0 million in 2019 increased compared to $14.3 million in 2018. Remittance processing adds important diversity to our revenue stream while widening our array of service offerings to larger commercial clients within our footprint and nationally.\n (1) On a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017. \nDetailed discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operation for 2019 as compared to 2018 can be found below. Comparison of 2018 to 2017 can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe composition of our portfolio loans as of the dates indicated was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $143.6 million in 2019 compared to $260.5 million used in financing activities in 2018. Significant items affecting cash flows from financing activities are debt issuance, deposits, short-term\nBalance Sheet\nWe focus on deepening our relationship with customers to foster core deposit growth, allowing us to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. As a result of this and the Banc Ed acquisition, non-maturity deposits increased by $1.6 billion, or 34.0%, to $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. Excluding deposits acquired in the Banc Ed acquisition, non-maturity deposits increased $379.1 million. Additionally, brokered deposits were $18.0 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $280.0 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of 93.6% from prior year. Time deposits as a percentage of total deposits decreased to 19.4% as of December 31, 2019 compared to 24.0% as of December 31, 2018. As time deposits mature, the Company is actively engaging our customers to renew at current market rates.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits were $140.5 million in 2019 compared to $107.8 million for the same period of 2018. Total full time equivalents at December 31, 2019 was 1,531 compared to 1,270 at December 31, 2018.\nWe consider many factors in determining the composition of our investment portfolio including, but not limited to, credit quality, duration, interest rate risk, liquidity, tax-equivalent yield, regulatory and overall portfolio allocation. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any non-U.S. Treasury securities or obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies issued securities that exceeded 10% of the Company's total stockholders' equity.\nWe have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments which generally relate to funding of operations through deposits, debt issuance, and property and equipment leases.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable First Busey will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan becomes impaired, management generally calculates the impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral-dependent or based on the discounted cash flows of the loan at the loan's effective interest rate. The amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded through a charge to the provision for loan losses. For collateral dependent loans, the allowance is based upon the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the applicable collateral. The required allowance or actual loss on an impaired loan could differ significantly if the ultimate fair value of the collateral is significantly different from the fair value estimate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nPortfolio Loans\nRetail real estate loans are comprised of direct consumer loans that include residential real estate, residential real estate construction loans, home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. In 2019, the Company sold the majority of its originated fixed rate retail real estate loans to secondary market purchasers. As retail real estate loan underwriting is subject to specific regulations, the Company typically underwrites its retail real estate loans to conform to widely accepted standards. Several factors are considered in underwriting including the value of the underlying real estate and the debt to income and credit history of the borrower.\nReal estate construction loans are typically commercial in nature. The loan proceeds are monitored by the Company and advanced for the improvement of real estate in which the Company holds a mortgage. Real estate construction loans will generally be guaranteed in full or a significant amount by the developer or primary owners of the business. These loans are subject to underwriting standards and guidelines similar to commercial loans. The loan generally must be supported by an adequate as completed\u201d value of the underlying project. In addition to the underlying project, the financial history of the developer and business owners weighs significantly in determining approval. The repayment of these loans is typically through permanent financing following completion of the construction. Real estate construction loans are inherently more risky than loans on completed properties as the unimproved nature and the financial risks of construction significantly enhance the risks of commercial real estate loans. These loans are closely monitored and subject to other industry guidelines.\nData processing expense in 2019 increased to $21.5 million compared to $16.4 million for the same period of 2018. Data processing included $2.4 million of non-operating expenses, related to the payment of merger and conversion expenses. Data processing for 2019 also includes data processing related to TheBANK from January 31, 2019 until merged with Busey Bank on October 4, 2019.\nInterest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $71.0 million, or 24.6%, to $359.2 million in 2019, from $288.3 million in 2018. The interest income increase related primarily to increases in loan volumes. Interest expense increased during 2019 by $24.4 million to $69.0 million from $44.6 million in 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily the result of higher funding costs combined with an increase in deposits and borrowings balances.\nOperating Performance\nCompany re-estimates the expected cash flows of the loans. Subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in the expected cash flows will generally be offset against the allowance for loan losses to the extent an allowance has been established or will be recognized as interest income prospectively.\nTotal non-performing loans and OREO were $32.6 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $37.0 million at December 31, 2018. Asset quality metrics remain dependent upon market-specific economic conditions, and specific measures may fluctuate from period to period.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Fair values are determined based on the definition of fair value\u201d defined in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\u201d\n\nOn August 31, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of IST, a Fort Myers, Florida wealth management firm. Through this transaction, Busey Bank and IST broaden the expertise and raise the level of service available to their clients-from individuals and families to institutions and foundations-and remain committed to their founding principles of being active community stewards and providing the highest level of personal service to clients delivered by experienced, local professionals.\n\nThe Company's lending can be summarized into five primary areas: commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, real estate construction loans, retail real estate loans, and retail other loans.\nCommercial loans typically comprise working capital loans or business expansion loans, including loans for asset purchases and other business loans. Commercial loans will generally be guaranteed in full or a significant amount by the primary owners of the business. Commercial loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the underlying borrower and secondarily on the underlying assets pledged as collateral by the borrower. The cash flows of the underlying borrower, however, may not perform consistently with historical or projected information. Further, the collateral securing loans may fluctuate in value due to individual economic or other factors. The Company has established minimum standards and underwriting guidelines for all commercial loan types.\nCapital Purchase Program Warrant\nCertain assets with tax favorable treatment are evaluated on a tax-equivalent basis. Tax-equivalent basis assumes an income tax rate of 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017. Tax favorable assets generally have lower contractual pre-tax yields than fully taxable assets. A tax-equivalent analysis is performed by adding the tax savings to the earnings on tax favorable assets. After factoring in the tax favorable effects of these assets, the yields may be more appropriately evaluated against alternative earning assets. In addition to yield, various other risks are factored into the evaluation process.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component considers loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when either the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying amount of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and classified loans not considered impaired and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss experience.\n\n\n\n\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\nLiquidity\n (1) For a reconciliation of adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure, see Non-GAAP Financial Information. \nCash Flows\nnotes totaled $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes and subordinated notes totaled $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018.\nRealized securities gains or losses are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Declines in the fair value of debt securities below their amortized cost are evaluated to determine whether such declines are temporary or OTTI. If the Company (i) has the intent to sell a debt security or (ii) will more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, then the Company recognizes the entire decline in fair value as an OTTI loss. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company evaluates whether a credit loss exists. The decline in fair value is separated into the amount of impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the impairment related to credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount of impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nAs of December 31, 2019, management believed the level of the allowance and coverage of non-performing loans to be appropriate based upon the information available. However, additional losses may be identified in our loan portfolio as new information is obtained.\nOther income of $8.6 million in 2019 increased as compared to $6.2 million in 2018 across multiple revenue sources, including swap origination fee income.\nThe composition of debt securities available for sale was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nAmortization of intangible assets was $9.5 million in 2019 as compared to $5.9 million in 2018 as a result of increases in intangible asset balances from acquisitions.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. Determining the fair value often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Goodwill is not amortized, instead, the Company assess the potential for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.\nManagement reviews and approves the Company's lending policies and procedures on a regular basis. Management routinely (at least quarterly) reviews the Company's allowance for loan losses in conjunction with reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing and potential problem loans. The Company's underwriting standards are designed to encourage relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Relationship banking implies a primary banking relationship with the borrower that includes, at a minimum, an active deposit banking relationship in addition to the lending relationship. Significant underwriting factors in addition to location, duration, a sound and profitable cash flow basis and the borrower's character include the quality of the borrower's financial history, the liquidity of the underlying collateral and the reliability of the valuation of the underlying collateral.\nFirst Busey's primary sources of funds consist of deposits, investment maturities and sales, loan principal repayments, and capital funds. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve, First Busey's revolving loan facility, or to utilize brokered deposits.\nThe Company believes that making sound and profitable loans is a necessary and desirable means of employing funds available for investment. The Company maintains lending policies and procedures designed to focus lending efforts on the types, locations and duration of loans most appropriate for its business model and markets. While not specifically limited, the Company attempts to focus its lending on short to intermediate-term (0-7 years) loans in geographic areas within 125 miles of its lending offices. Loans originated outside of these areas are generally residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market or loans to existing customers of the bank. The Company attempts to utilize government-assisted lending programs, such as the Small Business Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture lending programs, when prudent. Generally, loans are collateralized by assets, primarily real estate and guaranteed by individuals. The loans are expected to be repaid primarily from cash flows of the borrowers or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination generally requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than other assets acquired or liabilities assumed. At the date of acquisition, when loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. At each future reporting date, the\nSignificant Balance Sheet Items (dollars in thousands)\nIn connection with the Company's participation in the Capital Purchase Program, the Company issued to Treasury a warrant to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. At December 31, 2019, this warrant to purchase 191,278 shares of the Company's common stock, at an exercise price of $39.21, remained outstanding.\nOther expense of $48.5 million in 2019 increased as compared to $35.5 million in 2018. Variances are across multiple expense categories, including business development and marketing expenses, branch impairment and acquisition-related check card service expense.\nNet interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $46.6 million, or 19.1%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The Federal Open Market Committee lowered Federal Funds Target Rates for the first time in 11 years on July 31, 2019 and then again on September 18, 2019 and October 30, 2019, for a combined decrease of 75 basis points during 2019. This contributed to the decline in net interest margin during the second half of 2019 as assets, in particular commercial loans, repriced more quickly and to a greater extent than liabilities.\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of First Busey's financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex. These estimates involve judgments, assumptions and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of a materially different financial condition or materially different results of operations is a reasonable likelihood. Further, changes in accounting standards could impact the Company's critical accounting estimates. The following policies could be deemed critical:\nThe following table sets forth information concerning non-performing loans and performing restructured loans at December 31 for each of the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nWealth management fees increased to $38.6 million, or 24.5%, in 2019 compared to $31.0 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, assets under care were approximately $9.7 billion compared to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2018. At the time of acquisition, Banc Ed added $1.5 billion in assets under care and IST added $0.5 million in assets under care, with the balance of year over year growth being organic.\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of short-term borrowings and weighted average interest rates thereon (dollars in thousands):\nReal Estate Construction Loans\n (3) Interest income includes a tax-equivalent adjustment of $3.0 million, $2.3 million and $3.7 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nFirst Busey maintains statutory trusts for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing trust preferred securities and related trust common securities. The proceeds from such issuances were used by the trusts to purchase junior subordinated notes of the Company, which are the sole assets of each trust. Concurrent with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, the Company issued guarantees for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities are instruments that qualify, and are treated by the Company, as Tier 1 regulatory capital. The Company owns all of the common securities of each trust. The trust preferred securities issued by each trust rank equally with the common securities in right of payment, except that if an event of default under the indenture governing the notes has occurred and is continuing, the preferred securities will rank senior to the common securities in right of payment. In connection with the Pulaski acquisition in 2016, the Company acquired similar statutory trusts maintained by Pulaski and the fair value adjustment is being accreted over the weighted average remaining life. The Company had $71.3 million and $71.2 million of junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated trusts at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the allowance for loan losses by loan categories and percentage of loans to total loans as of December 31 for each of the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nOperating Results (dollars in thousands)\nThe following table shows activity affecting the allowance for loan losses (dollars in thousands):\nLoans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management's opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory guidelines. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\n\nAsset Quality\nIncome Taxes\nProfessional fees of $11.1 million in 2019 increased by $5.7 million as compared to $5.4 million in 2018. Professional fees were influenced by acquisition expenses and other restructuring costs as well as Company initiatives.\nNet cash provided by investing activities totaled $65.0 million in 2019 compared to $55.4 million used in investing activities in 2018. Significant items affecting cash flows from investing activities are those activities associated with managing the Company's investment and loan portfolios and cash received/paid in acquisitions. The Company experienced a net increase in loans of $244.3 million in 2019 compared to $49.9 million in 2018, excluding acquired loans.\nDebt securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Debt securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Equity securities are carried at fair value. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value and amortized cost of debt securities available for sale were $1.6 billion. There were $22.0 million of gross unrealized gains and $0.8 million of gross unrealized losses for a net unrealized loss of $21.2 million. The net unrealized loss, net of tax, is recorded in stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any debt securities held to maturity. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of equity securities was $6.0 million.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate levels and volume fluctuations within earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income. Net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets.\nJunior Subordinated Debt Owed to Unconsolidated Trusts\nThe following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\n\nborrowings, long-term debt, payment of dividends and proceeds and redemption from stock issuances. Deposits, which represent the Company's primary funding source, increased by $215.6 million in 2019 compared to an increase of $123.6 million in 2018, excluding acquired deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $30.9 million in 2019 compared to $118.8 million in 2018.\nRevenues from trust fees, commissions and brokers' fees, and remittance processing activities represented 46.0% of the Company's non-interest income in 2019, providing a balance to spread-based revenue from traditional banking activities. Further, non-interest income, excluding net security losses, represented 28.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTotal average interest-bearing liability balances increased $1.2 billion, or 22.3%, to $6.4 billion in 2019 as compared to $5.2 billion in 2018. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $254.7 million, or 17.1%, to $1.7 billion in 2019, as compared to $1.5 billion in 2018. Average non-interest bearing deposits represented 22.8% of total average deposits in 2019. The Company remains strongly core deposit funded with total average deposits in 2019 representing 92.9% of total average liabilities, with solid liquidity and significant market share in the communities we serve.\nOn January 29, 2019, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement providing for a $60.0 million term loan (the Term Loan\u201d) with a maturity date of November 30, 2023. The Term Loan has an annual interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.50%. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to fund the cash consideration related to the acquisition of Banc Ed. The Company had $54.0 million outstanding indebtedness on December 31, 2019, comprised of $6.0 million of short-term borrowings and $48.0 million of long-term debt. The Term Loan is redeemable by the Company at its option at any time prior to maturity.\nThe Company reviews new accounting standards as issued.
