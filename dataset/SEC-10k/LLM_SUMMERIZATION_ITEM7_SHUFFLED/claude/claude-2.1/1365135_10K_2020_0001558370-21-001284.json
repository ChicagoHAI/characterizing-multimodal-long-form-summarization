Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of money movement and payment services, operating in two business segments:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Consumer-to-Consumer - Our Consumer-to-Consumer operating segment facilitates money transfers, which are sent from our retail agent locations worldwide or through websites and mobile devices, including our fast-growing money transfer transactions conducted and funded through websites and mobile applications marketed under our brands ( westernunion.com\u201d) and transactions initiated on the internet and mobile applications hosted by our third-party white label or co-branded digital partners (together with westernunion.com, Digital Money Transfer\u201d). Our money transfer service is provided through one interconnected global network. This service is available for international cross-border transfers and, in certain countries, intra-country transfers. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Business Solutions - Our Business Solutions operating segment facilitates payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals. The majority of the segment's business relates to exchanges of currency at spot rates, which enable customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, in certain countries, we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll businesses and other services that have not been classified in the above segments are reported as Other, which primarily includes our bill payment services which facilitate payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations and our money order services. Our other services, in addition to certain corporate costs such as costs related to strategic initiatives, including costs for the review and closing of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, are also included in Other. Additional information on our segments is further described in the Segment Discussion below.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. For discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020.\nThe results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Income. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our segments have been eliminated. The below information has been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) unless otherwise noted. All amounts provided in this section are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, the percentage changes and margins disclosed herein may not recalculate precisely using the rounded amounts provided.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak associated with a novel coronavirus a pandemic ( COVID-19\u201d), and governments throughout the world instituted various actions such as lockdowns, stay-at-home orders,\ntravel restrictions, and closures of non-essential businesses in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These actions negatively impacted our ability to offer our services, at least temporarily, through a portion of our locations and our retail agent locations during the year ended December 31, 2020. Beginning in March 2020 and continuing throughout the remainder of the year, we experienced a decrease in transaction volumes from retail locations and a decrease in foreign exchange and payment services activity, which also negatively impacted revenues during this period, partially offset by revenue growth from westernunion.com and other digital transactions, as further described below. We believe this decrease is mainly due to economic decline and uncertainty resulting from the pandemic.\nOur revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, resulted in a reduction to revenues of $157.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year. Included within this amount are impacts related to the strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso, which resulted in a reduction to revenues of $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies negatively impacted operating income by $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year. Included within this amount are impacts related to the strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso, which resulted in a reduction to operating income of $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year.\nOn February 28, 2019, we entered into an agreement with ACI Worldwide Corp. and ACW Worldwide, Inc. to sell our United States based electronic bill payments business known as Speedpay\u201d, which had been included as a component of Other in our segment reporting. We received approximately $750 million and recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $523 million in the all-cash transaction that closed on May 9, 2019. Speedpay revenues and direct operating expenses included in our results were $125.4 million and $98.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,835.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,292.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,826.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,086.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general, and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,041.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,271.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,867.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,358.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 967.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 934.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income/(expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on divestitures of businesses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 524.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (118.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (152.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income/(expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (112.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 387.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 855.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,321.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 263.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 744.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,058.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 412.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 427.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 415.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 430.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>Calculation not meaningful. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues Overview\nRevenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers to transfer money. These revenues vary by transaction based upon factors such as channel, send and receive locations, the principal amount sent, whether the money transfer involves different send and receive currencies, the difference between the exchange rate we set to the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market, and speed of service, as applicable. We also offer several other services, including foreign exchange and payment services and other bill payment services, for which revenue is impacted by similar factors.\nDue to the significance of the effect that foreign exchange fluctuations against the United States dollar can have on our reported revenues, constant currency results have been provided in the table below for consolidated revenues. We have also disclosed the impact of divestitures on our revenues in the table below. Additionally, due to the significance of our Consumer-to-Consumer segment to our overall results, we have also provided constant currency results for our Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenues. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the United States dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. Constant currency measures and measures that exclude the impact of divestitures are non-GAAP financial measures and are provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and divestitures of our businesses, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. We believe that these measures provide management and investors with information about revenue results and trends that eliminates currency volatility and divestitures, thereby providing greater clarity regarding, and increasing the comparability of, our underlying results and trends. These disclosures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated revenue results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues, as reported - (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,835.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,292.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency impact (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divestitures impact (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue change, constant currency adjusted and excluding divestitures - (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, resulted in a reduction to revenues of $157.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to foreign currency rates in the prior year.

( Paymap\u201d), which we sold in May 2019, provides electronic mortgage bill payment services, and related revenues included in our results were $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, GAAP revenues decreased when compared to the prior year, including as a result of the impacts from the worldwide actions related to COVID-19. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced a decrease in transaction volumes from retail locations in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, which was offset by growth in digital transactions, including from white label partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2020, GAAP revenues also decreased when compared to the prior year due to fluctuations between the United States dollar and other currencies and the divestitures of the Speedpay and Paymap businesses during the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in revenues constant currency adjusted and excluding divestitures (Non-GAAP) was primarily the result of the impacts from the worldwide actions related to COVID-19, as discussed above.\nOperating Expenses Overview\nEnhanced Regulatory Compliance\nThe financial services industry, including money services businesses, continues to be subject to increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements, and we continue to focus on and regularly review our compliance programs. In connection with these reviews, and in light of growing and rapidly evolving regulatory complexity and heightened attention of, and increased dialogue with, governmental and regulatory authorities related to our compliance activities, we have made, and continue to make, enhancements to our processes and systems designed to detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud and other illicit activity, and enhancements designed to improve consumer protection. Some of these changes have had, and we believe will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRestructuring-Related Expenses\nOn August 1, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a plan to change our operating model and improve our business processes and cost structure by reorganizing our senior management, including those managers reporting to our chief executive officer, reducing our headcount, and consolidating various facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $36.8 million related to this plan. Of this amount, $4.5 million and $32.3 million are included within Cost of services and Selling, general, and administrative, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $115.5 million of expenses related to this plan, of which $39.8 million and $75.7 million are included within Cost of services and Selling, general, and administrative, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4, Restructuring-Related Expenses for further discussion. As of December 31, 2020, all expenses associated with this plan have been incurred and substantially all have been and will continue to be paid in cash. The plan generated expense savings of more than $50 million in 2020 and we expect to generate approximately $100 million of expense savings in 2021, which is our estimate and subject to change.\nThese expenses are specific to this initiative; however, the types of expenses related to this initiative are similar to expenses that we have previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future.\nCost of Services\nCost of services primarily consists of agent commissions, which represented approximately 60% of total cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of services decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year due to a decrease in agent commissions in our Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business, which generally vary with revenues, including due to fluctuations between the United States dollar and foreign currencies, the Speedpay divestiture during the second quarter of 2019, a decrease in employee-related expenses, including as a result of reduced hiring, and a decrease in restructuring-related expenses, partially offset by an increase in credit losses.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year due to a decrease in employee-related expenses, including incentive compensation and as a result of savings from our restructuring plan, and a decrease in restructuring-related expenses. Certain of these reductions in employee-related expenses are a result of delayed hiring and a reduction in travel, which are partially due to COVID-19 and not expected to reoccur. In addition, Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased due to a decrease in marketing costs and costs related to strategic initiatives, including for the review and closing of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. These decreases were partially offset by the strengthening of the United States dollar against certain foreign currencies.\nTotal Other Income/(Expense), Net\nTotal other income/(expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by the non-recurring gain on the sale of our United States based electronic bill payments business known as Speedpay. In addition, total other income/(expense), net benefitted from a reduction in interest expense driven by a lower weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding debt during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rates on pre-tax income were 12.9% and 19.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher prior period domestic pre-tax income associated with the sales of the Speedpay and Paymap businesses, prior period settlements in certain geographies, and discrete tax benefits in the current period.\nWe have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of tax contingency reserves was $310.5 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. Our tax reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include: (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes in facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue during the period, and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows.\nA significant proportion of our profits are foreign-derived. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 100% and 67%, respectively, of our pre-tax income was derived from foreign sources. While the income tax imposed by any one foreign country is not material to us, our overall effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in foreign tax laws.\nEarnings Per Share\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, basic earnings per share were $1.81 and $2.47, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.79 and $2.46, respectively. Outstanding options to purchase Western Union stock and unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 1.6 million and 1.9 million, respectively, of shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method, primarily due to outstanding restricted stock units and options to purchase shares of Western Union stock, as the assumed proceeds of the restricted stock and options per unit were above our weighted-average share price during the periods and their effect was anti-dilutive.\nEarnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was impacted by the previously described factors impacting net income and a lower number of shares outstanding. Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by the gain on the sale of Speedpay in the second quarter of 2019. The lower number of shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year is due to stock repurchases exceeding stock issuances related to our stock compensation programs.\nSegment Discussion\nWe manage our business around the consumers and businesses we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups, distribution networks, and services offered. Our segments are Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions.\nThe business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, our Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) are computed in accordance with the following principles:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Corporate costs, including stock-based compensation and other overhead, are allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments' revenue compared to total revenue. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>As described in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4, Restructuring-Related Expenses on August 1, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an overall plan to change our operating model and improve our business processes and cost structure by reducing our headcount and consolidating various facilities. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred $36.8 million and $115.5 million, respectively, related to this plan. While certain of these expenses may be identifiable to our segments, primarily our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, the expenses are not included in the measurement of segment operating income provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>All items not included in operating income are excluded from the segments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth the components of segment revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer-to-Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we changed our expense allocation method so that our corporate data center and network engineering information technology expenses are allocated based on a percentage of relative revenue. In 2019, these costs had been allocated based in part on a percentage of relative transactions. We believe that an allocation method based fully on relative revenue presents a more representative view of segment profitability, as certain of our services, particularly some of our bill payment services and our money order services, have much lower revenues per transaction than our other services. Further, these technology expenses are becoming increasingly based on data storage utilized and less based on the number of transactions processed. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this change would have decreased Consumer-to-Consumer operating income and increased Other operating income by $49.6 million. Business Solutions was not materially impacted by the change in the allocation method.\nConsumer-to-Consumer Segment\nThe following table sets forth our Consumer-to-Consumer segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars and transactions in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,220.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,407.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 924.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 975.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key indicator:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer-to-Consumer transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 290.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 289.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer service facilitates money transfers sent from our retail agent locations worldwide and our Digital Money Transfer services. The segment includes five geographic regions whose functions are primarily related to generating, managing, and maintaining agent relationships and localized marketing activities. We include Digital Money Transfer transactions in our regions, including transactions from our arrangements with financial institutions and other third parties, to enable such entities to offer money transfer services to their own customers under their brands. By means of common processes and systems, these regions, including Digital Money Transfer transactions, create one interconnected global network for consumer transactions, thereby constituting one Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business and one operating segment.\nTransaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment. A Consumer-to-Consumer transaction constitutes the transfer of funds to a designated recipient utilizing one of our consumer money transfer services. The geographic split for transactions and revenue in the table that follows, including Digital Money Transfer transactions, is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated. Included in each region's transaction and revenue percentages in the tables below are Digital Money Transfer transactions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Where reported separately in the discussion below, Digital Money Transfer, and its subset westernunion.com, consist of 100% of the transactions conducted and funded through those respective channels.\nThe table below sets forth revenue and transaction changes by geographic region compared to the prior year. Consumer-to-Consumer segment constant currency revenue growth/(decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure, as further discussed in Revenues Overview above.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Growth/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Decline), as\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Growth/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Transaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Reported -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Translation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decline) (a) -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Growth/\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decline)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer-to-Consumer regional growth/(decline):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America (United States & Canada) (\"NA\")\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Russia/CIS (\"EU & CIS\")\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (\"MEASA\")\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America and the Caribbean (\"LACA\") (b)\n</td> <td>(22)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(11)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(11)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(20)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East Asia and Oceania (\"APAC\")\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(10)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Consumer-to-Consumer growth/(decline):\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital Money Transfer (c)\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>westernunion.com (c)\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>Constant currency revenue growth assumes that revenues denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the United States dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td>(b) </td> <td>Our LACA region results were impacted by the strengthening of the United States dollar against the Argentine peso, in addition to an increase in local currency revenue per transaction, primarily due to inflation. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td>(c) </td> <td>Digital Money Transfer revenues have been included in the regions above.

The increase in principal and cross-border principal transferred during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year is attributable to growth in Digital Money Transfer. Consumer-to-Consumer principal is the amount of consumer funds transferred to the designated recipient. Cross-border principal is the amount of consumer funds transferred to a designated recipient in a country or territory that differs from the country or territory from which the transaction was initiated. Consumer-to-Consumer principal and cross-border principal are metrics used by management to monitor and better understand the growth in our underlying business relative to competitors, as well as changes in our market share of global remittances.\nRevenues\nConsumer-to-Consumer money transfer revenue decreased 4% and transactions were flat for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, including as a result of the impacts from the worldwide actions related to COVID-19. Revenues were impacted by a decrease in transaction volumes from retail locations, which were offset by growth in digital transactions, including from white label partnerships. The spread between transaction volumes and revenue decline was primarily attributable to growth in our digital white label partnerships, which have a lower revenue per transaction than Western Union branded transactions. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, negatively impacted revenue by 1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Constant currency revenue decreased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRevenues compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by COVID-19, which caused governments around the world to institute various protective measures in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. These measures, which include lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and closures of non-essential businesses, negatively impacted our ability to offer services, at least temporarily, through some of our retail agent locations across all of our regions. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures also resulted in a decline in economic activity that negatively impacted our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decline was caused by decreases in transactions from our retail business and was partially offset by growth in Digital Money Transfer transactions, including transactions initiated through westernunion.com. We believe that our growth in Digital Money Transfer transactions was due, in part, to shifts in consumer behavior to send money through digital channels, including as a result of COVID-19. The significant majority of agent locations that had been closed as a result of COVID-19 have resumed offering our services as of December 31, 2020, although certain of our retail locations remain closed.\nRevenues for all Consumer-to-Consumer regions compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in NA revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily the result of declines in money transfers sent and received in the United States. The decrease in EU & CIS and MEASA revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was driven by transaction declines in retail money transfers, partially offset by transaction growth from digital white label partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in LACA revenue, which generates a higher proportion of revenues from retail locations compared to our other regions, was primarily due to transaction declines caused by continued COVID-19-related government protective measures, including agent location closures in the region. For the year ended December 31, 2020, westernunion.com revenues, which have been included in the regions as described above, were negatively impacted by net price reductions.\nConsumer-to-Consumer revenues in 2021 could be negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19. The duration and severity of the pandemic as well as the responses of government authorities to the pandemic, the macro economic consequences, and the impacts on consumer behavior are uncertain. We expect that our results will continue to be adversely impacted as long as such factors persist.\nWe have historically implemented price reductions or price increases throughout many of our global corridors. We will likely continue to implement price changes from time to time in response to competition and other factors. Price reductions generally reduce margins and adversely affect financial results in the short term and may also adversely affect financial results in the long term if transaction volumes do not increase sufficiently. Price increases may adversely affect transaction volumes, as consumers may not use our services if we fail to price them appropriately.\nOperating Income\nConsumer-to-Consumer operating income decreased 5% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues, increased allocations of certain information technology expenses, as previously discussed, an increase in credit losses, and the strengthening of the United States dollar against certain foreign currencies, partially offset by decreases in employee-related expenses, as described above, including incentive compensation and as a result of reduced hiring and savings from our restructuring plan, as well as decreases in marketing costs. Certain of these reductions in employee-related expenses are a result of delayed hiring and a reduction in travel, which are partially due to COVID-19 and not expected to reoccur.\nBusiness Solutions\nThe following table sets forth our Business Solutions segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 356.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 388.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 24.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nBusiness Solutions revenue decreased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decline in payment services activity, generally across all geographic regions. We believe this decrease was due to a downturn in economic conditions and trade, which primarily resulted from the effects of COVID-19. We expect that to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or the related macro-economic consequences continue, we could continue to experience declines in cross-currency payments and reductions to segment revenues in future periods.\nOperating Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Business Solutions operating income and operating income margin decreased when compared to the prior year due to the impact of revenue declines, as discussed above, and costs associated with the termination of a property lease in the United States, partially offset by a reduction in employee-related expenses.\nOther\nOther primarily consists of our cash-based bill payments businesses in Argentina and the United States, in addition to our money order services. As previously described, we entered into an agreement on February 28, 2019 to sell Speedpay and closed the transaction on May 9, 2019. Speedpay revenues and direct operating expenses included in our results were $125.4 million and $98.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn May 6, 2019, we completed the sale of Paymap for contingent consideration and immaterial cash proceeds received at closing. Paymap revenues and direct operating expenses included in our results were $5.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth Other results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 258.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 495.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 55.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 27.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>Calculation not meaningful. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nOther revenue decreased 48% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the sale of Speedpay in the second quarter of 2019 and declines in revenues from our cash-based bill payments services offered at retail locations, including as a result of the strengthening of the United States dollar against the Argentine peso, partially offset by an increase in local currency revenue per transaction, primarily due to inflation.\nWe believe that Other revenues could continue to be negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19 to the extent the pandemic or the related macro-economic consequences continue, as we may continue to experience decreases in our cash-based bill payments services.\nOperating Income\nOther operating income increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year due to the change in allocated information technology expenses, as previously discussed, and a decrease in costs related to strategic initiatives, including for the review and closing of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, partially offset by a decrease in revenues, net of a reduction in direct expenses from the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures, and a decrease in revenues from our cash-based bill payments services.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of payments for employee and agent incentives, interest payments on our outstanding borrowings and timing of income tax payments, among other items. Many of our annual employee incentive compensation and agent incentive payments are made in the first quarter following the year they were incurred. The majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters. The annual payments resulting from the United States tax reform legislation enacted in 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d) include amounts related to the United States taxation of certain previously undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. These payments are typically due in the second quarter of each year through 2025.\nOur future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting migrant populations and including as a result of COVID-19 related impacts, changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits, including the resolution of outstanding tax matters, and the settlement or resolution of legal contingencies. The duration and severity of COVID-19 and related impacts are uncertain, but we believe we are taking appropriate measures to attempt to address liquidity-related considerations by evaluating, monitoring, and assessing the creditworthiness and credit risk ratings of our agents and customers.\nSubstantially all of our cash flows from operating activities have been generated from subsidiaries. Most of these cash flows are generated from our regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use, except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions, including: (i) requirements to maintain cash and other qualifying investment balances, free of any liens or other encumbrances, related to the payment of certain of our money transfer and other payment obligations, (ii) other legal or regulatory restrictions, including statutory\nor formalized minimum net worth requirements, and (iii) restrictions on transferring assets outside of the countries where these assets are located. See also Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, Business and Basis of Presentation.\nAssuming that our operations are not significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic for a protracted period, we currently believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs, including payments under our debt and other obligations, through our existing cash balances, our ability to generate cash flows through operations, and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which expires in January 2025 and supports our commercial paper program. Our commercial paper program enables us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of any borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility and $80.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the commercial paper program.\nTo help ensure availability of our worldwide cash where needed, we utilize a variety of planning and financial strategies, including decisions related to the amounts, timing, and manner by which cash is made available from our international subsidiaries. These decisions can influence our overall tax rate and impact our total liquidity. We regularly evaluate, taking tax consequences and other factors into consideration, our United States cash requirements and also the potential uses of cash internationally to determine the appropriate level of dividend repatriations of our foreign source income.\nCash and Investment Securities\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,428.2 million and $1,450.5 million, respectively. In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of those transactions. These funds, referred to as Settlement assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments, classified as Cash and cash equivalents within Settlement assets, to fund settlement obligations.\nInvestment securities, classified within Settlement assets, were $1,990.6 million and $1,698.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and consist primarily of highly-rated state and municipal debt securities, including fixed-rate term notes and variable-rate demand notes. The substantial majority of our investment securities are held in order to comply with state licensing requirements in the United States and are required to have credit ratings of A-\u201d or better from a major credit rating agency.\nInvestment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly-rated securities and diversifying our investment portfolio. Our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration. As of December 31, 2020, all investments with a single issuer and each individual security represented less than 10% of our investment securities portfolio.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $877.5 million and $914.6 million, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities can be impacted by changes to our consolidated net income, in addition to fluctuations in our working capital balances, among other factors.\nFinancing Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had the following outstanding borrowings (in millions):\nTable 144: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 80.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.600% notes due 2022 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.250% notes due 2023 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.850% notes due 2025 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.200% notes due 2036 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.200% notes due 2040 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 250.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan facility borrowing (effective rate of 1.4%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 950.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowings at par value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,080.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs and unamortized discount, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.8)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowings at carrying value (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,067.2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>The difference between the stated interest rate and the effective interest rate is not significant. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td>(b) </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020, our weighted-average effective rate on total borrowings was approximately 3.5%. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommercial Paper Program\nPursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $80.0 million and $245.0 million in commercial paper borrowings outstanding, respectively. Our commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2020 had a weighted-average annual interest rate of approximately 0.3% and a weighted-average term of approximately 5 days. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average commercial paper balance outstanding was $181.6 million and $193.6 million, respectively, and the maximum balance outstanding was $690.0 million and $630.0 million, respectively. Proceeds from our commercial paper borrowings were used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn December 18, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of $1.5 billion, including a $250.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. On December 18, 2019, we extended the final maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to January 8, 2025.\nInterest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of 110 basis points. A facility fee of 15 basis points is also payable quarterly on the total facility, regardless of usage. Both the interest rate margin and facility fee percentage are based on certain of our credit ratings.\nThe purpose of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is diversified through a group of 19 participating institutions, is to provide general liquidity and to support our commercial paper program, which we believe enhances our short-term credit rating. The largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of $1.5 billion is approximately 11%. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. If the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility decreased, or if the Revolving Credit Facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn December 18, 2018, we extended the Term Loan Facility providing for an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $950.0 million. In October 2016, we borrowed $575.0 million under our prior term loan facility. In December 2018, we borrowed the remaining amount available under the Term Loan Facility.\nGenerally, interest under the Term Loan Facility is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of 125 basis points. The interest rate margin percentage is based on certain of our credit ratings and will increase or decrease in the event of certain upgrades or downgrades in our credit ratings.\nIn addition to the payment of interest, we are required to make certain periodic amortization payments with respect to the outstanding principal of the term loan, beginning in 2021. The final maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is January 8, 2024.\nNotes\nOn November 25, 2019, we issued $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due January 10, 2025 ( 2025 Notes\u201d). We used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Notes to redeem our 2020 Notes, as defined below, and for general corporate purposes. Interest with respect to the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 10 and July 10 of each year, beginning on July 10, 2020, based on the per annum rate of 2.850%. The interest rate payable on the 2025 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to these notes is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on the 2025 Notes exceed 4.850% per annum. The interest rate payable on the 2025 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below 2.850% per annum. We may redeem the 2025 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to December 10, 2024 at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points. We may redeem the 2025 Notes at any time after December 10, 2024 at a price equal to par, plus accrued interest.\nOn June 11, 2018, we issued $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 9, 2023 ( 2023 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 9 and December 9 of each year, beginning on December 9, 2018, based on the per annum rate of 4.250%. The interest rate payable on the 2023 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to these notes is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on the 2023 Notes exceed 6.250% per annum. The interest rate payable on the 2023 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below 4.250% per annum. We may redeem the 2023 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 9, 2023 at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 25 basis points. We may redeem the 2023 Notes at any time after May 9, 2023 at a price equal to par, plus accrued interest.\nOn August 22, 2017, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due May 22, 2019 ( Floating Rate Notes\u201d). The Floating Rate Notes were repaid in May 2019 using proceeds from the Speedpay divestiture, commercial paper, and cash, including cash generated from operations.\nOn March 15, 2017, we issued $400.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due March 15, 2022. On August 22, 2017, we issued an additional $100.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due March 15, 2022, for an aggregate principal total of $500.0 million of 3.600% unsecured notes ( 2022 Notes\u201d). The notes issued on August 22, 2017 are part of the same series and, accordingly, have the same terms and conditions as the notes issued on March 15, 2017; however, the notes issued on August 22, 2017 were issued at a premium of 101.783% and we received $1.57 million of accrued interest upon issuance. Interest with respect to the 2022 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2017, based on the per annum rate of 3.600%. The interest rate payable on the 2022 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to the note is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on the 2022 Notes exceed 5.600% per annum. The interest rate payable on the 2022 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below 3.600% per annum. We may redeem the 2022 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2022 at the greater of par or a price based on the\napplicable treasury rate plus 25 basis points. We may redeem the 2022 Notes at any time after February 15, 2022 at a price equal to par, plus accrued interest.\nOn November 22, 2013, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due May 22, 2019 ( 2019 Notes\u201d). The 2019 Notes were repaid in May 2019 using proceeds from the Speedpay divestiture, commercial paper, and cash, including cash generated from operations.\nOn June 21, 2010, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 21, 2040 ( 2040 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2040 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 21 and December 21 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2040 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 30 basis points.\nOn March 30, 2010, we exchanged $303.7 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due November 17, 2011 for unsecured notes due April 1, 2020 ( 2020 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2020 Notes was payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of 5.253%. In connection with the exchange, note holders were given a 7% premium ($21.2 million), which approximated market value at the exchange date, as additional principal. As this transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, this premium was not charged to expense. Rather, the premium, along with the offsetting hedge accounting adjustments, was accreted into Interest expense over the life of the notes. On November 18, 2019, we announced a cash tender offer on our outstanding 2020 Notes. On November 25, 2019, we purchased the principal amount of $56.1 million, plus accrued interest, pursuant to the tender offer. On December 27, 2019, we redeemed the remaining principal amount of $268.8 million, plus accrued interest. The total premium paid to redeem the 2020 Notes was $3.1 million.\nOn November 17, 2006, we issued $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due November 17, 2036 ( 2036 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2036 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 17 and November 17 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 25 basis points.\nCredit Ratings and Debt Covenants\nThe credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in our overall business, managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings, cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity, and the overall business.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and our Term Loan Facility contain interest rate margins which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings, and our Revolving Credit Facility also contains a facility fee that is based on our credit ratings. In addition, the interest rates payable on our 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2025 Notes can be impacted by our credit ratings. We are also subject to certain provisions in many of our notes and certain of our derivative contracts, which could require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade, as further described below. We do not have any other terms within our debt agreements that are tied to changes in our credit ratings.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer assets or merge or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness, or use proceeds in violation of anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws. Our notes are subject to similar covenants except that only the 2036 Notes contain covenants limiting or restricting subsidiary indebtedness and none of our notes are subject to a covenant that limits our ability to impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends. Our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility require us to maintain a consolidated adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio of greater than 3:1 (ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income/(loss) plus the sum of (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation expense, (iv) amortization expense, (v) any other non-cash deductions, losses or charges made in determining net income/(loss) for such period, and (vi) extraordinary, non-recurring, or unusual losses or charges (including costs and expenses of litigation included in operating income), minus extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual gains provided that the amount added back\nto net income (or net loss) for such extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges may not exceed 10% of adjusted EBITDA, in each case determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for such period, to interest expense) for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 11:1 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes.\nCertain of our notes (including the 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes, and 2040 Notes) include a change of control triggering event provision, as defined in the terms of the notes. If a change of control triggering event occurs, holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of their notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of their notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. A change of control triggering event will occur when there is a change of control involving us and among other things, within a specified period in relation to the change of control, the notes are downgraded from an investment grade rating to below an investment grade rating by certain major credit rating agencies.\nCash Priorities\nLiquidity\nOur objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital structure consistent with investment-grade credit ratings. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities, access to the commercial paper markets, and our Revolving Credit Facility available to support the needs of our business.\nOur ability to grow the business, make investments in our business, make acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, including through dividends and share repurchases, and service our debt and tax obligations will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify acquisitions that align with our long-term strategy. For additional information, please refer to Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nInvestment in Saudi Digital Payments Company\nOn November 21, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire an ownership interest in Saudi Digital Payments Company ( stc pay\u201d), a subsidiary of Saudi Telecom Company and one of our Consumer-to-Consumer digital white label partners. Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction is intended to occur in two tranches. In the first tranche, we agreed to invest approximately $133 million for a 10% investment in stc pay, and, in the second tranche, we agreed to invest an additional approximately $67 million for an additional 5% investment in stc pay. The first tranche is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021 and the closing of the second tranche is contingent upon stc pay satisfying certain conditions.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe total aggregate amount paid for contract costs, purchases of property and equipment, and purchased and developed software was $156.8 million and $127.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amounts paid for new and renewed agent contracts vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed contract signings. Other capital expenditures during these periods included investments in our information technology infrastructure and purchased and developed software.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 8.5 million and 26.9 million shares, respectively, have been repurchased for $217.4 million and $540.0 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at an average cost of $25.45 and $20.07, respectively. During the first quarter of 2020, we temporarily paused and did not resume share repurchases under\na publicly announced authorization through December 31, 2020. However, we have resumed share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2020, $782.6 million remains available under the share repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors through December 31, 2021.\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.225 per common share in all four quarters of 2020, representing $369.9 million in total dividends. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.20 per common share in all four quarters of 2019, representing $340.8 million in total dividends. These amounts were paid to shareholders of record in the respective quarter the dividend was declared.\nOn February 10, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.235 per common share payable on March 31, 2021.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nDebt Service Requirements\nOur 2021 and future debt service requirements will include payments on all outstanding indebtedness, including any borrowings under our commercial paper program. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial and Supplemental Data, Note 16, Borrowings for details on our outstanding borrowings, including future principal payments on our notes, term loan, and commercial paper. As of December 31, 2020, the total projected interest payments on our borrowings were $960.9 million, of which $104.5 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. We have estimated our future interest payments based on the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our notes. However, we may refinance all or a portion of our borrowings in future periods. Estimated interest payments on floating-rate debt are calculated by utilizing the effective rate and forward rates as of December 31, 2020 for our current and future interest rates, respectively.\n2017 United States Federal Tax Liability\nThe Tax Act imposed a tax on certain of our previously undistributed foreign earnings. This tax charge, combined with our other 2017 United States taxable income and tax attributes, resulted in a 2017 United States federal tax liability of approximately $800 million, of which approximately $604 million remained as of December 31, 2020. We have elected to pay this liability in periodic installments through 2025. Under the terms of the law, we owe 8% of the original liability in both 2021 and 2022, with 15%, 20%, and 25% of the tax owed in 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we made installment payments of $64.0 million. These payments have affected and will continue to adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity and may adversely affect future share repurchases.\nOperating Leases\nWe lease real properties for use as administrative and sales offices, in addition to transportation, office, and other equipment. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, Note 13, Leases for details on our leasing arrangements, including future maturities of our operating lease liabilities.\nForeign Currency Derivative Contracts\nWe use derivatives to minimize our exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which fluctuate based on market conditions. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, Note 15, Derivatives. The substantial majority of these derivative contracts relate to our Business Solutions segment, which facilitates cross-currency payments by writing derivatives to customers, and a significant majority of these Business Solutions derivative contracts have a duration at inception of less than one year.\nPurchase Obligations\nA purchase obligation is an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding, and specifies all significant terms. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $170 million of outstanding purchase obligations, of which approximately $120 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. Many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice and with a termination penalty. Termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation. Obligations under certain contracts are usage-based and are, therefore, estimated in the above amounts. Historically, we have not had any significant defaults on our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations.\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nPension Plan\nWe have a frozen defined benefit pension plan (the Plan\u201d), for which the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the plan assets was $280.6 million, which exceeded the projected benefit obligation of $240.7 million and resulted in prepaid pension costs of $39.9 million. As of December 31, 2019, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets, which resulted in an unfunded pension obligation of $11.4 million. We were not required to and did not make a contribution to the Plan in 2020 and 2019, and we are not required to make any contributions to the Plan in 2021.\nOur most recent measurement date for our pension plan was December 31, 2020. The calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost is dependent upon three primary assumptions: (i) expected long-term return on plan assets, (ii) discount rate, and (iii) life expectancy trends.\nGiven the overfunded status of the Plan, we are in the process of moving towards a full allocation of fixed income investments to more closely match the Plan's assets to its liabilities. The expected long-term return on plan assets is 2.00% for 2021. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset and liability studies.\nThe discount rate assumption is based on the rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled and is determined by matching the timing and balance of anticipated payouts under the Plan to the rates from an AA spot rate yield curve, which is derived from AA bonds of varying maturities. The discount rate assumption for our benefit obligation was 1.66% and 2.66% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 100 basis point change to both the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact to our annual pension expense.\nThe assumptions related to life expectancy are used to estimate the expected period over which pension benefits will be required to be paid. Projections used for life expectancy are based on mortality tables and mortality improvement tables, which are statistical tables of expected annual mortality rates and expected future mortality improvements, respectively. We utilize a mortality table that we believe best aligns with the underlying demographics and census data of the Plan participants.\nOther Commercial Commitments\nWe had approximately $390 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of December 31, 2020 primarily held in connection with safeguarding consumer funds, lease arrangements, and certain agent agreements. The significant majority of our letters of credit and bank guarantees have a one-year renewal option, and we expect to renew prior to expiration in most circumstances.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates, described below, are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and our results of operations and applying them requires our management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments. We believe that the understanding of these key accounting policies and estimates is essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe after applying the required analyses and judgments.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes requires significant judgment. We routinely receive, and may in the future receive, questions from taxing authorities on various tax-related assertions. In many of these instances, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain, given the complexities in interpreting tax laws and applying our facts and circumstances to these laws in many jurisdictions throughout the world.\nIncome Tax Contingencies\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\nWe have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. Our tax reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include: (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes in facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue during the period and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the consolidated financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period.\nOur tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 were $310.5 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differs from our estimates, we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Furthermore, the timing of related cash payments for these tax liabilities is inherently uncertain and is affected by variable factors outside our control.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivatives to: (i) minimize our exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, periodically, interest rates and (ii) facilitate cross-currency Business Solutions payments by writing derivatives to customers. We recognize all derivatives in Other assets and Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception, and others are not designated as accounting hedges.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Cash flow hedges - Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted revenues, as well as hedges of the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in Accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCL\u201d) are reclassified to earnings in the same period the hedged item affects earnings when the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Fair value hedges - Fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed-rate debt, through interest rate swaps. The changes in fair value of these hedges, along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, are recorded in Interest expense. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements. The details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, and how effectiveness is being assessed. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis. If the hedge is no longer deemed effective, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship on a prospective basis.\nWe have foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are designated as cash flow hedges. If these hedges no longer qualify under hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of these derivatives would be reflected into earnings, which could have a significant impact on our reported results. As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative pre-tax unrealized loss currently classified within AOCL that would be reflected in earnings if these hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was $22.9 million.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed, arising from business combinations. An impairment assessment of goodwill is conducted annually during our fourth quarter at the reporting unit level. This assessment of goodwill is performed more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Reporting units are determined by the level at which management reviews segment operating results. In some cases, that level is the operating segment and in others it is one level below the operating segment.\nOur impairment assessment typically begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The initial qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results. Additionally, each reporting unit's fair value is assessed under certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity-specific events. Periodically, we perform a quantitative assessment, as described below, for each of our reporting units, regardless of the results of prior qualitative assessments.\nIf we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows and compare the estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then an impairment is recognized for the difference. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further discussion regarding our accounting policies for goodwill and any related impairments.\nThe determination of the reporting units and which reporting units to include in the qualitative assessment requires significant judgment. Also, all of the assumptions used in the qualitative assessment require judgment. Additionally, for the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we calculate the fair value of reporting units through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including, among other items, revenue growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans. Development of such estimates and assumptions and the resultant fair value takes into consideration expected regulatory, marketplace, and other economic factors as well as relevant discount rates and terminal values.\nWe could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change. If an event described above occurs and causes us to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, it would impact our reported earnings in the period such charge occurs.\nThe carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2020 was $2,566.6 million which represented approximately 27% of our consolidated assets. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill of $1,980.7 million and $532.0 million resides in our Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions reporting units, respectively, while the remaining $53.9 million resides in Other. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not record any goodwill impairments. For the reporting units that comprise Consumer-to-Consumer and Other, the fair values of the businesses significantly exceed their carrying amounts.\nThe fair value of the Business Solutions reporting unit continues to be sensitive to changes in projections for revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins. Our current expectation is for Business Solutions to average low to mid-single digit annual revenue growth over the 10-year forecast period, with EBITDA margins dependent on revenue growth. Our ability to achieve the projected revenue growth and EBITDA margins may be affected by, amongst other factors: (i) pricing and product competition from direct competitors, banks and new market entrants; (ii) our success and speed to market in developing new products; (iii) the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the United States dollar; (iv) increased regulatory compliance requirements; (v) our ability to enter relationships with partners that can accelerate our time to market; (vi) failure of long-term import growth rates returning to historic levels, including as a result of COVID-19; (vii) our ability to continue to maintain our payment network and bank account infrastructure; (viii) foreign currency volatility impacts on customer activity; and (ix) continued opportunities for cost reduction. Based on assumptions used within the Business Solutions reporting unit valuation, we believe an approximate 100 basis point decrease in the ten-year compound annual growth rate of revenue (also reflecting the assumed impact such a reduction would have on EBITDA margins) would result in a reduction in the fair value of the Business Solutions reporting unit of approximately $175 million. Such a reduction would result in the fair value approximating the carrying value of the reporting unit.\nOther Intangible Assets\nWe capitalize acquired intangible assets as well as certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts and software. We evaluate such intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets or operations are compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write-down to fair value (normally measured by the present value technique) is required.\nThe capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the amount to capitalize and the related period of benefit. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given agent contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract. Additionally, the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with each asset requires us to make estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, revenue growth rates and operating margins based on our budgets and business plans.\nDisruptions to contractual relationships, significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with contracts, or other issues significantly impacting the future cash flows associated with the contract would cause us to evaluate the recoverability of the asset and could result in an impairment charge. The net carrying value of our other intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 was $505.0 million. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded immaterial impairments related to other intangible assets.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are subject to certain claims and litigation that could result in losses, including damages, fines, and/or civil penalties, which could be significant, and in some cases, criminal charges. We regularly evaluate the status of legal matters\nto assess whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable in determining whether an accrual is appropriate. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. When a potential loss is considered probable and the reasonable estimate is a range, we accrue on the low end of the range when no amount is a better estimate than any other amount.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining whether a loss is probable and whether the loss can be reasonably estimated, including determining a loss value within a range. Our judgments are subjective and are based on considerations such as the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultations with in-house and outside legal counsel. As the outcome of claims and litigation is uncertain, accruals are based on the best information available at the time the judgment is made. As additional information becomes available, which may include information we learn through the discovery process, settlement discussions, or rulings by courts, arbitrators or others, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.\nIn determining whether disclosure is appropriate, we evaluate each legal matter to assess if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss or additional material losses may have been incurred beyond those amounts which we have already accrued. If such a reasonable possibility exists, we include an estimate of possible loss or range of loss in our disclosure of reasonably possible potential litigation losses or we state if such an estimate of possible loss or range of loss cannot be made.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, and to the varied range of potential outcomes, the actual outcomes may differ materially from our judgments.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion.", "item_7_truncated": "A significant proportion of our profits are foreign-derived. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 100% and 67%, respectively, of our pre-tax income was derived from foreign sources. While the income tax imposed by any one foreign country is not material to us, our overall effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in foreign tax laws.\nThe following table sets forth the components of segment revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer assets or merge or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness, or use proceeds in violation of anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws. Our notes are subject to similar covenants except that only the 2036 Notes contain covenants limiting or restricting subsidiary indebtedness and none of our notes are subject to a covenant that limits our ability to impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends.

Interest with respect to the 2020 Notes was payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of 5.253%. In connection with the exchange, note holders were given a 7% premium ($21.2 million), which approximated market value at the exchange date, as additional principal. As this transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, this premium was not charged to expense. Rather, the premium, along with the offsetting hedge accounting adjustments, was accreted into Interest expense over the life of the notes. On November 18, 2019, we announced a cash tender offer on our outstanding 2020 Notes. On November 25, 2019, we purchased the principal amount of $56.1 million, plus accrued interest, pursuant to the tender offer. On December 27, 2019, we redeemed the remaining principal amount of $268.8 million, plus accrued interest. The total premium paid to redeem the 2020 Notes was $3.1 million.\nAssuming that our operations are not significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic for a protracted period, we currently believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs, including payments under our debt and other obligations, through our existing cash balances, our ability to generate cash flows through operations, and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which expires in January 2025 and supports our commercial paper program. Our commercial paper program enables us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of any borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility and $80.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the commercial paper program.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Growth/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Decline), as\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Growth/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Transaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Reported -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Translation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decline) (a) -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Growth/\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decline)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer-to-Consumer regional growth/(decline):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America (United States & Canada) (\"NA\")\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Russia/CIS (\"EU & CIS\")\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (\"MEASA\")\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America and the Caribbean (\"LACA\") (b)\n</td> <td>(22)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(11)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(11)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(20)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East Asia and Oceania (\"APAC\")\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(10)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Consumer-to-Consumer growth/(decline):\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital Money Transfer (c)\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>westernunion.com (c)\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 25, 2019, we issued $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due January 10, 2025 ( 2025 Notes\u201d). We used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Notes to redeem our 2020 Notes, as defined below, and for general corporate purposes. Interest with respect to the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 10 and July 10 of each year, beginning on July 10, 2020, based on the per annum rate of 2.850%. The interest rate payable on the 2025 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to these notes is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on the 2025 Notes exceed 4.850% per annum. The interest rate payable on the 2025 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below 2.850% per annum. We may redeem the 2025 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to December 10, 2024 at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points. We may redeem the 2025 Notes at any time after December 10, 2024 at a price equal to par, plus accrued interest.\n \u25cf Cash flow hedges - Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted revenues, as well as hedges of the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in Accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCL\u201d) are reclassified to earnings in the same period the hedged item affects earnings when the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. \nEarnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was impacted by the previously described factors impacting net income and a lower number of shares outstanding. Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by the gain on the sale of Speedpay in the second quarter of 2019. The lower number of shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year is due to stock repurchases exceeding stock issuances related to our stock compensation programs.\nOther primarily consists of our cash-based bill payments businesses in Argentina and the United States, in addition to our money order services. As previously described, we entered into an agreement on February 28, 2019 to sell Speedpay and closed the transaction on May 9, 2019. Speedpay revenues and direct operating expenses included in our results were $125.4 million and $98.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn August 22, 2017, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due May 22, 2019 ( Floating Rate Notes\u201d). The Floating Rate Notes were repaid in May 2019 using proceeds from the Speedpay divestiture, commercial paper, and cash, including cash generated from operations.\nRevenues compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by COVID-19, which caused governments around the world to institute various protective measures in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. These measures, which include lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and closures of non-essential businesses, negatively impacted our ability to offer services, at least temporarily, through some of our retail agent locations across all of our regions. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures also resulted in a decline in economic activity that negatively impacted our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decline was caused by decreases in transactions from our retail business and was partially offset by growth in Digital Money Transfer transactions, including transactions initiated through westernunion.com. We believe that our growth in Digital Money Transfer transactions was due, in part, to shifts in consumer behavior to send money through digital channels, including as a result of COVID-19. The significant majority of agent locations that had been closed as a result of COVID-19 have resumed offering our services as of December 31, 2020, although certain of our retail locations remain closed.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer-to-Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Leases\nOn February 10, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.235 per common share payable on March 31, 2021.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 80.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.600% notes due 2022 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.250% notes due 2023 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.850% notes due 2025 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.200% notes due 2036 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.200% notes due 2040 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 250.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan facility borrowing (effective rate of 1.4%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 950.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowings at par value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,080.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs and unamortized discount, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.8)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowings at carrying value (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,067.2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Paymap revenues and direct operating expenses included in our results were $5.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe have historically implemented price reductions or price increases throughout many of our global corridors. We will likely continue to implement price changes from time to time in response to competition and other factors. Price reductions generally reduce margins and adversely affect financial results in the short term and may also adversely affect financial results in the long term if transaction volumes do not increase sufficiently. Price increases may adversely affect transaction volumes, as consumers may not use our services if we fail to price them appropriately.\nOther operating income increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year due to the change in allocated information technology expenses, as previously discussed, and a decrease in costs related to strategic initiatives, including for the review and closing of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, partially offset by a decrease in revenues, net of a reduction in direct expenses from the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures, and a decrease in revenues from our cash-based bill payments services.\n \u25cf As described in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4, Restructuring-Related Expenses on August 1, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an overall plan to change our operating model and improve our business processes and cost structure by reducing our headcount and consolidating various facilities. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred $36.8 million and $115.5 million, respectively, related to this plan. While certain of these expenses may be identifiable to our segments, primarily our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, the expenses are not included in the measurement of segment operating income provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. \nPursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $80.0 million and $245.0 million in commercial paper borrowings outstanding, respectively. Our commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2020 had a weighted-average annual interest rate of approximately 0.3% and a weighted-average term of approximately 5 days. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average commercial paper balance outstanding was $181.6 million and $193.6 million, respectively, and the maximum balance outstanding was $690.0 million and $630.0 million, respectively. Proceeds from our commercial paper borrowings were used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs.\nFinancing Resources\nOur Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer service facilitates money transfers sent from our retail agent locations worldwide and our Digital Money Transfer services. The segment includes five geographic regions whose functions are primarily related to generating, managing, and maintaining agent relationships and localized marketing activities. We include Digital Money Transfer transactions in our regions, including transactions from our arrangements with financial institutions and other third parties, to enable such entities to offer money transfer services to their own customers under their brands. By means of common processes and systems, these regions, including Digital Money Transfer transactions, create one interconnected global network for consumer transactions, thereby constituting one Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business and one operating segment.\nThe following table sets forth our Business Solutions segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe following table sets forth Other results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nCapital Expenditures\nDebt Service Requirements\nDue to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, and to the varied range of potential outcomes, the actual outcomes may differ materially from our judgments.\nThe business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, our Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) are computed in accordance with the following principles:\nRevenues\nA purchase obligation is an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding, and specifies all significant terms. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $170 million of outstanding purchase obligations, of which approximately $120 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. Many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice and with a termination penalty. Termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation. Obligations under certain contracts are usage-based and are, therefore, estimated in the above amounts. Historically, we have not had any significant defaults on our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have a frozen defined benefit pension plan (the Plan\u201d), for which the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the plan assets was $280.6 million, which exceeded the projected benefit obligation of $240.7 million and resulted in prepaid pension costs of $39.9 million. As of December 31, 2019, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets, which resulted in an unfunded pension obligation of $11.4 million. We were not required to and did not make a contribution to the Plan in 2020 and 2019, and we are not required to make any contributions to the Plan in 2021.\nWe have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. Our tax reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include: (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes in facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue during the period and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the consolidated financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period.\nRevenues Overview\nOther Intangible Assets\nIn addition to the payment of interest, we are required to make certain periodic amortization payments with respect to the outstanding principal of the term loan, beginning in 2021. The final maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is January 8, 2024.\nOperating Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Business Solutions operating income and operating income margin decreased when compared to the prior year due to the impact of revenue declines, as discussed above, and costs associated with the termination of a property lease in the United States, partially offset by a reduction in employee-related expenses.\nIncome Taxes\n\n\n (a) Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, resulted in a reduction to revenues of $157.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to foreign currency rates in the prior year. Included within this amount are impacts related to the strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso, which resulted in a reduction to revenues of $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to foreign currency rates in the prior year. \nConsumer-to-Consumer money transfer revenue decreased 4% and transactions were flat for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, including as a result of the impacts from the worldwide actions related to COVID-19. Revenues were impacted by a decrease in transaction volumes from retail locations, which were offset by growth in digital transactions, including from white label partnerships. The spread between transaction volumes and revenue decline was primarily attributable to growth in our digital white label partnerships, which have a lower revenue per transaction than Western Union branded transactions. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, negatively impacted revenue by 1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Constant currency revenue decreased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLegal Contingencies\n \u25cf Consumer-to-Consumer - Our Consumer-to-Consumer operating segment facilitates money transfers, which are sent from our retail agent locations worldwide or through websites and mobile devices, including our fast-growing money transfer transactions conducted and funded through websites and mobile applications marketed under our brands ( westernunion.com\u201d) and transactions initiated on the internet and mobile applications hosted by our third-party white label or co-branded digital partners (together with westernunion.com, Digital Money Transfer\u201d). Our money transfer service is provided through one interconnected global network. This service is available for international cross-border transfers and, in certain countries, intra-country transfers. \nAs of December 31, 2020, we had the following outstanding borrowings (in millions):\nGoodwill\nIncome Taxes\n (a) Constant currency revenue growth assumes that revenues denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the United States dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. \nWe use derivatives to minimize our exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which fluctuate based on market conditions. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, Note 15, Derivatives. The substantial majority of these derivative contracts relate to our Business Solutions segment, which facilitates cross-currency payments by writing derivatives to customers, and a significant majority of these Business Solutions derivative contracts have a duration at inception of less than one year.\nor formalized minimum net worth requirements, and (iii) restrictions on transferring assets outside of the countries where these assets are located. See also Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, Business and Basis of Presentation.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n \u25cf Corporate costs, including stock-based compensation and other overhead, are allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments' revenue compared to total revenue. \nSubstantially all of our cash flows from operating activities have been generated from subsidiaries. Most of these cash flows are generated from our regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use, except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions, including: (i) requirements to maintain cash and other qualifying investment balances, free of any liens or other encumbrances, related to the payment of certain of our money transfer and other payment obligations, (ii) other legal or regulatory restrictions, including statutory\n\nCredit Ratings and Debt Covenants\nOn June 11, 2018, we issued $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 9, 2023 ( 2023 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 9 and December 9 of each year, beginning on December 9, 2018, based on the per annum rate of 4.250%. The interest rate payable on the 2023 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to these notes is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on the 2023 Notes exceed 6.250% per annum. The interest rate payable on the 2023 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below 4.250% per annum. We may redeem the 2023 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 9, 2023 at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 25 basis points. We may redeem the 2023 Notes at any time after May 9, 2023 at a price equal to par, plus accrued interest.\nOur impairment assessment typically begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The initial qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results. Additionally, each reporting unit's fair value is assessed under certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity-specific events. Periodically, we perform a quantitative assessment, as described below, for each of our reporting units, regardless of the results of prior qualitative assessments.\nOn March 15, 2017, we issued $400.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due March 15, 2022. On August 22, 2017, we issued an additional $100.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due March 15, 2022, for an aggregate principal total of $500.0 million of 3.600% unsecured notes ( 2022 Notes\u201d). The notes issued on August 22, 2017 are part of the same series and, accordingly, have the same terms and conditions as the notes issued on March 15, 2017; however, the notes issued on August 22, 2017 were issued at a premium of 101.783% and we received $1.57 million of accrued interest upon issuance. Interest with respect to the 2022 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2017, based on the per annum rate of 3.600%. The interest rate payable on the 2022 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to the note is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on the 2022 Notes exceed 5.600% per annum. The interest rate payable on the 2022 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below 3.600% per annum. We may redeem the 2022 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2022 at the greater of par or a price based on the\nOther\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\n\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur ability to grow the business, make investments in our business, make acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, including through dividends and share repurchases, and service our debt and tax obligations will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify acquisitions that align with our long-term strategy. For additional information, please refer to Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nOn June 21, 2010, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 21, 2040 ( 2040 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2040 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 21 and December 21 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2040 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 30 basis points.\n (a) Calculation not meaningful. \nTotal Other Income/(Expense), Net\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, basic earnings per share were $1.81 and $2.47, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.79 and $2.46, respectively. Outstanding options to purchase Western Union stock and unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 1.6 million and 1.9 million, respectively, of shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method, primarily due to outstanding restricted stock units and options to purchase shares of Western Union stock, as the assumed proceeds of the restricted stock and options per unit were above our weighted-average share price during the periods and their effect was anti-dilutive.\nOur 2021 and future debt service requirements will include payments on all outstanding indebtedness, including any borrowings under our commercial paper program. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial and Supplemental Data, Note 16, Borrowings for details on our outstanding borrowings, including future principal payments on our notes, term loan, and commercial paper. As of December 31, 2020, the total projected interest payments on our borrowings were $960.9 million, of which $104.5 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. We have estimated our future interest payments based on the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our notes. However, we may refinance all or a portion of our borrowings in future periods. Estimated interest payments on floating-rate debt are calculated by utilizing the effective rate and forward rates as of December 31, 2020 for our current and future interest rates, respectively.\n (a) Calculation not meaningful. \n (b) Our LACA region results were impacted by the strengthening of the United States dollar against the Argentine peso, in addition to an increase in local currency revenue per transaction, primarily due to inflation. \nto assess whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable in determining whether an accrual is appropriate. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. When a potential loss is considered probable and the reasonable estimate is a range, we accrue on the low end of the range when no amount is a better estimate than any other amount.\nConsumer-to-Consumer revenues in 2021 could be negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19. The duration and severity of the pandemic as well as the responses of government authorities to the pandemic, the macro economic consequences, and the impacts on consumer behavior are uncertain. We expect that our results will continue to be adversely impacted as long as such factors persist.\nOur objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital structure consistent with investment-grade credit ratings. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities, access to the commercial paper markets, and our Revolving Credit Facility available to support the needs of our business.\nWe are a leading provider of money movement and payment services, operating in two business segments:\nTotal other income/(expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by the non-recurring gain on the sale of our United States based electronic bill payments business known as Speedpay. In addition, total other income/(expense), net benefitted from a reduction in interest expense driven by a lower weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding debt during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.\nThe accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements. The details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, and how effectiveness is being assessed. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis. If the hedge is no longer deemed effective, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship on a prospective basis.\nConsumer-to-Consumer Segment\n\nRestructuring-Related Expenses\nCash Priorities\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and our Term Loan Facility contain interest rate margins which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings, and our Revolving Credit Facility also contains a facility fee that is based on our credit ratings. In addition, the interest rates payable on our 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2025 Notes can be impacted by our credit ratings. We are also subject to certain provisions in many of our notes and certain of our derivative contracts, which could require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade, as further described below. We do not have any other terms within our debt agreements that are tied to changes in our credit ratings.\nLiquidity\nRevenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers to transfer money. These revenues vary by transaction based upon factors such as channel, send and receive locations, the principal amount sent, whether the money transfer involves different send and receive currencies, the difference between the exchange rate we set to the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market, and speed of service, as applicable. We also offer several other services, including foreign exchange and payment services and other bill payment services, for which revenue is impacted by similar factors.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $877.5 million and $914.6 million, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities can be impacted by changes to our consolidated net income, in addition to fluctuations in our working capital balances, among other factors.\nIn determining whether disclosure is appropriate, we evaluate each legal matter to assess if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss or additional material losses may have been incurred beyond those amounts which we have already accrued. If such a reasonable possibility exists, we include an estimate of possible loss or range of loss in our disclosure of reasonably possible potential litigation losses or we state if such an estimate of possible loss or range of loss cannot be made.\n \u25cf All items not included in operating income are excluded from the segments. \nOperating Income\nOn February 28, 2019, we entered into an agreement with ACI Worldwide Corp. and ACW Worldwide, Inc. to sell our United States based electronic bill payments business known as Speedpay\u201d, which had been included as a component of Other in our segment reporting. We received approximately $750 million and recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $523 million in the all-cash transaction that closed on May 9, 2019. Speedpay revenues and direct operating expenses included in our results were $125.4 million and $98.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\ntravel restrictions, and closures of non-essential businesses in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These actions negatively impacted our ability to offer our services, at least temporarily, through a portion of our locations and our retail agent locations during the year ended December 31, 2020. Beginning in March 2020 and continuing throughout the remainder of the year, we experienced a decrease in transaction volumes from retail locations and a decrease in foreign exchange and payment services activity, which also negatively impacted revenues during this period, partially offset by revenue growth from westernunion.com and other digital transactions, as further described below. We believe this decrease is mainly due to economic decline and uncertainty resulting from the pandemic.\nDisruptions to contractual relationships, significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with contracts, or other issues significantly impacting the future cash flows associated with the contract would cause us to evaluate the recoverability of the asset and could result in an impairment charge. The net carrying value of our other intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 was $505.0 million. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded immaterial impairments related to other intangible assets.\n\n (c) Digital Money Transfer revenues have been included in the regions above. As noted above, westernunion.com is a subset of Digital Money Transfer and is included in the regions and Digital Money Transfer revenues. \nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.225 per common share in all four quarters of 2020, representing $369.9 million in total dividends. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.20 per common share in all four quarters of 2019, representing $340.8 million in total dividends. These amounts were paid to shareholders of record in the respective quarter the dividend was declared.\n2017 United States Federal Tax Liability\nNotes\nResults of Operations\na publicly announced authorization through December 31, 2020. However, we have resumed share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2020, $782.6 million remains available under the share repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors through December 31, 2021.\nWe could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change. If an event described above occurs and causes us to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, it would impact our reported earnings in the period such charge occurs.\nOur tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 were $310.5 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differs from our estimates, we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Furthermore, the timing of related cash payments for these tax liabilities is inherently uncertain and is affected by variable factors outside our control.\nEnhanced Regulatory Compliance\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year due to a decrease in employee-related expenses, including incentive compensation and as a result of savings from our restructuring plan, and a decrease in restructuring-related expenses. Certain of these reductions in employee-related expenses are a result of delayed hiring and a reduction in travel, which are partially due to COVID-19 and not expected to reoccur. In addition, Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased due to a decrease in marketing costs and costs related to strategic initiatives, including for the review and closing of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. These decreases were partially offset by the strengthening of the United States dollar against certain foreign currencies.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nInvestment securities, classified within Settlement assets, were $1,990.6 million and $1,698.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and consist primarily of highly-rated state and municipal debt securities, including fixed-rate term notes and variable-rate demand notes. The substantial majority of our investment securities are held in order to comply with state licensing requirements in the United States and are required to have credit ratings of A-\u201d or better from a major credit rating agency.\nThe following table sets forth our Consumer-to-Consumer segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, resulted in a reduction to revenues of $157.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year. Included within this amount are impacts related to the strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso, which resulted in a reduction to revenues of $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies negatively impacted operating income by $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year. Included within this amount are impacts related to the strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso, which resulted in a reduction to operating income of $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year.\nThe following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. For discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020.\nThe results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Income. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our segments have been eliminated. The below information has been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) unless otherwise noted. All amounts provided in this section are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, the percentage changes and margins disclosed herein may not recalculate precisely using the rounded amounts provided.\nOperating Income\nGiven the overfunded status of the Plan, we are in the process of moving towards a full allocation of fixed income investments to more closely match the Plan's assets to its liabilities. The expected long-term return on plan assets is 2.00% for 2021. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset and liability studies.\nOur future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting migrant populations and including as a result of COVID-19 related impacts, changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits, including the resolution of outstanding tax matters, and the settlement or resolution of legal contingencies. The duration and severity of COVID-19 and related impacts are uncertain, but we believe we are taking appropriate measures to attempt to address liquidity-related considerations by evaluating, monitoring, and assessing the creditworthiness and credit risk ratings of our agents and customers.\nOn November 21, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire an ownership interest in Saudi Digital Payments Company ( stc pay\u201d), a subsidiary of Saudi Telecom Company and one of our Consumer-to-Consumer digital white label partners. Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction is intended to occur in two tranches. In the first tranche, we agreed to invest approximately $133 million for a 10% investment in stc pay, and, in the second tranche, we agreed to invest an additional approximately $67 million for an additional 5% investment in stc pay. The first tranche is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021 and the closing of the second tranche is contingent upon stc pay satisfying certain conditions.\nWe have foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are designated as cash flow hedges. If these hedges no longer qualify under hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of these derivatives would be reflected into earnings, which could have a significant impact on our reported results. As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative pre-tax unrealized loss currently classified within AOCL that would be reflected in earnings if these hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was $22.9 million.\nSegment Discussion\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCash and Investment Securities\nThe fair value of the Business Solutions reporting unit continues to be sensitive to changes in projections for revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins. Our current expectation is for Business Solutions to average low to mid-single digit annual revenue growth over the 10-year forecast period, with EBITDA margins dependent on revenue growth. Our ability to achieve the projected revenue growth and EBITDA margins may be affected by, amongst other factors: (i) pricing and product competition from direct competitors, banks and new market entrants; (ii) our success and speed to market in developing new products; (iii) the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the United States dollar; (iv) increased regulatory compliance requirements; (v) our ability to enter relationships with partners that can accelerate our time to market; (vi) failure of long-term import growth rates returning to historic levels, including as a result of COVID-19; (vii) our ability to continue to maintain our payment network and bank account infrastructure; (viii) foreign currency volatility impacts on customer activity; and (ix) continued opportunities for cost reduction. Based on assumptions used within the Business Solutions reporting unit valuation, we believe an approximate 100 basis point decrease in the ten-year compound annual growth rate of revenue (also reflecting the assumed impact such a reduction would have on EBITDA margins) would result in a reduction in the fair value of the Business Solutions reporting unit of approximately $175 million. Such a reduction would result in the fair value approximating the carrying value of the reporting unit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes.\n (b) In May 2019, we sold a substantial majority of our United States based electronic bill payments services. Speedpay revenues included in our results were $125.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Paymap Inc. ( Paymap\u201d), which we sold in May 2019, provides electronic mortgage bill payment services, and related revenues included in our results were $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. \nOur critical accounting policies and estimates, described below, are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and our results of operations and applying them requires our management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments. We believe that the understanding of these key accounting policies and estimates is essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition.\nOn November 17, 2006, we issued $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due November 17, 2036 ( 2036 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2036 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 17 and November 17 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 25 basis points.\nWe capitalize acquired intangible assets as well as certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts and software. We evaluate such intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets or operations are compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write-down to fair value (normally measured by the present value technique) is required.\nOperating Expenses Overview\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe table below sets forth regional revenues as a percentage of our Consumer-to-Consumer revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOn November 22, 2013, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due May 22, 2019 ( 2019 Notes\u201d). The 2019 Notes were repaid in May 2019 using proceeds from the Speedpay divestiture, commercial paper, and cash, including cash generated from operations.\nIf we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows and compare the estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then an impairment is recognized for the difference. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further discussion regarding our accounting policies for goodwill and any related impairments.\nAll businesses and other services that have not been classified in the above segments are reported as Other, which primarily includes our bill payment services which facilitate payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations and our money order services. Our other services, in addition to certain corporate costs such as costs related to strategic initiatives, including costs for the review and closing of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, are also included in Other. Additional information on our segments is further described in the Segment Discussion below.\nGenerally, interest under the Term Loan Facility is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of 125 basis points. The interest rate margin percentage is based on certain of our credit ratings and will increase or decrease in the event of certain upgrades or downgrades in our credit ratings.\nThe assumptions related to life expectancy are used to estimate the expected period over which pension benefits will be required to be paid. Projections used for life expectancy are based on mortality tables and mortality improvement tables, which are statistical tables of expected annual mortality rates and expected future mortality improvements, respectively. We utilize a mortality table that we believe best aligns with the underlying demographics and census data of the Plan participants.\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion.\nThe purpose of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is diversified through a group of 19 participating institutions, is to provide general liquidity and to support our commercial paper program, which we believe enhances our short-term credit rating. The largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of $1.5 billion is approximately 11%. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. If the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility decreased, or if the Revolving Credit Facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted.\nIncome taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe after applying the required analyses and judgments.\nWe had approximately $390 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of December 31, 2020 primarily held in connection with safeguarding consumer funds, lease arrangements, and certain agent agreements. The significant majority of our letters of credit and bank guarantees have a one-year renewal option, and we expect to renew prior to expiration in most circumstances.\nInterest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of 110 basis points. A facility fee of 15 basis points is also payable quarterly on the total facility, regardless of usage. Both the interest rate margin and facility fee percentage are based on certain of our credit ratings.\n\nDue to the significance of the effect that foreign exchange fluctuations against the United States dollar can have on our reported revenues, constant currency results have been provided in the table below for consolidated revenues. We have also disclosed the impact of divestitures on our revenues in the table below. Additionally, due to the significance of our Consumer-to-Consumer segment to our overall results, we have also provided constant currency results for our Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenues. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the United States dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. Constant currency measures and measures that exclude the impact of divestitures are non-GAAP financial measures and are provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and divestitures of our businesses, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. We believe that these measures provide management and investors with information about revenue results and trends that eliminates currency volatility and divestitures, thereby providing greater clarity regarding, and increasing the comparability of, our underlying results and trends. These disclosures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.\nOn August 1, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a plan to change our operating model and improve our business processes and cost structure by reorganizing our senior management, including those managers reporting to our chief executive officer, reducing our headcount, and consolidating various facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $36.8 million related to this plan. Of this amount, $4.5 million and $32.3 million are included within Cost of services and Selling, general, and administrative, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $115.5 million of expenses related to this plan, of which $39.8 million and $75.7 million are included within Cost of services and Selling, general, and administrative, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4, Restructuring-Related Expenses for further discussion. As of December 31, 2020, all expenses associated with this plan have been incurred and substantially all have been and will continue to be paid in cash. The plan generated expense savings of more than $50 million in 2020 and we expect to generate approximately $100 million of expense savings in 2021, which is our estimate and subject to change.\nCost of services primarily consists of agent commissions, which represented approximately 60% of total cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of services decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year due to a decrease in agent commissions in our Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business, which generally vary with revenues, including due to fluctuations between the United States dollar and foreign currencies, the Speedpay divestiture during the second quarter of 2019, a decrease in employee-related expenses, including as a result of reduced hiring, and a decrease in restructuring-related expenses, partially offset by an increase in credit losses.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated revenue results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOther Commercial Commitments\nBusiness Solutions revenue decreased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decline in payment services activity, generally across all geographic regions. We believe this decrease was due to a downturn in economic conditions and trade, which primarily resulted from the effects of COVID-19. We expect that to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or the related macro-economic consequences continue, we could continue to experience declines in cross-currency payments and reductions to segment revenues in future periods.\nConsumer-to-Consumer operating income decreased 5% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues, increased allocations of certain information technology expenses, as previously discussed, an increase in credit losses, and the strengthening of the United States dollar against certain foreign currencies, partially offset by decreases in employee-related expenses, as described above, including incentive compensation and as a result of reduced hiring and savings from our restructuring plan, as well as decreases in marketing costs. Certain of these reductions in employee-related expenses are a result of delayed hiring and a reduction in travel, which are partially due to COVID-19 and not expected to reoccur.\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nto net income (or net loss) for such extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges may not exceed 10% of adjusted EBITDA, in each case determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for such period, to interest expense) for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 11:1 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther revenue decreased 48% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the sale of Speedpay in the second quarter of 2019 and declines in revenues from our cash-based bill payments services offered at retail locations, including as a result of the strengthening of the United States dollar against the Argentine peso, partially offset by an increase in local currency revenue per transaction, primarily due to inflation.\nWe use derivatives to: (i) minimize our exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, periodically, interest rates and (ii) facilitate cross-currency Business Solutions payments by writing derivatives to customers. We recognize all derivatives in Other assets and Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception, and others are not designated as accounting hedges.\nForeign Currency Derivative Contracts\nCertain of our notes (including the 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes, and 2040 Notes) include a change of control triggering event provision, as defined in the terms of the notes. If a change of control triggering event occurs, holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of their notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of their notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. A change of control triggering event will occur when there is a change of control involving us and among other things, within a specified period in relation to the change of control, the notes are downgraded from an investment grade rating to below an investment grade rating by certain major credit rating agencies.\n (a) The difference between the stated interest rate and the effective interest rate is not significant. \nOur effective tax rates on pre-tax income were 12.9% and 19.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher prior period domestic pre-tax income associated with the sales of the Speedpay and Paymap businesses, prior period settlements in certain geographies, and discrete tax benefits in the current period.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\nPension Plan\nRevenues for all Consumer-to-Consumer regions compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in NA revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily the result of declines in money transfers sent and received in the United States. The decrease in EU & CIS and MEASA revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was driven by transaction declines in retail money transfers, partially offset by transaction growth from digital white label partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in LACA revenue, which generates a higher proportion of revenues from retail locations compared to our other regions, was primarily due to transaction declines caused by continued COVID-19-related government protective measures, including agent location closures in the region. For the year ended December 31, 2020, westernunion.com revenues, which have been included in the regions as described above, were negatively impacted by net price reductions.\nWe are subject to certain claims and litigation that could result in losses, including damages, fines, and/or civil penalties, which could be significant, and in some cases, criminal charges. We regularly evaluate the status of legal matters\nTo help ensure availability of our worldwide cash where needed, we utilize a variety of planning and financial strategies, including decisions related to the amounts, timing, and manner by which cash is made available from our international subsidiaries. These decisions can influence our overall tax rate and impact our total liquidity. We regularly evaluate, taking tax consequences and other factors into consideration, our United States cash requirements and also the potential uses of cash internationally to determine the appropriate level of dividend repatriations of our foreign source income.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining whether a loss is probable and whether the loss can be reasonably estimated, including determining a loss value within a range. Our judgments are subjective and are based on considerations such as the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultations with in-house and outside legal counsel. As the outcome of claims and litigation is uncertain, accruals are based on the best information available at the time the judgment is made. As additional information becomes available, which may include information we learn through the discovery process, settlement discussions, or rulings by courts, arbitrators or others, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.\nCost of Services\nThe Tax Act imposed a tax on certain of our previously undistributed foreign earnings. This tax charge, combined with our other 2017 United States taxable income and tax attributes, resulted in a 2017 United States federal tax liability of approximately $800 million, of which approximately $604 million remained as of December 31, 2020. We have elected to pay this liability in periodic installments through 2025. Under the terms of the law, we owe 8% of the original liability in both 2021 and 2022, with 15%, 20%, and 25% of the tax owed in 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we made installment payments of $64.0 million. These payments have affected and will continue to adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity and may adversely affect future share repurchases.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we changed our expense allocation method so that our corporate data center and network engineering information technology expenses are allocated based on a percentage of relative revenue. In 2019, these costs had been allocated based in part on a percentage of relative transactions. We believe that an allocation method based fully on relative revenue presents a more representative view of segment profitability, as certain of our services, particularly some of our bill payment services and our money order services, have much lower revenues per transaction than our other services. Further, these technology expenses are becoming increasingly based on data storage utilized and less based on the number of transactions processed. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this change would have decreased Consumer-to-Consumer operating income and increased Other operating income by $49.6 million. Business Solutions was not materially impacted by the change in the allocation method.\n \u25cf Fair value hedges - Fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed-rate debt, through interest rate swaps. The changes in fair value of these hedges, along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, are recorded in Interest expense. \nThe discount rate assumption is based on the rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled and is determined by matching the timing and balance of anticipated payouts under the Plan to the rates from an AA spot rate yield curve, which is derived from AA bonds of varying maturities. The discount rate assumption for our benefit obligation was 1.66% and 2.66% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 100 basis point change to both the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact to our annual pension expense.\nPurchase Obligations\nOur consumers transferred $96.1 billion and $87.7 billion in Consumer-to-Consumer principal for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, of which $90.6 billion and $80.7 billion, respectively, related to cross-border principal. The increase in principal and cross-border principal transferred during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year is attributable to growth in Digital Money Transfer. Consumer-to-Consumer principal is the amount of consumer funds transferred to the designated recipient. Cross-border principal is the amount of consumer funds transferred to a designated recipient in a country or territory that differs from the country or territory from which the transaction was initiated. Consumer-to-Consumer principal and cross-border principal are metrics used by management to monitor and better understand the growth in our underlying business relative to competitors, as well as changes in our market share of global remittances.\nWe lease real properties for use as administrative and sales offices, in addition to transportation, office, and other equipment. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, Note 13, Leases for details on our leasing arrangements, including future maturities of our operating lease liabilities.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n \u25cf Business Solutions - Our Business Solutions operating segment facilitates payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals. The majority of the segment's business relates to exchanges of currency at spot rates, which enable customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, in certain countries, we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments. \nOur primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of payments for employee and agent incentives, interest payments on our outstanding borrowings and timing of income tax payments, among other items. Many of our annual employee incentive compensation and agent incentive payments are made in the first quarter following the year they were incurred. The majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters. The annual payments resulting from the United States tax reform legislation enacted in 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d) include amounts related to the United States taxation of certain previously undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. These payments are typically due in the second quarter of each year through 2025.\nIncome Tax Contingencies\nDerivative Financial Instruments\napplicable treasury rate plus 25 basis points. We may redeem the 2022 Notes at any time after February 15, 2022 at a price equal to par, plus accrued interest.\nRevenues\nThe capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the amount to capitalize and the related period of benefit. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given agent contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract. Additionally, the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with each asset requires us to make estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, revenue growth rates and operating margins based on our budgets and business plans.\nInvestment in Saudi Digital Payments Company\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed, arising from business combinations. An impairment assessment of goodwill is conducted annually during our fourth quarter at the reporting unit level. This assessment of goodwill is performed more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Reporting units are determined by the level at which management reviews segment operating results. In some cases, that level is the operating segment and in others it is one level below the operating segment.\nThe credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in our overall business, managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings, cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity, and the overall business.\nThe determination of the reporting units and which reporting units to include in the qualitative assessment requires significant judgment. Also, all of the assumptions used in the qualitative assessment require judgment. Additionally, for the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we calculate the fair value of reporting units through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including, among other items, revenue growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans. Development of such estimates and assumptions and the resultant fair value takes into consideration expected regulatory, marketplace, and other economic factors as well as relevant discount rates and terminal values.\nTerm Loan Facility\nDigital Money Transfer, which is included in the regional percentages above, represented approximately 20% and 14% of our Consumer-to-Consumer revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn December 18, 2018, we extended the Term Loan Facility providing for an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $950.0 million. In October 2016, we borrowed $575.0 million under our prior term loan facility. In December 2018, we borrowed the remaining amount available under the Term Loan Facility.\nThe total aggregate amount paid for contract costs, purchases of property and equipment, and purchased and developed software was $156.8 million and $127.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amounts paid for new and renewed agent contracts vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed contract signings. Other capital expenditures during these periods included investments in our information technology infrastructure and purchased and developed software.\nThe table below sets forth revenue and transaction changes by geographic region compared to the prior year. Consumer-to-Consumer segment constant currency revenue growth/(decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure, as further discussed in Revenues Overview above.\nThese expenses are specific to this initiative; however, the types of expenses related to this initiative are similar to expenses that we have previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future.\nWe have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of tax contingency reserves was $310.5 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. Our tax reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include: (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes in facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue during the period, and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows.\nOn December 18, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of $1.5 billion, including a $250.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. On December 18, 2019, we extended the final maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to January 8, 2025.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe financial services industry, including money services businesses, continues to be subject to increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements, and we continue to focus on and regularly review our compliance programs. In connection with these reviews, and in light of growing and rapidly evolving regulatory complexity and heightened attention of, and increased dialogue with, governmental and regulatory authorities related to our compliance activities, we have made, and continue to make, enhancements to our processes and systems designed to detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud and other illicit activity, and enhancements designed to improve consumer protection. Some of these changes have had, and we believe will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nRevenues\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak associated with a novel coronavirus a pandemic ( COVID-19\u201d), and governments throughout the world instituted various actions such as lockdowns, stay-at-home orders,\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 8.5 million and 26.9 million shares, respectively, have been repurchased for $217.4 million and $540.0 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at an average cost of $25.45 and $20.07, respectively. During the first quarter of 2020, we temporarily paused and did not resume share repurchases under\nWe believe that Other revenues could continue to be negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19 to the extent the pandemic or the related macro-economic consequences continue, as we may continue to experience decreases in our cash-based bill payments services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, GAAP revenues decreased when compared to the prior year, including as a result of the impacts from the worldwide actions related to COVID-19. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced a decrease in transaction volumes from retail locations in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, which was offset by growth in digital transactions, including from white label partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2020, GAAP revenues also decreased when compared to the prior year due to fluctuations between the United States dollar and other currencies and the divestitures of the Speedpay and Paymap businesses during the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in revenues constant currency adjusted and excluding divestitures (Non-GAAP) was primarily the result of the impacts from the worldwide actions related to COVID-19, as discussed above.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,428.2 million and $1,450.5 million, respectively. In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of those transactions. These funds, referred to as Settlement assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments, classified as Cash and cash equivalents within Settlement assets, to fund settlement obligations.\nOverview", "item_7_text": "A significant proportion of our profits are foreign-derived. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 100% and 67%, respectively, of our pre-tax income was derived from foreign sources. While the income tax imposed by any one foreign country is not material to us, our overall effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in foreign tax laws.\nThe following table sets forth the components of segment revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer assets or merge or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness, or use proceeds in violation of anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws. Our notes are subject to similar covenants except that only the 2036 Notes contain covenants limiting or restricting subsidiary indebtedness and none of our notes are subject to a covenant that limits our ability to impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends. Our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility require us to maintain a consolidated adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio of greater than 3:1 (ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income/(loss) plus the sum of (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation expense, (iv) amortization expense, (v) any other non-cash deductions, losses or charges made in determining net income/(loss) for such period, and (vi) extraordinary, non-recurring, or unusual losses or charges (including costs and expenses of litigation included in operating income), minus extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual gains provided that the amount added back\nOur most recent measurement date for our pension plan was December 31, 2020. The calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost is dependent upon three primary assumptions: (i) expected long-term return on plan assets, (ii) discount rate, and (iii) life expectancy trends.\n \u25cf The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. \nTransaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment. A Consumer-to-Consumer transaction constitutes the transfer of funds to a designated recipient utilizing one of our consumer money transfer services. The geographic split for transactions and revenue in the table that follows, including Digital Money Transfer transactions, is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated. Included in each region's transaction and revenue percentages in the tables below are Digital Money Transfer transactions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Where reported separately in the discussion below, Digital Money Transfer, and its subset westernunion.com, consist of 100% of the transactions conducted and funded through those respective channels.\nEarnings Per Share\n (b) As of December 31, 2020, our weighted-average effective rate on total borrowings was approximately 3.5%. \nBusiness Solutions\nOn March 30, 2010, we exchanged $303.7 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due November 17, 2011 for unsecured notes due April 1, 2020 ( 2020 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2020 Notes was payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of 5.253%. In connection with the exchange, note holders were given a 7% premium ($21.2 million), which approximated market value at the exchange date, as additional principal. As this transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, this premium was not charged to expense. Rather, the premium, along with the offsetting hedge accounting adjustments, was accreted into Interest expense over the life of the notes. On November 18, 2019, we announced a cash tender offer on our outstanding 2020 Notes. On November 25, 2019, we purchased the principal amount of $56.1 million, plus accrued interest, pursuant to the tender offer. On December 27, 2019, we redeemed the remaining principal amount of $268.8 million, plus accrued interest. The total premium paid to redeem the 2020 Notes was $3.1 million.\nAssuming that our operations are not significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic for a protracted period, we currently believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs, including payments under our debt and other obligations, through our existing cash balances, our ability to generate cash flows through operations, and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which expires in January 2025 and supports our commercial paper program. Our commercial paper program enables us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of any borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility and $80.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the commercial paper program.\nOn November 25, 2019, we issued $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due January 10, 2025 ( 2025 Notes\u201d). We used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Notes to redeem our 2020 Notes, as defined below, and for general corporate purposes. Interest with respect to the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 10 and July 10 of each year, beginning on July 10, 2020, based on the per annum rate of 2.850%. The interest rate payable on the 2025 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to these notes is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on the 2025 Notes exceed 4.850% per annum. The interest rate payable on the 2025 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below 2.850% per annum. We may redeem the 2025 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to December 10, 2024 at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points. We may redeem the 2025 Notes at any time after December 10, 2024 at a price equal to par, plus accrued interest.\n \u25cf Cash flow hedges - Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted revenues, as well as hedges of the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in Accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCL\u201d) are reclassified to earnings in the same period the hedged item affects earnings when the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. \nEarnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was impacted by the previously described factors impacting net income and a lower number of shares outstanding. Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by the gain on the sale of Speedpay in the second quarter of 2019. The lower number of shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year is due to stock repurchases exceeding stock issuances related to our stock compensation programs.\nOther primarily consists of our cash-based bill payments businesses in Argentina and the United States, in addition to our money order services. As previously described, we entered into an agreement on February 28, 2019 to sell Speedpay and closed the transaction on May 9, 2019. Speedpay revenues and direct operating expenses included in our results were $125.4 million and $98.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn August 22, 2017, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due May 22, 2019 ( Floating Rate Notes\u201d). The Floating Rate Notes were repaid in May 2019 using proceeds from the Speedpay divestiture, commercial paper, and cash, including cash generated from operations.\nRevenues compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by COVID-19, which caused governments around the world to institute various protective measures in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. These measures, which include lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and closures of non-essential businesses, negatively impacted our ability to offer services, at least temporarily, through some of our retail agent locations across all of our regions. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures also resulted in a decline in economic activity that negatively impacted our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decline was caused by decreases in transactions from our retail business and was partially offset by growth in Digital Money Transfer transactions, including transactions initiated through westernunion.com. We believe that our growth in Digital Money Transfer transactions was due, in part, to shifts in consumer behavior to send money through digital channels, including as a result of COVID-19. The significant majority of agent locations that had been closed as a result of COVID-19 have resumed offering our services as of December 31, 2020, although certain of our retail locations remain closed.\nOperating Leases\nOn February 10, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.235 per common share payable on March 31, 2021.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nInvestment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly-rated securities and diversifying our investment portfolio. Our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration. As of December 31, 2020, all investments with a single issuer and each individual security represented less than 10% of our investment securities portfolio.\nWe manage our business around the consumers and businesses we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups, distribution networks, and services offered. Our segments are Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions.\nThe carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2020 was $2,566.6 million which represented approximately 27% of our consolidated assets. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill of $1,980.7 million and $532.0 million resides in our Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions reporting units, respectively, while the remaining $53.9 million resides in Other. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not record any goodwill impairments. For the reporting units that comprise Consumer-to-Consumer and Other, the fair values of the businesses significantly exceed their carrying amounts.\nCommercial Paper Program\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes requires significant judgment. We routinely receive, and may in the future receive, questions from taxing authorities on various tax-related assertions. In many of these instances, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain, given the complexities in interpreting tax laws and applying our facts and circumstances to these laws in many jurisdictions throughout the world.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nOn May 6, 2019, we completed the sale of Paymap for contingent consideration and immaterial cash proceeds received at closing. Paymap revenues and direct operating expenses included in our results were $5.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe have historically implemented price reductions or price increases throughout many of our global corridors. We will likely continue to implement price changes from time to time in response to competition and other factors. Price reductions generally reduce margins and adversely affect financial results in the short term and may also adversely affect financial results in the long term if transaction volumes do not increase sufficiently. Price increases may adversely affect transaction volumes, as consumers may not use our services if we fail to price them appropriately.\nOther operating income increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year due to the change in allocated information technology expenses, as previously discussed, and a decrease in costs related to strategic initiatives, including for the review and closing of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, partially offset by a decrease in revenues, net of a reduction in direct expenses from the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures, and a decrease in revenues from our cash-based bill payments services.\n \u25cf As described in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4, Restructuring-Related Expenses on August 1, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an overall plan to change our operating model and improve our business processes and cost structure by reducing our headcount and consolidating various facilities. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred $36.8 million and $115.5 million, respectively, related to this plan. While certain of these expenses may be identifiable to our segments, primarily our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, the expenses are not included in the measurement of segment operating income provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. \nPursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $80.0 million and $245.0 million in commercial paper borrowings outstanding, respectively. Our commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2020 had a weighted-average annual interest rate of approximately 0.3% and a weighted-average term of approximately 5 days. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average commercial paper balance outstanding was $181.6 million and $193.6 million, respectively, and the maximum balance outstanding was $690.0 million and $630.0 million, respectively. Proceeds from our commercial paper borrowings were used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs.\nFinancing Resources\nOur Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer service facilitates money transfers sent from our retail agent locations worldwide and our Digital Money Transfer services. The segment includes five geographic regions whose functions are primarily related to generating, managing, and maintaining agent relationships and localized marketing activities. We include Digital Money Transfer transactions in our regions, including transactions from our arrangements with financial institutions and other third parties, to enable such entities to offer money transfer services to their own customers under their brands. By means of common processes and systems, these regions, including Digital Money Transfer transactions, create one interconnected global network for consumer transactions, thereby constituting one Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business and one operating segment.\nThe following table sets forth our Business Solutions segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe following table sets forth Other results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nCapital Expenditures\nDebt Service Requirements\nDue to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, and to the varied range of potential outcomes, the actual outcomes may differ materially from our judgments.\nThe business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, our Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) are computed in accordance with the following principles:\nRevenues\nA purchase obligation is an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding, and specifies all significant terms. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $170 million of outstanding purchase obligations, of which approximately $120 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. Many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice and with a termination penalty. Termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation. Obligations under certain contracts are usage-based and are, therefore, estimated in the above amounts. Historically, we have not had any significant defaults on our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have a frozen defined benefit pension plan (the Plan\u201d), for which the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the plan assets was $280.6 million, which exceeded the projected benefit obligation of $240.7 million and resulted in prepaid pension costs of $39.9 million. As of December 31, 2019, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets, which resulted in an unfunded pension obligation of $11.4 million. We were not required to and did not make a contribution to the Plan in 2020 and 2019, and we are not required to make any contributions to the Plan in 2021.\nWe have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. Our tax reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include: (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes in facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue during the period and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the consolidated financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period.\nRevenues Overview\nOther Intangible Assets\nIn addition to the payment of interest, we are required to make certain periodic amortization payments with respect to the outstanding principal of the term loan, beginning in 2021. The final maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is January 8, 2024.\nOperating Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Business Solutions operating income and operating income margin decreased when compared to the prior year due to the impact of revenue declines, as discussed above, and costs associated with the termination of a property lease in the United States, partially offset by a reduction in employee-related expenses.\nIncome Taxes\n\n\n (a) Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, resulted in a reduction to revenues of $157.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to foreign currency rates in the prior year. Included within this amount are impacts related to the strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso, which resulted in a reduction to revenues of $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to foreign currency rates in the prior year. \nConsumer-to-Consumer money transfer revenue decreased 4% and transactions were flat for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, including as a result of the impacts from the worldwide actions related to COVID-19. Revenues were impacted by a decrease in transaction volumes from retail locations, which were offset by growth in digital transactions, including from white label partnerships. The spread between transaction volumes and revenue decline was primarily attributable to growth in our digital white label partnerships, which have a lower revenue per transaction than Western Union branded transactions. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, negatively impacted revenue by 1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Constant currency revenue decreased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLegal Contingencies\n \u25cf Consumer-to-Consumer - Our Consumer-to-Consumer operating segment facilitates money transfers, which are sent from our retail agent locations worldwide or through websites and mobile devices, including our fast-growing money transfer transactions conducted and funded through websites and mobile applications marketed under our brands ( westernunion.com\u201d) and transactions initiated on the internet and mobile applications hosted by our third-party white label or co-branded digital partners (together with westernunion.com, Digital Money Transfer\u201d). Our money transfer service is provided through one interconnected global network. This service is available for international cross-border transfers and, in certain countries, intra-country transfers. \nAs of December 31, 2020, we had the following outstanding borrowings (in millions):\nGoodwill\nIncome Taxes\n (a) Constant currency revenue growth assumes that revenues denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the United States dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. \nWe use derivatives to minimize our exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which fluctuate based on market conditions. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, Note 15, Derivatives. The substantial majority of these derivative contracts relate to our Business Solutions segment, which facilitates cross-currency payments by writing derivatives to customers, and a significant majority of these Business Solutions derivative contracts have a duration at inception of less than one year.\nor formalized minimum net worth requirements, and (iii) restrictions on transferring assets outside of the countries where these assets are located. See also Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, Business and Basis of Presentation.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n \u25cf Corporate costs, including stock-based compensation and other overhead, are allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments' revenue compared to total revenue. \nSubstantially all of our cash flows from operating activities have been generated from subsidiaries. Most of these cash flows are generated from our regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use, except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions, including: (i) requirements to maintain cash and other qualifying investment balances, free of any liens or other encumbrances, related to the payment of certain of our money transfer and other payment obligations, (ii) other legal or regulatory restrictions, including statutory\n\nCredit Ratings and Debt Covenants\nOn June 11, 2018, we issued $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 9, 2023 ( 2023 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 9 and December 9 of each year, beginning on December 9, 2018, based on the per annum rate of 4.250%. The interest rate payable on the 2023 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to these notes is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on the 2023 Notes exceed 6.250% per annum. The interest rate payable on the 2023 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below 4.250% per annum. We may redeem the 2023 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 9, 2023 at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 25 basis points. We may redeem the 2023 Notes at any time after May 9, 2023 at a price equal to par, plus accrued interest.\nOur impairment assessment typically begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The initial qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results. Additionally, each reporting unit's fair value is assessed under certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity-specific events. Periodically, we perform a quantitative assessment, as described below, for each of our reporting units, regardless of the results of prior qualitative assessments.\nOn March 15, 2017, we issued $400.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due March 15, 2022. On August 22, 2017, we issued an additional $100.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due March 15, 2022, for an aggregate principal total of $500.0 million of 3.600% unsecured notes ( 2022 Notes\u201d). The notes issued on August 22, 2017 are part of the same series and, accordingly, have the same terms and conditions as the notes issued on March 15, 2017; however, the notes issued on August 22, 2017 were issued at a premium of 101.783% and we received $1.57 million of accrued interest upon issuance. Interest with respect to the 2022 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2017, based on the per annum rate of 3.600%. The interest rate payable on the 2022 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to the note is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on the 2022 Notes exceed 5.600% per annum. The interest rate payable on the 2022 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below 3.600% per annum. We may redeem the 2022 Notes at any time prior to February 15, 2022 at the greater of par or a price based on the\nOther\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\n\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur ability to grow the business, make investments in our business, make acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, including through dividends and share repurchases, and service our debt and tax obligations will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify acquisitions that align with our long-term strategy. For additional information, please refer to Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nOn June 21, 2010, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 21, 2040 ( 2040 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2040 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 21 and December 21 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2040 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 30 basis points.\n (a) Calculation not meaningful. \nTotal Other Income/(Expense), Net\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, basic earnings per share were $1.81 and $2.47, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.79 and $2.46, respectively. Outstanding options to purchase Western Union stock and unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 1.6 million and 1.9 million, respectively, of shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method, primarily due to outstanding restricted stock units and options to purchase shares of Western Union stock, as the assumed proceeds of the restricted stock and options per unit were above our weighted-average share price during the periods and their effect was anti-dilutive.\nOur 2021 and future debt service requirements will include payments on all outstanding indebtedness, including any borrowings under our commercial paper program. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial and Supplemental Data, Note 16, Borrowings for details on our outstanding borrowings, including future principal payments on our notes, term loan, and commercial paper. As of December 31, 2020, the total projected interest payments on our borrowings were $960.9 million, of which $104.5 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. We have estimated our future interest payments based on the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our notes. However, we may refinance all or a portion of our borrowings in future periods. Estimated interest payments on floating-rate debt are calculated by utilizing the effective rate and forward rates as of December 31, 2020 for our current and future interest rates, respectively.\n (a) Calculation not meaningful. \n (b) Our LACA region results were impacted by the strengthening of the United States dollar against the Argentine peso, in addition to an increase in local currency revenue per transaction, primarily due to inflation. \nto assess whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable in determining whether an accrual is appropriate. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. When a potential loss is considered probable and the reasonable estimate is a range, we accrue on the low end of the range when no amount is a better estimate than any other amount.\nConsumer-to-Consumer revenues in 2021 could be negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19. The duration and severity of the pandemic as well as the responses of government authorities to the pandemic, the macro economic consequences, and the impacts on consumer behavior are uncertain. We expect that our results will continue to be adversely impacted as long as such factors persist.\nOur objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital structure consistent with investment-grade credit ratings. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities, access to the commercial paper markets, and our Revolving Credit Facility available to support the needs of our business.\nWe are a leading provider of money movement and payment services, operating in two business segments:\nTotal other income/(expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by the non-recurring gain on the sale of our United States based electronic bill payments business known as Speedpay. In addition, total other income/(expense), net benefitted from a reduction in interest expense driven by a lower weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding debt during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.\nThe accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements. The details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, and how effectiveness is being assessed. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis. If the hedge is no longer deemed effective, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship on a prospective basis.\nConsumer-to-Consumer Segment\n\nRestructuring-Related Expenses\nCash Priorities\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and our Term Loan Facility contain interest rate margins which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings, and our Revolving Credit Facility also contains a facility fee that is based on our credit ratings. In addition, the interest rates payable on our 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2025 Notes can be impacted by our credit ratings. We are also subject to certain provisions in many of our notes and certain of our derivative contracts, which could require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade, as further described below. We do not have any other terms within our debt agreements that are tied to changes in our credit ratings.\nLiquidity\nRevenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers to transfer money. These revenues vary by transaction based upon factors such as channel, send and receive locations, the principal amount sent, whether the money transfer involves different send and receive currencies, the difference between the exchange rate we set to the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market, and speed of service, as applicable. We also offer several other services, including foreign exchange and payment services and other bill payment services, for which revenue is impacted by similar factors.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $877.5 million and $914.6 million, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities can be impacted by changes to our consolidated net income, in addition to fluctuations in our working capital balances, among other factors.\nIn determining whether disclosure is appropriate, we evaluate each legal matter to assess if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss or additional material losses may have been incurred beyond those amounts which we have already accrued. If such a reasonable possibility exists, we include an estimate of possible loss or range of loss in our disclosure of reasonably possible potential litigation losses or we state if such an estimate of possible loss or range of loss cannot be made.\n \u25cf All items not included in operating income are excluded from the segments. \nOperating Income\nOn February 28, 2019, we entered into an agreement with ACI Worldwide Corp. and ACW Worldwide, Inc. to sell our United States based electronic bill payments business known as Speedpay\u201d, which had been included as a component of Other in our segment reporting. We received approximately $750 million and recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $523 million in the all-cash transaction that closed on May 9, 2019. Speedpay revenues and direct operating expenses included in our results were $125.4 million and $98.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\ntravel restrictions, and closures of non-essential businesses in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These actions negatively impacted our ability to offer our services, at least temporarily, through a portion of our locations and our retail agent locations during the year ended December 31, 2020. Beginning in March 2020 and continuing throughout the remainder of the year, we experienced a decrease in transaction volumes from retail locations and a decrease in foreign exchange and payment services activity, which also negatively impacted revenues during this period, partially offset by revenue growth from westernunion.com and other digital transactions, as further described below. We believe this decrease is mainly due to economic decline and uncertainty resulting from the pandemic.\nDisruptions to contractual relationships, significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with contracts, or other issues significantly impacting the future cash flows associated with the contract would cause us to evaluate the recoverability of the asset and could result in an impairment charge. The net carrying value of our other intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 was $505.0 million. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded immaterial impairments related to other intangible assets.\n\n (c) Digital Money Transfer revenues have been included in the regions above. As noted above, westernunion.com is a subset of Digital Money Transfer and is included in the regions and Digital Money Transfer revenues. \nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.225 per common share in all four quarters of 2020, representing $369.9 million in total dividends. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.20 per common share in all four quarters of 2019, representing $340.8 million in total dividends. These amounts were paid to shareholders of record in the respective quarter the dividend was declared.\n2017 United States Federal Tax Liability\nNotes\nResults of Operations\na publicly announced authorization through December 31, 2020. However, we have resumed share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2020, $782.6 million remains available under the share repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors through December 31, 2021.\nWe could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change. If an event described above occurs and causes us to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, it would impact our reported earnings in the period such charge occurs.\nOur tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 were $310.5 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differs from our estimates, we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Furthermore, the timing of related cash payments for these tax liabilities is inherently uncertain and is affected by variable factors outside our control.\nEnhanced Regulatory Compliance\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year due to a decrease in employee-related expenses, including incentive compensation and as a result of savings from our restructuring plan, and a decrease in restructuring-related expenses. Certain of these reductions in employee-related expenses are a result of delayed hiring and a reduction in travel, which are partially due to COVID-19 and not expected to reoccur. In addition, Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased due to a decrease in marketing costs and costs related to strategic initiatives, including for the review and closing of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. These decreases were partially offset by the strengthening of the United States dollar against certain foreign currencies.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nInvestment securities, classified within Settlement assets, were $1,990.6 million and $1,698.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and consist primarily of highly-rated state and municipal debt securities, including fixed-rate term notes and variable-rate demand notes. The substantial majority of our investment securities are held in order to comply with state licensing requirements in the United States and are required to have credit ratings of A-\u201d or better from a major credit rating agency.\nThe following table sets forth our Consumer-to-Consumer segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, resulted in a reduction to revenues of $157.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year. Included within this amount are impacts related to the strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso, which resulted in a reduction to revenues of $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies negatively impacted operating income by $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year. Included within this amount are impacts related to the strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso, which resulted in a reduction to operating income of $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year.\nThe following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. For discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020.\nThe results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Income. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our segments have been eliminated. The below information has been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) unless otherwise noted. All amounts provided in this section are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, the percentage changes and margins disclosed herein may not recalculate precisely using the rounded amounts provided.\nOperating Income\nGiven the overfunded status of the Plan, we are in the process of moving towards a full allocation of fixed income investments to more closely match the Plan's assets to its liabilities. The expected long-term return on plan assets is 2.00% for 2021. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset and liability studies.\nOur future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting migrant populations and including as a result of COVID-19 related impacts, changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits, including the resolution of outstanding tax matters, and the settlement or resolution of legal contingencies. The duration and severity of COVID-19 and related impacts are uncertain, but we believe we are taking appropriate measures to attempt to address liquidity-related considerations by evaluating, monitoring, and assessing the creditworthiness and credit risk ratings of our agents and customers.\nOn November 21, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire an ownership interest in Saudi Digital Payments Company ( stc pay\u201d), a subsidiary of Saudi Telecom Company and one of our Consumer-to-Consumer digital white label partners. Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction is intended to occur in two tranches. In the first tranche, we agreed to invest approximately $133 million for a 10% investment in stc pay, and, in the second tranche, we agreed to invest an additional approximately $67 million for an additional 5% investment in stc pay. The first tranche is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021 and the closing of the second tranche is contingent upon stc pay satisfying certain conditions.\nWe have foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are designated as cash flow hedges. If these hedges no longer qualify under hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of these derivatives would be reflected into earnings, which could have a significant impact on our reported results. As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative pre-tax unrealized loss currently classified within AOCL that would be reflected in earnings if these hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was $22.9 million.\nSegment Discussion\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCash and Investment Securities\nThe fair value of the Business Solutions reporting unit continues to be sensitive to changes in projections for revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins. Our current expectation is for Business Solutions to average low to mid-single digit annual revenue growth over the 10-year forecast period, with EBITDA margins dependent on revenue growth. Our ability to achieve the projected revenue growth and EBITDA margins may be affected by, amongst other factors: (i) pricing and product competition from direct competitors, banks and new market entrants; (ii) our success and speed to market in developing new products; (iii) the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the United States dollar; (iv) increased regulatory compliance requirements; (v) our ability to enter relationships with partners that can accelerate our time to market; (vi) failure of long-term import growth rates returning to historic levels, including as a result of COVID-19; (vii) our ability to continue to maintain our payment network and bank account infrastructure; (viii) foreign currency volatility impacts on customer activity; and (ix) continued opportunities for cost reduction. Based on assumptions used within the Business Solutions reporting unit valuation, we believe an approximate 100 basis point decrease in the ten-year compound annual growth rate of revenue (also reflecting the assumed impact such a reduction would have on EBITDA margins) would result in a reduction in the fair value of the Business Solutions reporting unit of approximately $175 million. Such a reduction would result in the fair value approximating the carrying value of the reporting unit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes.\n (b) In May 2019, we sold a substantial majority of our United States based electronic bill payments services. Speedpay revenues included in our results were $125.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Paymap Inc. ( Paymap\u201d), which we sold in May 2019, provides electronic mortgage bill payment services, and related revenues included in our results were $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. \nOur critical accounting policies and estimates, described below, are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and our results of operations and applying them requires our management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments. We believe that the understanding of these key accounting policies and estimates is essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition.\nOn November 17, 2006, we issued $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due November 17, 2036 ( 2036 Notes\u201d). Interest with respect to the 2036 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 17 and November 17 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 25 basis points.\nWe capitalize acquired intangible assets as well as certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts and software. We evaluate such intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets or operations are compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write-down to fair value (normally measured by the present value technique) is required.\nOperating Expenses Overview\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe table below sets forth regional revenues as a percentage of our Consumer-to-Consumer revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOn November 22, 2013, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due May 22, 2019 ( 2019 Notes\u201d). The 2019 Notes were repaid in May 2019 using proceeds from the Speedpay divestiture, commercial paper, and cash, including cash generated from operations.\nIf we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows and compare the estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then an impairment is recognized for the difference. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further discussion regarding our accounting policies for goodwill and any related impairments.\nAll businesses and other services that have not been classified in the above segments are reported as Other, which primarily includes our bill payment services which facilitate payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations and our money order services. Our other services, in addition to certain corporate costs such as costs related to strategic initiatives, including costs for the review and closing of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, are also included in Other. Additional information on our segments is further described in the Segment Discussion below.\nGenerally, interest under the Term Loan Facility is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of 125 basis points. The interest rate margin percentage is based on certain of our credit ratings and will increase or decrease in the event of certain upgrades or downgrades in our credit ratings.\nThe assumptions related to life expectancy are used to estimate the expected period over which pension benefits will be required to be paid. Projections used for life expectancy are based on mortality tables and mortality improvement tables, which are statistical tables of expected annual mortality rates and expected future mortality improvements, respectively. We utilize a mortality table that we believe best aligns with the underlying demographics and census data of the Plan participants.\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion.\nThe purpose of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is diversified through a group of 19 participating institutions, is to provide general liquidity and to support our commercial paper program, which we believe enhances our short-term credit rating. The largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of $1.5 billion is approximately 11%. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. If the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility decreased, or if the Revolving Credit Facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted.\nIncome taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe after applying the required analyses and judgments.\nWe had approximately $390 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of December 31, 2020 primarily held in connection with safeguarding consumer funds, lease arrangements, and certain agent agreements. The significant majority of our letters of credit and bank guarantees have a one-year renewal option, and we expect to renew prior to expiration in most circumstances.\nInterest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of 110 basis points. A facility fee of 15 basis points is also payable quarterly on the total facility, regardless of usage. Both the interest rate margin and facility fee percentage are based on certain of our credit ratings.\n\nDue to the significance of the effect that foreign exchange fluctuations against the United States dollar can have on our reported revenues, constant currency results have been provided in the table below for consolidated revenues. We have also disclosed the impact of divestitures on our revenues in the table below. Additionally, due to the significance of our Consumer-to-Consumer segment to our overall results, we have also provided constant currency results for our Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenues. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the United States dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. Constant currency measures and measures that exclude the impact of divestitures are non-GAAP financial measures and are provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and divestitures of our businesses, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. We believe that these measures provide management and investors with information about revenue results and trends that eliminates currency volatility and divestitures, thereby providing greater clarity regarding, and increasing the comparability of, our underlying results and trends. These disclosures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.\nOn August 1, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a plan to change our operating model and improve our business processes and cost structure by reorganizing our senior management, including those managers reporting to our chief executive officer, reducing our headcount, and consolidating various facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $36.8 million related to this plan. Of this amount, $4.5 million and $32.3 million are included within Cost of services and Selling, general, and administrative, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $115.5 million of expenses related to this plan, of which $39.8 million and $75.7 million are included within Cost of services and Selling, general, and administrative, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4, Restructuring-Related Expenses for further discussion. As of December 31, 2020, all expenses associated with this plan have been incurred and substantially all have been and will continue to be paid in cash. The plan generated expense savings of more than $50 million in 2020 and we expect to generate approximately $100 million of expense savings in 2021, which is our estimate and subject to change.\nCost of services primarily consists of agent commissions, which represented approximately 60% of total cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of services decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year due to a decrease in agent commissions in our Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business, which generally vary with revenues, including due to fluctuations between the United States dollar and foreign currencies, the Speedpay divestiture during the second quarter of 2019, a decrease in employee-related expenses, including as a result of reduced hiring, and a decrease in restructuring-related expenses, partially offset by an increase in credit losses.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated revenue results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOther Commercial Commitments\nBusiness Solutions revenue decreased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decline in payment services activity, generally across all geographic regions. We believe this decrease was due to a downturn in economic conditions and trade, which primarily resulted from the effects of COVID-19. We expect that to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or the related macro-economic consequences continue, we could continue to experience declines in cross-currency payments and reductions to segment revenues in future periods.\nConsumer-to-Consumer operating income decreased 5% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues, increased allocations of certain information technology expenses, as previously discussed, an increase in credit losses, and the strengthening of the United States dollar against certain foreign currencies, partially offset by decreases in employee-related expenses, as described above, including incentive compensation and as a result of reduced hiring and savings from our restructuring plan, as well as decreases in marketing costs. Certain of these reductions in employee-related expenses are a result of delayed hiring and a reduction in travel, which are partially due to COVID-19 and not expected to reoccur.\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nto net income (or net loss) for such extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges may not exceed 10% of adjusted EBITDA, in each case determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for such period, to interest expense) for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 11:1 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther revenue decreased 48% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the sale of Speedpay in the second quarter of 2019 and declines in revenues from our cash-based bill payments services offered at retail locations, including as a result of the strengthening of the United States dollar against the Argentine peso, partially offset by an increase in local currency revenue per transaction, primarily due to inflation.\nWe use derivatives to: (i) minimize our exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, periodically, interest rates and (ii) facilitate cross-currency Business Solutions payments by writing derivatives to customers. We recognize all derivatives in Other assets and Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception, and others are not designated as accounting hedges.\nForeign Currency Derivative Contracts\nCertain of our notes (including the 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes, and 2040 Notes) include a change of control triggering event provision, as defined in the terms of the notes. If a change of control triggering event occurs, holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of their notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of their notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. A change of control triggering event will occur when there is a change of control involving us and among other things, within a specified period in relation to the change of control, the notes are downgraded from an investment grade rating to below an investment grade rating by certain major credit rating agencies.\n (a) The difference between the stated interest rate and the effective interest rate is not significant. \nOur effective tax rates on pre-tax income were 12.9% and 19.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher prior period domestic pre-tax income associated with the sales of the Speedpay and Paymap businesses, prior period settlements in certain geographies, and discrete tax benefits in the current period.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\nPension Plan\nRevenues for all Consumer-to-Consumer regions compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in NA revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily the result of declines in money transfers sent and received in the United States. The decrease in EU & CIS and MEASA revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was driven by transaction declines in retail money transfers, partially offset by transaction growth from digital white label partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in LACA revenue, which generates a higher proportion of revenues from retail locations compared to our other regions, was primarily due to transaction declines caused by continued COVID-19-related government protective measures, including agent location closures in the region. For the year ended December 31, 2020, westernunion.com revenues, which have been included in the regions as described above, were negatively impacted by net price reductions.\nWe are subject to certain claims and litigation that could result in losses, including damages, fines, and/or civil penalties, which could be significant, and in some cases, criminal charges. We regularly evaluate the status of legal matters\nTo help ensure availability of our worldwide cash where needed, we utilize a variety of planning and financial strategies, including decisions related to the amounts, timing, and manner by which cash is made available from our international subsidiaries. These decisions can influence our overall tax rate and impact our total liquidity. We regularly evaluate, taking tax consequences and other factors into consideration, our United States cash requirements and also the potential uses of cash internationally to determine the appropriate level of dividend repatriations of our foreign source income.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining whether a loss is probable and whether the loss can be reasonably estimated, including determining a loss value within a range. Our judgments are subjective and are based on considerations such as the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultations with in-house and outside legal counsel. As the outcome of claims and litigation is uncertain, accruals are based on the best information available at the time the judgment is made. As additional information becomes available, which may include information we learn through the discovery process, settlement discussions, or rulings by courts, arbitrators or others, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.\nCost of Services\nThe Tax Act imposed a tax on certain of our previously undistributed foreign earnings. This tax charge, combined with our other 2017 United States taxable income and tax attributes, resulted in a 2017 United States federal tax liability of approximately $800 million, of which approximately $604 million remained as of December 31, 2020. We have elected to pay this liability in periodic installments through 2025. Under the terms of the law, we owe 8% of the original liability in both 2021 and 2022, with 15%, 20%, and 25% of the tax owed in 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we made installment payments of $64.0 million. These payments have affected and will continue to adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity and may adversely affect future share repurchases.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we changed our expense allocation method so that our corporate data center and network engineering information technology expenses are allocated based on a percentage of relative revenue. In 2019, these costs had been allocated based in part on a percentage of relative transactions. We believe that an allocation method based fully on relative revenue presents a more representative view of segment profitability, as certain of our services, particularly some of our bill payment services and our money order services, have much lower revenues per transaction than our other services. Further, these technology expenses are becoming increasingly based on data storage utilized and less based on the number of transactions processed. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this change would have decreased Consumer-to-Consumer operating income and increased Other operating income by $49.6 million. Business Solutions was not materially impacted by the change in the allocation method.\n \u25cf Fair value hedges - Fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed-rate debt, through interest rate swaps. The changes in fair value of these hedges, along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, are recorded in Interest expense. \nThe discount rate assumption is based on the rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled and is determined by matching the timing and balance of anticipated payouts under the Plan to the rates from an AA spot rate yield curve, which is derived from AA bonds of varying maturities. The discount rate assumption for our benefit obligation was 1.66% and 2.66% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 100 basis point change to both the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact to our annual pension expense.\nPurchase Obligations\nOur consumers transferred $96.1 billion and $87.7 billion in Consumer-to-Consumer principal for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, of which $90.6 billion and $80.7 billion, respectively, related to cross-border principal. The increase in principal and cross-border principal transferred during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year is attributable to growth in Digital Money Transfer. Consumer-to-Consumer principal is the amount of consumer funds transferred to the designated recipient. Cross-border principal is the amount of consumer funds transferred to a designated recipient in a country or territory that differs from the country or territory from which the transaction was initiated. Consumer-to-Consumer principal and cross-border principal are metrics used by management to monitor and better understand the growth in our underlying business relative to competitors, as well as changes in our market share of global remittances.\nWe lease real properties for use as administrative and sales offices, in addition to transportation, office, and other equipment. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, Note 13, Leases for details on our leasing arrangements, including future maturities of our operating lease liabilities.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n \u25cf Business Solutions - Our Business Solutions operating segment facilitates payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals. The majority of the segment's business relates to exchanges of currency at spot rates, which enable customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, in certain countries, we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments. \nOur primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of payments for employee and agent incentives, interest payments on our outstanding borrowings and timing of income tax payments, among other items. Many of our annual employee incentive compensation and agent incentive payments are made in the first quarter following the year they were incurred. The majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters. The annual payments resulting from the United States tax reform legislation enacted in 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d) include amounts related to the United States taxation of certain previously undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. These payments are typically due in the second quarter of each year through 2025.\nIncome Tax Contingencies\nDerivative Financial Instruments\napplicable treasury rate plus 25 basis points. We may redeem the 2022 Notes at any time after February 15, 2022 at a price equal to par, plus accrued interest.\nRevenues\nThe capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the amount to capitalize and the related period of benefit. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given agent contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract. Additionally, the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with each asset requires us to make estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, revenue growth rates and operating margins based on our budgets and business plans.\nInvestment in Saudi Digital Payments Company\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed, arising from business combinations. An impairment assessment of goodwill is conducted annually during our fourth quarter at the reporting unit level. This assessment of goodwill is performed more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Reporting units are determined by the level at which management reviews segment operating results. In some cases, that level is the operating segment and in others it is one level below the operating segment.\nThe credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in our overall business, managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings, cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity, and the overall business.\nThe determination of the reporting units and which reporting units to include in the qualitative assessment requires significant judgment. Also, all of the assumptions used in the qualitative assessment require judgment. Additionally, for the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we calculate the fair value of reporting units through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including, among other items, revenue growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans. Development of such estimates and assumptions and the resultant fair value takes into consideration expected regulatory, marketplace, and other economic factors as well as relevant discount rates and terminal values.\nTerm Loan Facility\nDigital Money Transfer, which is included in the regional percentages above, represented approximately 20% and 14% of our Consumer-to-Consumer revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn December 18, 2018, we extended the Term Loan Facility providing for an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $950.0 million. In October 2016, we borrowed $575.0 million under our prior term loan facility. In December 2018, we borrowed the remaining amount available under the Term Loan Facility.\nThe total aggregate amount paid for contract costs, purchases of property and equipment, and purchased and developed software was $156.8 million and $127.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amounts paid for new and renewed agent contracts vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed contract signings. Other capital expenditures during these periods included investments in our information technology infrastructure and purchased and developed software.\nThe table below sets forth revenue and transaction changes by geographic region compared to the prior year. Consumer-to-Consumer segment constant currency revenue growth/(decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure, as further discussed in Revenues Overview above.\nThese expenses are specific to this initiative; however, the types of expenses related to this initiative are similar to expenses that we have previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future.\nWe have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of tax contingency reserves was $310.5 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. Our tax reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include: (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes in facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue during the period, and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows.\nOn December 18, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of $1.5 billion, including a $250.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. On December 18, 2019, we extended the final maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to January 8, 2025.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe financial services industry, including money services businesses, continues to be subject to increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements, and we continue to focus on and regularly review our compliance programs. In connection with these reviews, and in light of growing and rapidly evolving regulatory complexity and heightened attention of, and increased dialogue with, governmental and regulatory authorities related to our compliance activities, we have made, and continue to make, enhancements to our processes and systems designed to detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud and other illicit activity, and enhancements designed to improve consumer protection. Some of these changes have had, and we believe will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nRevenues\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak associated with a novel coronavirus a pandemic ( COVID-19\u201d), and governments throughout the world instituted various actions such as lockdowns, stay-at-home orders,\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 8.5 million and 26.9 million shares, respectively, have been repurchased for $217.4 million and $540.0 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at an average cost of $25.45 and $20.07, respectively. During the first quarter of 2020, we temporarily paused and did not resume share repurchases under\nWe believe that Other revenues could continue to be negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19 to the extent the pandemic or the related macro-economic consequences continue, as we may continue to experience decreases in our cash-based bill payments services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, GAAP revenues decreased when compared to the prior year, including as a result of the impacts from the worldwide actions related to COVID-19. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced a decrease in transaction volumes from retail locations in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, which was offset by growth in digital transactions, including from white label partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2020, GAAP revenues also decreased when compared to the prior year due to fluctuations between the United States dollar and other currencies and the divestitures of the Speedpay and Paymap businesses during the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in revenues constant currency adjusted and excluding divestitures (Non-GAAP) was primarily the result of the impacts from the worldwide actions related to COVID-19, as discussed above.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,428.2 million and $1,450.5 million, respectively. In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of those transactions. These funds, referred to as Settlement assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments, classified as Cash and cash equivalents within Settlement assets, to fund settlement obligations.\nOverview",

Excluding currency impact and divestitures, revenues declined 3%.\n- Net income was $744 million, down 30% from 2019, primarily due to lower revenues and the prior year gain on sale of Speedpay business.\n\nSegments\n- Consumer-to-Consumer (87% of revenues) saw a 4% revenue decline due to lower retail transactions offset partially by digital transaction growth. Transactions were flat. \n- Business Solutions (8% of revenues) revenues declined 48% on lower cross-border payment activity due to economic downturn from COVID-19.\n- Other (5% of revenues) revenues declined 48%, primarily due to 2019 Speedpay and Paymap divestitures. \n\nCOVID-19 Impact\n- COVID negatively impacted revenue due to lower transactions from temporary agent closures and cross-border payment declines from economic downturn. Digital transactions grew partially offsetting retail declines.\n\nLiquidity & Capital\n- Maintained adequate liquidity through cash generation and access to credit facilities.  Ended year with $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\n- Paused share repurchases for a period in 2020 due to uncertainty from COVID, but resumed repurchases in 2021.\n\nThat covers the key points from the report including a high-level summary of financial performance, discussion of the segments and impact of COVID-19, and comments on liquidity and capital management.
