Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of this report. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a global healthcare company that provides clinically-actionable genomic information to personalize cancer treatment. We develop and globally commercialize genomic-based clinical laboratory services that analyze the underlying biology of cancer, allowing physicians and patients to make individualized treatment decisions. We are translating significant amounts of genomic data that will be useful for treatment planning throughout the cancer patient's journey, from diagnosis to treatment selection and monitoring. We offer our Oncotype DX tests as a clinical laboratory service, where we analyze the expression levels of genes in tumor tissue samples and provide physicians with a quantitative gene expression profile expressed as a single quantitative score, which we call a Recurrence Score for invasive breast cancer and colon cancer, a DCIS Score for ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, and a Genomic Prostate Score, or GPS, for prostate cancer\nIn January 2004, we launched our first Oncotype DX test, which is used to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit in early stage invasive breast cancer patients. In January 2010, we launched our second Oncotype DX test, the first multigene expression test developed to assess risk of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients. In late December 2011, we made Oncotype DX available for patients with DCIS, a pre-invasive form of breast cancer. In June 2012, we extended our offering of the Oncotype DX colon cancer test to patients with stage III disease treated with oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant therapy. In May 2013, we launched our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test, which is used to predict disease aggressiveness in men with low risk disease.As of February 29, 2016, the list price of our Oncotype DX breast cancer tests in the United States was $4,620, the list price of our Oncotype DX colon cancer test was $4,420 and the list price of our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test was $4,520. The substantial majority of our historical revenues have been derived from the sale of Oncotype DX breast cancer tests ordered by physicians in the United States.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, more than 107,030 Oncotype DX test reports were delivered for use in treatment planning, compared to more than 95,630 and 85,510 test reports delivered for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. All of our tests are conducted at our clinical reference laboratory in Redwood City, California. Our clinical reference laboratory processing capacity is currently approximately 120,000 tests annually, and has significant expansion capacity with incremental increases in laboratory personnel and equipment. The Oncotype DX breast, colon, and prostate cancer tests analyze different genes. However, all of the tests are based on a similar Oncotype DX reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR platform. We believe that we currently have sufficient capacity to process current demand for our tests.\nIn connection with the May 2013 launch of our prostate cancer test, we have expanded our clinical laboratory processing capacity. We expect our continued commercialization efforts of our prostate cancer test will result in increased costs for laboratory testing, including staffing-related costs, incremental sales and marketing personnel to introduce our product to a new group of physicians and patients, costs for clinical utility studies and costs associated with obtaining reimbursement coverage.\nWe depend upon third-party payors, both public and private, to provide reimbursement for our tests. Accordingly, we have and expect to continue to focus substantial resources on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement coverage from third-party payors.\nWe have continued to expand our business, both in the United States and internationally. We currently plan to continue to use substantially the same business model internationally as we use in the United States, however, there are significant differences between countries that need to be considered. For example, operational requirements generally vary from country to country, and different countries may have a public healthcare system, a combination of public and private healthcare system or a cash-based payment system. We have a direct commercial presence with employees in Canada, Japan and certain European counties, including our European headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Additionally, we have exclusive distribution agreements for the sale of our breast and colon cancer tests with distributors covering more than 90 countries outside of the United States.\nAs our international business expands, our financial results become more sensitive to the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, in countries where we have a direct commercial presence, our tests are sold in local currency, which results in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting our U.S.-dollar reported revenues. In other markets where we sell our tests in U.S. dollars to distribution partners, the demand for our tests may be impacted by the change in U.S. dollar exchange rates affecting partners' costs or local market price adjustments.\nWe expect that international sales of our Oncotype DX tests will be heavily dependent on the availability of reimbursement and sample access. In many countries, governments are primarily responsible for reimbursing diagnostic tests. Governments often have significant discretion in determining whether a test will be reimbursed at all, and if so, on what conditions, for which other competing products, and how much will be paid. In addition, certain countries, such as China, have prohibitions against exporting tissue samples which will limit our ability to offer our tests in those countries without local laboratories or a method of test delivery which does not require samples to be transported to our U.S. laboratory.\nThe majority of our international Oncotype DX breast and colon cancer test revenues come from direct payor reimbursement, payments from our distributors, patient self-pay, and clinical collaborations in various countries. We have obtained some coverage, which varies substantially from country to country, for our breast cancer test outside of the United States, including in Argentina, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In September 2013, we announced that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, in the United Kingdom issued its final guidance recommending Oncotype DX as the only multi-gene breast cancer test for use in clinical practice to guide chemotherapy treatment decisions for certain patients. We have established reimbursement with NHS England following NICE's recommendation for our breast cancer test, similar to our contracting process with U.S. insurers, and in April 2015, we began experiencing an increase in test orders from the United Kingdom. We are in the process of completing contractual arrangements with more than 100 NHS England trusts, which is necessary to begin to receive payment from each trust and recognize revenue on these tests. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we began to receive payments from NHS England trusts with whom we have completed contractual arrangements. In April 2014, we announced that the Gynecologic Oncology Working Group (AGO) in Germany updated their guidelines to recommend Oncotype DX as the only breast cancer gene expression test to predict chemotherapy benefit in early-stage, hormone receptor-positive invasive breast cancer. We expect that it will take several years to establish broad coverage and reimbursement for our Oncotype DX breast, colon and prostate cancer tests with payors in countries outside of the United States and there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful.\nEconomic Environment\nContinuing concerns over entitlement and health care reform efforts, regulatory changes and taxation issues, and geopolitical issues have contributed to uncertain expectations both for the U.S. and global economies. These factors, combined with uncertainties in business and consumer confidence and continued concerns regarding the stability of some European Union member countries, have contributed to the expectations of slower domestic and global economic growth in the near term. We periodically evaluate the impact of the economic environment on our cash management, cash collection activities and volume of tests delivered.\nAs of the date of this report, we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our short-term marketable securities, and we expect that we will continue to be able to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities. We periodically monitor the financial position of our significant third-party payors, which include Medicare and managed care companies. As of the date of this report, we do not expect the current economic environment to have a material negative impact on our ability to collect payments from third-party payors in the foreseeable future. We believe the economic environment and changes in the healthcare system continued to impact product payment cycles, growth in tests delivered and product revenue generated during the year ended December 31, 2015. We intend to continue to assess the impact of the economic environment on our business activities. If the economic environment does not improve or deteriorates, our business including our patient population, government and third-party payors and our distributors and suppliers could be negatively affected, resulting in a negative impact on our product revenues.\nU.S. Healthcare Environment\nHealthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures are being adopted in the U.S. and in many foreign countries. These reforms and measures, including those envisioned by the adoption in 2010 of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, could among other things limit the use of our tests and reduce reimbursement. We also expect that pricing of medical products and services will remain under pressure as alternative payment models such as bundling, value-based purchasing and accountable care organizations develop in the United States.\nSales of our tests in the United States and other countries are dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Market acceptance of our tests has and will continue to depend upon the ability to obtain an appropriate level of coverage for, and reimbursement from, third-party payors for our tests. We have had Medicare coverage for our Oncotype DX invasive breast cancer test since 2006 and for our Oncotype DX colon cancer test since 2011. In October 2015, we obtained Medicare coverage for our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test for patients with low and very-low risk. Under the terms of the coverage determination for our prostate cancer test, reimbursement is limited to tests ordered by physicians who agree to participate in a Certification Training Registry and to provide certain information about Medicare beneficiaries who receive our test.\nThe healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs. The effect of the implementation of the ACA on our business is uncertain. Among other things, the law requires medical device manufacturers to pay a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices that are listed with the FDA starting in January 2013; this tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, but is scheduled for re-imposition in 2018. Although the FDA has issued draft guidance that, if finalized, would regulate certain clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use, referred to as LDTs, as medical devices, none of our LDTs, such as our Oncotype DX breast, colon and prostate cancer tests, are currently listed with the FDA. We cannot assure you that the tax will not apply to services such as ours in the future.\nIn addition, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA includes a substantial new payment system for certain clinical laboratory tests that is scheduled to be effective starting in 2017. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenues from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule will be required to report every three years (or annually for advanced diagnostic laboratory tests\u201d), private payor payment rates and volumes for their tests. CMS will use the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for the tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates for the tests.\nThere have also been recent and substantial changes to the payment structure for physicians, including those passed as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which was signed into law on April 16, 2015. MACRA created the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System which, beginning in 2019, more closely aligns physician payments with composite performance the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Value-based modifier program and the Electronic Health Record Meaningful Use program, and incentivizes physicians to enroll in alternative payment methods. At this time, we do not know whether these changes to the physician payment systems will have any impact on orders or payments for our tests.\nChanges in Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) services\nOn a five year rotational basis, Medicare requests bids for its regional MAC services. In September 2013, the claims processing function for our jurisdiction transitioned from Palmetto GBA, to our current MAC, Noridian. Palmetto GBA under their MolDx Program is continuing to establish coverage, coding and reimbursement policies for molecular diagnostic tests performed in our jurisdiction, including our tests. The elimination of the MolDx Program or a change in the administrator of that program could impact the current coverage or payment rates for our existing tests and our ability to obtain Medicare coverage for products for which we do not yet have coverage or any products we may launch in the future, or delay payments for our tests.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe determine whether revenue is recognized on an accrual basis when test results are delivered or on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor. Our revenues for tests performed are recognized on an accrual basis when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. When evaluating whether the fee is fixed or determinable and collectible, we consider whether we have sufficient history to reliably estimate the total fee that will be received from a payor and a payor's individual payment patterns. Based upon at least several months of payment history, we review the number of tests paid against the number of tests billed and the payor's outstanding balance for unpaid tests to determine whether payments are being made at a consistently high percentage of tests billed and at appropriate amounts given the arrangement or contracted payment amount. The estimated accrual amounts per test, recorded upon delivery of a patient report, are calculated for each accrual payor and are based on the arrangement or contracted price adjusted for individual payment patterns resulting from co-payment amounts and excluded services in healthcare plans.\nTo the extent all criteria set forth above are not met, including where there is no evidence of payment history at the time test results are delivered, product revenues are recognized on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor.\nWe enter into exclusive distribution agreements for the sale of one or more of our Oncotype DX tests with distributors outside of the United States. In these countries, the distributor generally provides us with certain marketing and administrative services within its territory. As a condition of these agreements, the distributor generally pays us an agreed upon fee per test and we process the tests. The same revenue recognition criteria described above generally apply to tests delivered through distributors. To the extent all criteria set forth above are not met when test results are delivered, product revenues are generally recognized when cash is received from the distributor.\nTest revenue recognized on an accrual basis is recorded upon delivery of each test performed, net of any contractual discount, at the amount that we expect to collect. We determine the amount we expect to collect on a per payor, per contract or arrangement basis, based on our analysis of historical average payments. This average amount is typically lower than the agreed upon amount due to several factors, such as the amount of patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payors and claim denials. We typically review our analysis annually, or at the time a contractual price change is implemented or when information comes to our attention that leads us to believe an adjustment may be warranted.\nAs of December 31, 2015, amounts outstanding for tests delivered, net of write-downs and adjustments, which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and which had not been collected totaled approximately $73.7 million. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, and to what extent these amounts will be collected.\nFrom time to time, we receive requests for refunds of payments, generally due to overpayments made by third-party payors. Upon becoming aware of a refund request, we establish an accrued liability for tests covered by the refund request until such time as we determine whether or not a refund is due. If we determine that a refund is due, we credit cash and reduce the accrued liability. Accrued refunds were $609,000 and $944,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nContract revenues are generally derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recognized on a contract-specific basis. Under certain contracts, revenues are recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed. We may exercise judgment when estimating full-time equivalent level of effort, costs incurred and time to project completion. For certain contracts, we utilize the performance-based method of revenue recognition, which requires that we estimate the total amount of costs to be expended for a project and recognize revenue equal to the portion of costs expended to date. The estimated total costs to be expended are necessarily subject to revision from time-to-time as the underlying facts and circumstances change.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe accrue an allowance for doubtful accounts against our accounts receivable based on estimates consistent with historical payment experience. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated quarterly and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate. Historically, the amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable that have been written off have been consistent with management's expectations. We cannot assure you that we will not experience higher than expected write-offs in the future. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information, including a summary of accounts receivable aging by payor mix.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nWe recorded a net loss of $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net losses of $24.6 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. On a basic and diluted per share basis, net loss per share was $1.03, $0.78 and $0.42 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We may incur net losses in future periods due to future spending and fluctuations in our business, and we may not achieve or maintain sustained profitability in the future.\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues primarily from product sales and, to a lesser extent, from contract research arrangements. We operate in one industry segment. As of December 31, 2015, the substantial majority of our product revenues have been derived from the sale of our Oncotype DX breast cancer test. Payors are billed upon generation and delivery of test results to the physician. Product revenues are recorded on a cash basis unless a contract or arrangement to pay is in place with the payor at the time of billing and collectability is reasonably assured. Contract revenues are derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recorded as contractual obligations are completed.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n287,458 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n275,706 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n259,192 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContract revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,403 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n287,458 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n275,706 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n261,595 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod over period dollar increase in product revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,752 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,514 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod over period percentage increase in product revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe year over year increases in product revenues resulted, in part, from increased adoption. Test volume increased by 12% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Of the growth in test volume, approximately 4% was from prostate cancer tests delivered and 8% was from breast cancer tests delivered worldwide. Test volume increased by 12% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Test volume increases exceeded revenue increases primarily due to our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test, which had not yet have established reimbursement until October 2015, and tests from certain international markets where we have not yet established reimbursement. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar in 2015 resulted in a negative impact on product revenues as described below.\nInternational product revenues decreased to $41.4 million or by 8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to foreign exchange rate differences which accounted for $3.1 million of the decrease, as well as the recognition in 2014 of revenue resulting from a temporary access program in the United Kingdom. International product revenues increased to $45.0 million or by 19% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nApproximately $211.7 million, or 74%, of product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, was recorded on an accrual basis and recognized at the time the test results were delivered, compared to $199.9 million, or 73%, and $185.7 million, or 72%, of product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For all periods, the balance of product revenues was recognized upon cash collection as payments were received. The timing of recognition of revenues related to third-party payors may cause fluctuations in product revenues from period to period.\nProduct revenues related to Medicare patients for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $58.9 million, or 20%, of product revenues, compared to $55.9 million, or 20%, and $54.4 million, or 21%, of product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No other third-party payors comprised product revenues of 10% or more for those years.\nThere were no contract revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Contract revenues were $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and represented studies assessing our gene expression technology or collaborative work in gene selection and protocol design with our pharmaceutical partners. The decrease in contract revenues\nfor 2015 and 2014 compared to 2013 was due to a decrease in activities with collaboration partners. The contract revenues for 2013 included $1.5 million of contract revenue recognized in the fourth quarter upon completion of clinical validation work for Pfizer Inc. We expect that our contract revenues will continue to fluctuate based on the number and timing of studies being conducted.\nCost of Product Revenues\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTissue sample processing costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n44,022 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n38,712 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,679 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal tissue sample processing costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,547 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,209 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,162 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLicense fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,235 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,533 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,938 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal cost of product revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53,782 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n48,742 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n42,100 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod over period dollar increase in tissue sample processing costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,310 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,033 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod over period percentage increase in tissue sample processing costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of product revenues represents the cost of materials, direct labor, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing tissue samples (including sample accessioning, histopathology, anatomical pathology, paraffin extraction, RT-PCR, quality control analyses and shipping charges to transport tissue samples) and license fees. Infrastructure expenses include allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs. Costs associated with performing our tests are recorded as tests are processed. Costs recorded for tissue sample processing represent the cost of all the tests processed during the period regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test. Royalties for licensed technology calculated as a percentage of product revenues and fixed annual payments relating to the launch and commercialization of Oncotype DX tests are recorded as license fees in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized or in accordance with other contractual obligations. While license fees are generally calculated as a percentage of product revenues, the percentage increase in license fees does not correlate exactly to the percentage increase in product revenues because certain agreements contain provisions for fixed annual payments and other agreements have tiered rates and payments that may be capped at annual minimum or maximum amounts. License fees represent a significant component of our cost of product revenues and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.\nTissue sample processing costs increased $5.3 million, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and $6.0 million, or 18%, in 2014 compared to 2013, driven primarily by increases in test volume of 12% in both 2015 and 2014. The increase in 2015 was also due to higher costs per test related to our prostate cancer test.\nWe expect the cost of product revenues to increase in future periods as we process more tests.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,077 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,411 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,177 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,228 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,143 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,486 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCollaboration expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,088 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,478 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,151 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReagents and laboratory supplies\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,861 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,430 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,112 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllocated information technology, facilities and other costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,009 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,325 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,831 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,535 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,289 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,420 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n59,798 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53,076 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n64,177 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod over period dollar increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,722 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(11,101) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod over period percentage increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology, such as NGS, our proprietary liquid platform and continuous process improvement, and carry out clinical studies, primarily related to our ongoing work in breast, colon and prostate cancer. Research and development expenses include personnel-related expenses, reagents and\nsupplies used in research and development laboratory work, infrastructure expenses, including allocated overhead and facility occupancy costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies.\nThe $6.7 million, or 13%, increase in research and development expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a one-time $5.5 million expense for the wind-down of a license agreement and development program. Exclusive of this one-time expense, research and development expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 increased by $1.2 million primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in personnel-related expense, a $431,000 increase in reagents and laboratory supplies and an $85,000 increase stock-based compensation partially offset by an $890,000 decrease in collaboration expenses, a $754,000 decrease in other costs and a $316,000 decrease in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs.\nThe $11.1 million, or 17%, decrease in research and development expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 included a $7.7 million decrease in collaboration expense, a $7.5 million decrease in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs, a $682,000 decrease in reagents and laboratory supplies and a $343,000 decrease in stock-based compensation partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in other costs and a $2.2 million increase in personnel-related expenses. The $7.7 million decrease in collaboration and licensing expenses was primarily due to a $9.0 million up-front payment in 2013 under a licensing agreement.\nThe increase in personnel-related expenses for 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits due to increased headcount to support the launch of our prostate cancer test, as well as projects related to our product pipeline and ongoing work in NGS and our proprietary platform for liquid biopsy tests. The decrease in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs is primarily due to preparing for our prostate cancer product launch in 2013, which included project work from our various information technology groups, allocated based on specific development projects, as well as capitalization of certain costs of project work from our various information technology groups, allocated based on specific development projects in 2015.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in future periods due to increased investment in our new product pipeline for breast, colon, prostate and other cancers, along with increased investment in NGS and our proprietary liquid platform.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

Selling and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education, medical meeting participation and dissemination of scientific and economic publications related to our Oncotype DX tests. Our sales force compensation includes annual salaries and eligibility for quarterly commissions based on the achievement of predetermined sales goals and other management objectives.\nThe $5.7 million, or 4% increase in selling and marketing expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to U.S. and international sales and operations support and included a $3.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $2.2 million increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs, a $912,000 increase in travel, meetings and seminars and an $869,000 increase in other costs partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in promotional and marketing materials and a $296,000 decrease in stock-based compensation. Of the $3.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, $1.6 million was attributable to increases in salaries, benefits and related expenses due primarily to increased headcount, including new hires related to the launch of our prostate cancer test in May 2013 and annual salary increases, $1.6 million was attributable to higher commission and bonus payments and $112,000 was attributable to increased consulting expenses. The increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs is primarily due to increased selling activities related to our newly established prostate sales and marketing programs and information technology allocations for various projects related to scaling our commercial systems worldwide, as well as an increase in research and development support allocated from other functional areas for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe $25.1 million, or 22%, increase in selling and marketing expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to U.S. and international sales and operations support and included a $14.0 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $7.0 million increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs, a $1.5 million increase in collaboration expenses, a $1.2 million increase in promotional and marketing materials and a $960,000 increase in travel, meetings and seminars expenses. Of the $14.0 million increase in personnel-related expenses, $11.3 million was attributable to increases in salaries, benefits and related expenses due primarily to increased headcount, including new hires related to the launch of our prostate cancer test in May 2013 and annual salary increases, $1.4 million was attributable to increased consulting expenses and $1.3 million was attributable to higher commission and bonus payments.

new products, continued investment in our global commercial infrastructure and increases in our sales force.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

including rent and depreciation expenses, billing and collection fees, bad debt expense, professional fees and other expenses, including intellectual property defense and prosecution costs, and other administrative costs, partially offset by cost allocations to our commercial laboratory operations, research and development, and sales and marketing functions, including allocated information technology and facility occupancy costs.\nThe $4.7 million, or 8%, increase in general and administrative expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 included a $4.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $2.5 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses, a $1.5 million increase in professional fees and other expenses and a $601,000 increase in billing and collections fees partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in information technology, facilities and other costs allocated to other functional areas, a $726,000 decrease in bad debt expense and a $350,000 decrease in stock-based compensation. Of the $4.3 million increase in personnel-\nrelated expenses, $4.0 million was attributable to higher contract labor and consulting expenses to support growth of our business, $233,000 was attributable to an increase in bonus expense and $74,000 was attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits expenses.\nThe $5.3 million, or 10%, increase in general and administrative expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 included a $3.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $2.4 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses and a $528,000 increase in bad debt expense partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in information technology, facilities and other costs allocated to other functional areas and a $656,000 decrease in stock-based compensation. Of the $3.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, $2.2 million was attributable to increases in salaries and benefits expenses, primarily resulting from increased headcount, $1.1 million was attributable to higher contract labor and consulting expenses to support growth of our business and $286,000 was related to higher bonus payments.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we hire additional staff and incur other expenses to support the growth of our business, and to the extent we spend more on both billing and collections fees and bad debt expense.\nImpairment of Investments in Privately Held Companies\nEach of our equity investments is reviewed at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment might not be recoverable. At December 31, 2013, we concluded that the indicators of impairment of our investment in a privately held company were other than temporary, and therefore wrote off the remaining asset balance of $643,000. There was no additional impairment recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $221,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $192,000 and $222,000 for years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect our interest income will remain nominal if the current low interest rate environment continues.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther expense, net was $498,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to other expense, net of $764,000 and $158,000 for the years ended December 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was primarily related to $551,000, $790,000 and $158,000 of net foreign currency transaction losses, respectively, resulting from valuation adjustments to our international accounts receivable balance. We expect other income (expense), net to continue to fluctuate based on fluctuations in exchange rates that impact our foreign exchange transaction gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded an income tax benefit of $996,000 and income tax expense of $393,000 and $346,000, respectively. The 2015 benefit is principally comprised of a federal deferred tax benefit generated by the unrealized gain recognized in other comprehensive income during the year on available-for-sales securities reduced by income tax expense in our foreign jurisdictions. The 2014 and 2013 tax expense is principally comprised of foreign income tax and miscellaneous state income tax.\nAs a result of historical losses and based on all current available evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that our recorded net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $228.2 million. We may incur net losses in the future, and we cannot provide assurance as to when, if ever, we will achieve sustained profitability. We expect that our research and\ndevelopment expenses, selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods and, as a result, we will need to continue to generate significant product revenues to achieve sustained profitability.\nSources (Uses) of Liquidity\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $94.9 million compared to $103.7 million at December 31, 2014. The $8.8 million decrease was attributable to investments in the growth of our business, including research and development, global expansion, and activities related to reimbursement coverage of our tests partially offset by an $18.1 million investment in Invitae Corporation, or Invitae, reclassified from non-marketable securities upon Invitae's initial public offering, or IPO, in February 2015. As a publicly traded security, the market price of Invitae's common stock may be subject to volatility. For example, the price of Invitae's common stock fluctuated between $5.66 per share and $22.35 per share since the IPO in February 2015 through February 2016. In accordance with our investment policy, available cash is invested in short-term and long-term, low-risk, investment-grade debt instruments. Other than our equity investment in Invitae, our cash and marketable securities are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments including money market accounts and high-grade commercial paper and corporate bonds.\nHistorically we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and cash received in payment for our tests. Certain purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements have been partially financed through capital equipment financing arrangements.\nAccounts Receivable\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, $37.2 million, or 20%, and $34.9 million, or 19%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of accounts receivable. The $2.3 million year over year increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to increased revenues and additional payors moving from cash basis to accrual basis during 2015, partially offset by a decrease in Medicare accounts receivable. Days sales outstanding, or DSOs, is a measure of the average number of days it takes for us to collect our accounts receivable, calculated from the date that tests are billed. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our weighted average DSOs were 75 days and 78 days, respectively. The timing of our billing and cash collections may also causes fluctuations in our monthly DSOs and accounts receivable. With new unique CPT codes in place, it was necessary for payors to update their billing systems to reflect these changes, which resulted and may continue to result in payment delays and a related increase in accounts receivable balances.\nThe following tables summarize accounts receivable by payor mix at December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

We lease various facilities in Redwood City, California, totaling 180,700 square feet. The lease terms expire between March 2021 and March 2023, each with an option for us to extend the terms of the lease for an additional five years. In November 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 31,200 square feet of laboratory and office space in a nearby location. We do not currently occupy this property, however, we have included the square footage in the total leased space in Redwood City stated above. We also lease 7,500 square feet of space in Geneva, Switzerland. This lease expires in May 2021.\nWe are required to make a series of fixed annual payments under a collaboration agreement beginning with a one year anniversary of achieving a key milestone for our DCIS clinical study in June 2014. As of December 31, 2015, future annual payments include payments of $604,000, and $504,000 due in 2016, and 2017, respectively.\nWe have also committed to make potential future payments to third parties as part of our collaboration and licensing agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of specific project milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is generally neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such commitments have not been included in the table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Activities\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOperating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe currently anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, together with payments for our tests, will be sufficient to fund our operations and facilities expansion plans for at least the next 12 months, including the expansion of our research and development programs, our proprietary liquid platforms development efforts, our efforts to expand adoption of and reimbursement for our tests and our international expansion efforts. We expect to spend approximately $24 million over the next 12 months for planned laboratory equipment, information technology and facilities expansion. We may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities will also be used to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, such as licensing technology rights, distribution arrangements for our tests both within and outside of the United States or expanding our direct sales capabilities worldwide.\nThe amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, such as the amount of cash provided by our operations, the progress of our commercialization efforts, product development, regulatory requirements, progress in reimbursement for our tests and available strategic opportunities for acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products.\nWe cannot be certain that our international expansion plans, efforts to expand adoption of and reimbursement for our tests or the development of future products will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional funds to see these activities through to a successful result. It may take years to move any one of a number of product candidates in research through development and validation to commercialization.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe rate of progress in establishing and maintaining reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international third-party payors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts associated with expanding our commercial and laboratory operations, including our selling and marketing efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with expansion of our current tests and the development of new tests;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe rate of progress and cost of selling and marketing activities associated with expanding adoption of our Oncotype DX colon and prostate cancer and DCIS tests;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with NGS and our proprietary liquid platform;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts associated with acquiring, licensing or investing in technologies, including NGS and our proprietary liquid platform;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts associated with acquiring or investing in complementary businesses or assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost of acquiring or investing in complementary businesses or assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts related to future product launches;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts related to acquiring or achieving access to tissue samples and technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts related to filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts related to international expansion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products or operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe impact of changes in Federal, state and international taxation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe economic and other terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter or investments or acquisitions we might seek to effect.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf we are not able to generate and maintain sustained product revenues to finance our cash requirements, we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders may result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our product or market development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-2, Leases ( ASU 2016-2\u201d). ASU 2016-2 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. ASU 2016-2 is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019, and all annual and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-2 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d), which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for us in its first quarter of fiscal 2017, with early application permitted and, upon adoption, may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We early adopted this ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement ( ASU 2015-05\u201d). This amendment provides guidance to help entities determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software or as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, an entity has the option to apply the provisions of ASU 2015-05 either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified, or retrospectively. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-05 to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) to provide guidance on revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Net cash provided by operating activities of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflected a net loss of $24.6 million, adjusted for $23.4 million of depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, a $3.8 million increase in accrued compensation expense and employee benefits, a $3.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, a $985,000 increase in accounts payable and a $741,000 decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in accounts receivable.

and operations support and included a $14.0 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $7.0 million increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs, a $1.5 million increase in collaboration expenses, a $1.2 million increase in promotional and marketing materials and a $960,000 increase in travel, meetings and seminars expenses. Of the $14.0 million increase in personnel-related expenses, $11.3 million was attributable to increases in salaries, benefits and related expenses due primarily to increased headcount, including new hires related to the launch of our prostate cancer test in May 2013 and annual salary increases, $1.4 million was attributable to increased consulting expenses and $1.3 million was attributable to higher commission and bonus payments. The increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs is primarily due to increased selling activities related to our newly established prostate sales and marketing programs and information technology allocations for various projects related to scaling our commercial systems worldwide, as well as an increase in research and development support allocated from other functional areas for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Activities\nWe currently anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, together with payments for our tests, will be sufficient to fund our operations and facilities expansion plans for at least the next 12 months, including the expansion of our research and development programs, our proprietary liquid platforms development efforts, our efforts to expand adoption of and reimbursement for our tests and our international expansion efforts. We expect to spend approximately $24 million over the next 12 months for planned laboratory equipment, information technology and facilities expansion. We may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities will also be used to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, such as licensing technology rights, distribution arrangements for our tests both within and outside of the United States or expanding our direct sales capabilities worldwide.\n \u00b7 costs related to international expansion; \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,077 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,411 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,177 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,228 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,143 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,486 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCollaboration expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,088 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,478 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,151 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReagents and laboratory supplies\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,861 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,430 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,112 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllocated information technology, facilities and other costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,009 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,325 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,831 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,535 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,289 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,420 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n59,798 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53,076 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n64,177 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod over period dollar increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,722 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(11,101) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod over period percentage increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n31 -

We have obtained some coverage, which varies substantially from country to country, for our breast cancer test outside of the United States, including in Argentina, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In September 2013, we announced that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, in the United Kingdom issued its final guidance recommending Oncotype DX as the only multi-gene breast cancer test for use in clinical practice to guide chemotherapy treatment decisions for certain patients. We have established reimbursement with NHS England following NICE's recommendation for our breast cancer test, similar to our contracting process with U.S. insurers, and in April 2015, we began experiencing an increase in test orders from the United Kingdom. We are in the process of completing contractual arrangements with more than 100 NHS England trusts, which is necessary to begin to receive payment from each trust and recognize revenue on these tests. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we began to receive payments from NHS England trusts with whom we have completed contractual arrangements. In April 2014, we announced that the Gynecologic Oncology Working Group (AGO) in Germany updated their guidelines to recommend Oncotype DX as the only breast cancer gene expression test to predict chemotherapy benefit in early-stage, hormone receptor-positive invasive breast cancer.

In January 2010, we launched our second Oncotype DX test, the first multigene expression test developed to assess risk of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients. In late December 2011, we made Oncotype DX available for patients with DCIS, a pre-invasive form of breast cancer. In June 2012, we extended our offering of the Oncotype DX colon cancer test to patients with stage III disease treated with oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant therapy. In May 2013, we launched our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test, which is used to predict disease aggressiveness in men with low risk disease.As of February 29, 2016, the list price of our Oncotype DX breast cancer tests in the United States was $4,620, the list price of our Oncotype DX colon cancer test was $4,420 and the list price of our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test was $4,520. The substantial majority of our historical revenues have been derived from the sale of Oncotype DX breast cancer tests ordered by physicians in the United States.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-cancelable operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n38,087 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,391 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,615 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,259 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,822 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) services\nContinuing concerns over entitlement and health care reform efforts, regulatory changes and taxation issues, and geopolitical issues have contributed to uncertain expectations both for the U.S. and global economies. These factors, combined with uncertainties in business and consumer confidence and continued concerns regarding the stability of some European Union member countries, have contributed to the expectations of slower domestic and global economic growth in the near term. We periodically evaluate the impact of the economic environment on our cash management, cash collection activities and volume of tests delivered.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nSources (Uses) of Liquidity\nInternational product revenues decreased to $41.4 million or by 8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to foreign exchange rate differences which accounted for $3.1 million of the decrease, as well as the recognition in 2014 of revenue resulting from a temporary access program in the United Kingdom. International product revenues increased to $45.0 million or by 19% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d), which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for us in its first quarter of fiscal 2017, with early application permitted and, upon adoption, may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We early adopted this ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology, such as NGS, our proprietary liquid platform and continuous process improvement, and carry out clinical studies, primarily related to our ongoing work in breast, colon and prostate cancer. Research and development expenses include personnel-related expenses, reagents and\n\n \u00b7 the cost of acquiring or investing in complementary businesses or assets; \nOn a five year rotational basis, Medicare requests bids for its regional MAC services. In September 2013, the claims processing function for our jurisdiction transitioned from Palmetto GBA, to our current MAC, Noridian. Palmetto GBA under their MolDx Program is continuing to establish coverage, coding and reimbursement policies for molecular diagnostic tests performed in our jurisdiction, including our tests. The elimination of the MolDx Program or a change in the administrator of that program could impact the current coverage or payment rates for our existing tests and our ability to obtain Medicare coverage for products for which we do not yet have coverage or any products we may launch in the future, or delay payments for our tests.\nThe $5.3 million, or 10%, increase in general and administrative expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 included a $3.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $2.4 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses and a $528,000 increase in bad debt expense partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in information technology, facilities and other costs allocated to other functional areas and a $656,000 decrease in stock-based compensation. Of the $3.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, $2.2 million was attributable to increases in salaries and benefits expenses, primarily resulting from increased headcount, $1.1 million was attributable to higher contract labor and consulting expenses to support growth of our business and $286,000 was related to higher bonus payments.\nBusiness Overview\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following tables summarize accounts receivable by payor mix at December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nWe are required to make a series of fixed annual payments under a collaboration agreement beginning with a one year anniversary of achieving a key milestone for our DCIS clinical study in June 2014. As of December 31, 2015, future annual payments include payments of $604,000, and $504,000 due in 2016, and 2017, respectively.\nTest revenue recognized on an accrual basis is recorded upon delivery of each test performed, net of any contractual discount, at the amount that we expect to collect. We determine the amount we expect to collect on a per payor, per contract or arrangement basis, based on our analysis of historical average payments. This average amount is typically lower than the agreed upon amount due to several factors, such as the amount of patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payors and claim denials. We typically review our analysis annually, or at the time a contractual price change is implemented or when information comes to our attention that leads us to believe an adjustment may be warranted.\nWe determine whether revenue is recognized on an accrual basis when test results are delivered or on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor. Our revenues for tests performed are recognized on an accrual basis when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. When evaluating whether the fee is fixed or determinable and collectible, we consider whether we have sufficient history to reliably estimate the total fee that will be received from a payor and a payor's individual payment patterns. Based upon at least several months of payment history, we review the number of tests paid against the number of tests billed and the payor's outstanding balance for unpaid tests to determine whether payments are being made at a consistently high percentage of tests billed and at appropriate amounts given the arrangement or contracted payment amount. The estimated accrual amounts per test, recorded upon delivery of a patient report, are calculated for each accrual payor and are based on the arrangement or contracted price adjusted for individual payment patterns resulting from co-payment amounts and excluded services in healthcare plans.\nWe expect that international sales of our Oncotype DX tests will be heavily dependent on the availability of reimbursement and sample access. In many countries, governments are primarily responsible for reimbursing diagnostic tests. Governments often have significant discretion in determining whether a test will be reimbursed at all, and if so, on what conditions, for which other competing products, and how much will be paid. In addition, certain countries, such as China, have prohibitions against exporting tissue samples which will limit our ability to offer our tests in those countries without local laboratories or a method of test delivery which does not require samples to be transported to our U.S. laboratory.\nWe derive our revenues primarily from product sales and, to a lesser extent, from contract research arrangements. We operate in one industry segment. As of December 31, 2015, the substantial majority of our product revenues have been derived from the sale of our Oncotype DX breast cancer test. Payors are billed upon generation and delivery of test results to the physician. Product revenues are recorded on a cash basis unless a contract or arrangement to pay is in place with the payor at the time of billing and collectability is reasonably assured. Contract revenues are derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recorded as contractual obligations are completed.\nTo the extent all criteria set forth above are not met, including where there is no evidence of payment history at the time test results are delivered, product revenues are recognized on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor.\nAs of December 31, 2015, amounts outstanding for tests delivered, net of write-downs and adjustments, which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and which had not been collected totaled approximately $73.7 million. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, and to what extent these amounts will be collected.\n\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, $37.2 million, or 20%, and $34.9 million, or 19%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of accounts receivable. The $2.3 million year over year increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to increased revenues and additional payors moving from cash basis to accrual basis during 2015, partially offset by a decrease in Medicare accounts receivable. Days sales outstanding, or DSOs, is a measure of the average number of days it takes for us to collect our accounts receivable, calculated from the date that tests are billed. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our weighted average DSOs were 75 days and 78 days, respectively. The timing of our billing and cash collections may also causes fluctuations in our monthly DSOs and accounts receivable. With new unique CPT codes in place, it was necessary for payors to update their billing systems to reflect these changes, which resulted and may continue to result in payment delays and a related increase in accounts receivable balances.\nWe cannot be certain that our international expansion plans, efforts to expand adoption of and reimbursement for our tests or the development of future products will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional funds to see these activities through to a successful result. It may take years to move any one of a number of product candidates in research through development and validation to commercialization.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nTissue sample processing costs increased $5.3 million, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and $6.0 million, or 18%, in 2014 compared to 2013, driven primarily by increases in test volume of 12% in both 2015 and 2014. The increase in 2015 was also due to higher costs per test related to our prostate cancer test.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in future periods due to increased investment in our new product pipeline for breast, colon, prostate and other cancers, along with increased investment in NGS and our proprietary liquid platform.\nImpairment of Investments in Privately Held Companies\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, more than 107,030 Oncotype DX test reports were delivered for use in treatment planning, compared to more than 95,630 and 85,510 test reports delivered for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. All of our tests are conducted at our clinical reference laboratory in Redwood City, California. Our clinical reference laboratory processing capacity is currently approximately 120,000 tests annually, and has significant expansion capacity with incremental increases in laboratory personnel and equipment. The Oncotype DX breast, colon, and prostate cancer tests analyze different genes. However, all of the tests are based on a similar Oncotype DX reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR platform. We believe that we currently have sufficient capacity to process current demand for our tests.\nAs a result of historical losses and based on all current available evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that our recorded net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $228.2 million. We may incur net losses in the future, and we cannot provide assurance as to when, if ever, we will achieve sustained profitability. We expect that our research and\ndevelopment expenses, selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods and, as a result, we will need to continue to generate significant product revenues to achieve sustained profitability.\n\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $94.9 million compared to $103.7 million at December 31, 2014. The $8.8 million decrease was attributable to investments in the growth of our business, including research and development, global expansion, and activities related to reimbursement coverage of our tests partially offset by an $18.1 million investment in Invitae Corporation, or Invitae, reclassified from non-marketable securities upon Invitae's initial public offering, or IPO, in February 2015. As a publicly traded security, the market price of Invitae's common stock may be subject to volatility. For example, the price of Invitae's common stock fluctuated between $5.66 per share and $22.35 per share since the IPO in February 2015 through February 2016. In accordance with our investment policy, available cash is invested in short-term and long-term, low-risk, investment-grade debt instruments. Other than our equity investment in Invitae, our cash and marketable securities are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments including money market accounts and high-grade commercial paper and corporate bonds.\n \u00b7 the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with NGS and our proprietary liquid platform; \nEconomic Environment\nWe expect the cost of product revenues to increase in future periods as we process more tests.\nThere have also been recent and substantial changes to the payment structure for physicians, including those passed as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which was signed into law on April 16, 2015. MACRA created the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System which, beginning in 2019, more closely aligns physician payments with composite performance the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Value-based modifier program and the Electronic Health Record Meaningful Use program, and incentivizes physicians to enroll in alternative payment methods. At this time, we do not know whether these changes to the physician payment systems will have any impact on orders or payments for our tests.\nrelated expenses, $4.0 million was attributable to higher contract labor and consulting expenses to support growth of our business, $233,000 was attributable to an increase in bonus expense and $74,000 was attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits expenses.\nApproximately $211.7 million, or 74%, of product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, was recorded on an accrual basis and recognized at the time the test results were delivered, compared to $199.9 million, or 73%, and $185.7 million, or 72%, of product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For all periods, the balance of product revenues was recognized upon cash collection as payments were received. The timing of recognition of revenues related to third-party payors may cause fluctuations in product revenues from period to period.\nHistorically we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and cash received in payment for our tests. Certain purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements have been partially financed through capital equipment financing arrangements.\nProduct revenues related to Medicare patients for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $58.9 million, or 20%, of product revenues, compared to $55.9 million, or 20%, and $54.4 million, or 21%, of product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No other third-party payors comprised product revenues of 10% or more for those years.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nRevenues\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11.8 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.3 million and $8.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities includes net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflected a net loss of $33.3 million, adjusted for $23.1 million of depreciation and stock-based compensation expense and a $4.5 million increase in accrued compensation expense and employee benefits partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, a $2.2 million increase in accounts receivable, a $1.5 million deferred tax benefit generated from unrealized gain recognized on available-for-sale marketable securities and a $1.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nIn connection with the May 2013 launch of our prostate cancer test, we have expanded our clinical laboratory processing capacity. We expect our continued commercialization efforts of our prostate cancer test will result in increased costs for laboratory testing, including staffing-related costs, incremental sales and marketing personnel to introduce our product to a new group of physicians and patients, costs for clinical utility studies and costs associated with obtaining reimbursement coverage.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe have also committed to make potential future payments to third parties as part of our collaboration and licensing agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of specific project milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is generally neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such commitments have not been included in the table above.\nSales of our tests in the United States and other countries are dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Market acceptance of our tests has and will continue to depend upon the ability to obtain an appropriate level of coverage for, and reimbursement from, third-party payors for our tests. We have had Medicare coverage for our Oncotype DX invasive breast cancer test since 2006 and for our Oncotype DX colon cancer test since 2011. In October 2015, we obtained Medicare coverage for our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test for patients with low and very-low risk. Under the terms of the coverage determination for our prostate cancer test, reimbursement is limited to tests ordered by physicians who agree to participate in a Certification Training Registry and to provide certain information about Medicare beneficiaries who receive our test.\nOur non-cancelable operating lease obligations are for laboratory and office space. We lease various facilities in Redwood City, California, totaling 180,700 square feet. The lease terms expire between March 2021 and March 2023, each with an option for us to extend the terms of the lease for an additional five years. In November 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 31,200 square feet of laboratory and office space in a nearby location. We do not currently occupy this property, however, we have included the square footage in the total leased space in Redwood City stated above. We also lease 7,500 square feet of space in Geneva, Switzerland. This lease expires in May 2021.\n \u00b7 costs related to acquiring or achieving access to tissue samples and technologies; \nThe healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs. The effect of the implementation of the ACA on our business is uncertain. Among other things, the law requires medical device manufacturers to pay a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices that are listed with the FDA starting in January 2013; this tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, but is scheduled for re-imposition in 2018. Although the FDA has issued draft guidance that, if finalized, would regulate certain clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use, referred to as LDTs, as medical devices, none of our LDTs, such as our Oncotype DX breast, colon and prostate cancer tests, are currently listed with the FDA. We cannot assure you that the tax will not apply to services such as ours in the future.\n\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:\nRevenue Recognition\n \u00b7 the impact of changes in Federal, state and international taxation; and \nThe $4.7 million, or 8%, increase in general and administrative expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 included a $4.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $2.5 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses, a $1.5 million increase in professional fees and other expenses and a $601,000 increase in billing and collections fees partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in information technology, facilities and other costs allocated to other functional areas, a $726,000 decrease in bad debt expense and a $350,000 decrease in stock-based compensation. Of the $4.3 million increase in personnel-\nWe recorded a net loss of $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net losses of $24.6 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. On a basic and diluted per share basis, net loss per share was $1.03, $0.78 and $0.42 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We may incur net losses in future periods due to future spending and fluctuations in our business, and we may not achieve or maintain sustained profitability in the future.\nFrom time to time, we receive requests for refunds of payments, generally due to overpayments made by third-party payors. Upon becoming aware of a refund request, we establish an accrued liability for tests covered by the refund request until such time as we determine whether or not a refund is due. If we determine that a refund is due, we credit cash and reduce the accrued liability. Accrued refunds were $609,000 and $944,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nsupplies used in research and development laboratory work, infrastructure expenses, including allocated overhead and facility occupancy costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies.\nThe $5.7 million, or 4% increase in selling and marketing expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to U.S. and international sales and operations support and included a $3.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $2.2 million increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs, a $912,000 increase in travel, meetings and seminars and an $869,000 increase in other costs partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in promotional and marketing materials and a $296,000 decrease in stock-based compensation. Of the $3.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, $1.6 million was attributable to increases in salaries, benefits and related expenses due primarily to increased headcount, including new hires related to the launch of our prostate cancer test in May 2013 and annual salary increases, $1.6 million was attributable to higher commission and bonus payments and $112,000 was attributable to increased consulting expenses. The increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs is primarily due to increased selling activities related to our newly established prostate sales and marketing programs and information technology allocations for various projects related to scaling our commercial systems worldwide, as well as an increase in research and development support allocated from other functional areas for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe year over year increases in product revenues resulted, in part, from increased adoption. Test volume increased by 12% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Of the growth in test volume, approximately 4% was from prostate cancer tests delivered and 8% was from breast cancer tests delivered worldwide. Test volume increased by 12% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Test volume increases exceeded revenue increases primarily due to our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test, which had not yet have established reimbursement until October 2015, and tests from certain international markets where we have not yet established reimbursement. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar in 2015 resulted in a negative impact on product revenues as described below.\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, occupancy and equipment expenses, including rent and depreciation expenses, billing and collection fees, bad debt expense, professional fees and other expenses, including intellectual property defense and prosecution costs, and other administrative costs, partially offset by cost allocations to our commercial laboratory operations, research and development, and sales and marketing functions, including allocated information technology and facility occupancy costs.\nWe accrue an allowance for doubtful accounts against our accounts receivable based on estimates consistent with historical payment experience. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated quarterly and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate. Historically, the amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable that have been written off have been consistent with management's expectations. We cannot assure you that we will not experience higher than expected write-offs in the future. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information, including a summary of accounts receivable aging by payor mix.\nContractual Obligations\nAccounts Receivable\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs our international business expands, our financial results become more sensitive to the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, in countries where we have a direct commercial presence, our tests are sold in local currency, which results in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting our U.S.-dollar reported revenues. In other markets where we sell our tests in U.S. dollars to distribution partners, the demand for our tests may be impacted by the change in U.S. dollar exchange rates affecting partners' costs or local market price adjustments.\nThere were no contract revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Contract revenues were $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and represented studies assessing our gene expression technology or collaborative work in gene selection and protocol design with our pharmaceutical partners. The decrease in contract revenues\nWe enter into exclusive distribution agreements for the sale of one or more of our Oncotype DX tests with distributors outside of the United States. In these countries, the distributor generally provides us with certain marketing and administrative services within its territory. As a condition of these agreements, the distributor generally pays us an agreed upon fee per test and we process the tests. The same revenue recognition criteria described above generally apply to tests delivered through distributors. To the extent all criteria set forth above are not met when test results are delivered, product revenues are generally recognized when cash is received from the distributor.\nWe expect selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in future periods due to our efforts to establish adoption of and reimbursement for our new products, continued investment in our global commercial infrastructure and increases in our sales force.\nCost of product revenues represents the cost of materials, direct labor, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing tissue samples (including sample accessioning, histopathology, anatomical pathology, paraffin extraction, RT-PCR, quality control analyses and shipping charges to transport tissue samples) and license fees. Infrastructure expenses include allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs. Costs associated with performing our tests are recorded as tests are processed. Costs recorded for tissue sample processing represent the cost of all the tests processed during the period regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test. Royalties for licensed technology calculated as a percentage of product revenues and fixed annual payments relating to the launch and commercialization of Oncotype DX tests are recorded as license fees in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized or in accordance with other contractual obligations. While license fees are generally calculated as a percentage of product revenues, the percentage increase in license fees does not correlate exactly to the percentage increase in product revenues because certain agreements contain provisions for fixed annual payments and other agreements have tiered rates and payments that may be capped at annual minimum or maximum amounts. License fees represent a significant component of our cost of product revenues and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.\n \u00b7 the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with expansion of our current tests and the development of new tests; \nWe are a global healthcare company that provides clinically-actionable genomic information to personalize cancer treatment. We develop and globally commercialize genomic-based clinical laboratory services that analyze the underlying biology of cancer, allowing physicians and patients to make individualized treatment decisions. We are translating significant amounts of genomic data that will be useful for treatment planning throughout the cancer patient's journey, from diagnosis to treatment selection and monitoring. We offer our Oncotype DX tests as a clinical laboratory service, where we analyze the expression levels of genes in tumor tissue samples and provide physicians with a quantitative gene expression profile expressed as a single quantitative score, which we call a Recurrence Score for invasive breast cancer and colon cancer, a DCIS Score for ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, and a Genomic Prostate Score, or GPS, for prostate cancer\n \u00b7 costs related to filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; \nNet cash provided by in investing activities was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $14.2 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our investing activities have consisted predominantly of purchases and maturities of marketable securities and capital expenditures. Net cash provided by investing activities of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $29.7 million in net maturity of marketable securities and $23.5 million in capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures primarily reflects additional investments in a new enterprise resource planning system. Capital expenditures included $15.1 million of internal-use software development in the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities of $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $10.5 million of capital expenditures, a $2.0 million investment in privately held companies and $1.9 million in net purchase of marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities of $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $11.0 million in capital expenditures and $5.0 million investment in privately held companies, partially offset by $9.0 million in net maturities of marketable securities.\nThe $6.7 million, or 13%, increase in research and development expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a one-time $5.5 million expense for the wind-down of a license agreement and development program. Exclusive of this one-time expense, research and development expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 increased by $1.2 million primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in personnel-related expense, a $431,000 increase in reagents and laboratory supplies and an $85,000 increase stock-based compensation partially offset by an $890,000 decrease in collaboration expenses, a $754,000 decrease in other costs and a $316,000 decrease in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs.\nOther expense, net was $498,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to other expense, net of $764,000 and $158,000 for the years ended December 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was primarily related to $551,000, $790,000 and $158,000 of net foreign currency transaction losses, respectively, resulting from valuation adjustments to our international accounts receivable balance. We expect other income (expense), net to continue to fluctuate based on fluctuations in exchange rates that impact our foreign exchange transaction gains and losses.\nAs of the date of this report, we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our short-term marketable securities, and we expect that we will continue to be able to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities. We periodically monitor the financial position of our significant third-party payors, which include Medicare and managed care companies. As of the date of this report, we do not expect the current economic environment to have a material negative impact on our ability to collect payments from third-party payors in the foreseeable future. We believe the economic environment and changes in the healthcare system continued to impact product payment cycles, growth in tests delivered and product revenue generated during the year ended December 31, 2015. We intend to continue to assess the impact of the economic environment on our business activities. If the economic environment does not improve or deteriorates, our business including our patient population, government and third-party payors and our distributors and suppliers could be negatively affected, resulting in a negative impact on our product revenues.\nThe amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, such as the amount of cash provided by our operations, the progress of our commercialization efforts, product development, regulatory requirements, progress in reimbursement for our tests and available strategic opportunities for acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products.\nOperating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 costs associated with acquiring, licensing or investing in technologies, including NGS and our proprietary liquid platform; \n \u00b7 costs associated with expanding our commercial and laboratory operations, including our selling and marketing efforts; \nThe $11.1 million, or 17%, decrease in research and development expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 included a $7.7 million decrease in collaboration expense, a $7.5 million decrease in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs, a $682,000 decrease in reagents and laboratory supplies and a $343,000 decrease in stock-based compensation partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in other costs and a $2.2 million increase in personnel-related expenses. The $7.7 million decrease in collaboration and licensing expenses was primarily due to a $9.0 million up-front payment in 2013 under a licensing agreement.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe have continued to expand our business, both in the United States and internationally. We currently plan to continue to use substantially the same business model internationally as we use in the United States, however, there are significant differences between countries that need to be considered. For example, operational requirements generally vary from country to country, and different countries may have a public healthcare system, a combination of public and private healthcare system or a cash-based payment system. We have a direct commercial presence with employees in Canada, Japan and certain European counties, including our European headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Additionally, we have exclusive distribution agreements for the sale of our breast and colon cancer tests with distributors covering more than 90 countries outside of the United States.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of this report. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nCash Flows\nThe increase in personnel-related expenses for 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits due to increased headcount to support the launch of our prostate cancer test, as well as projects related to our product pipeline and ongoing work in NGS and our proprietary platform for liquid biopsy tests. The decrease in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs is primarily due to preparing for our prostate cancer product launch in 2013, which included project work from our various information technology groups, allocated based on specific development projects, as well as capitalization of certain costs of project work from our various information technology groups, allocated based on specific development projects in 2015.\nfor 2015 and 2014 compared to 2013 was due to a decrease in activities with collaboration partners. The contract revenues for 2013 included $1.5 million of contract revenue recognized in the fourth quarter upon completion of clinical validation work for Pfizer Inc. We expect that our contract revenues will continue to fluctuate based on the number and timing of studies being conducted.\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nInterest income was $221,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $192,000 and $222,000 for years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect our interest income will remain nominal if the current low interest rate environment continues.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we hire additional staff and incur other expenses to support the growth of our business, and to the extent we spend more on both billing and collections fees and bad debt expense.\n \u00b7 the rate of progress in establishing and maintaining reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international third-party payors; \nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.\n \u00b7 the effect of competing technological and market developments; \n\nCost of Product Revenues\nWe depend upon third-party payors, both public and private, to provide reimbursement for our tests. Accordingly, we have and expect to continue to focus substantial resources on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement coverage from third-party payors.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $8.4 million and $13.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our financing activities included sales of our equity securities and repurchases of our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 comprises $12.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchased pursuant to our ESPP, partially offset by cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $3.8 million related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and awards. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 comprises $12.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchased pursuant to our ESPP, partially offset by cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $3.6 million related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and awards. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $16.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchased pursuant to our ESPP, partially offset by cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $2.8 million related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and awards.\nHealthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures are being adopted in the U.S. and in many foreign countries. These reforms and measures, including those envisioned by the adoption in 2010 of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, could among other things limit the use of our tests and reduce reimbursement. We also expect that pricing of medical products and services will remain under pressure as alternative payment models such as bundling, value-based purchasing and accountable care organizations develop in the United States.\n \u00b7 costs related to future product launches; \nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) to provide guidance on revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Income\nContract revenues are generally derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recognized on a contract-specific basis. Under certain contracts, revenues are recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed. We may exercise judgment when estimating full-time equivalent level of effort, costs incurred and time to project completion. For certain contracts, we utilize the performance-based method of revenue recognition, which requires that we estimate the total amount of costs to be expended for a project and recognize revenue equal to the portion of costs expended to date. The estimated total costs to be expended are necessarily subject to revision from time-to-time as the underlying facts and circumstances change.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement ( ASU 2015-05\u201d). This amendment provides guidance to help entities determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software or as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, an entity has the option to apply the provisions of ASU 2015-05 either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified, or retrospectively. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-05 to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, education and promotional expenses, market analysis and development expenses and infrastructure expenses, including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs. These expenses include the costs of educating physicians, laboratory personnel and other healthcare professionals regarding our genomic technologies, how our Oncotype DX tests are developed and validated and the value of the quantitative information that our tests provide. Selling and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education, medical meeting participation and dissemination of scientific and economic publications related to our Oncotype DX tests. Our sales force compensation includes annual salaries and eligibility for quarterly commissions based on the achievement of predetermined sales goals and other management objectives.\n \u00b7 the rate of progress and cost of selling and marketing activities associated with expanding adoption of our Oncotype DX colon and prostate cancer and DCIS tests; \nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-2, Leases ( ASU 2016-2\u201d). ASU 2016-2 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. ASU 2016-2 is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019, and all annual and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-2 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n \u00b7 costs and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products or operations; \nU.S. Healthcare Environment\nIf we are not able to generate and maintain sustained product revenues to finance our cash requirements, we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders may result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our product or market development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses", "item_7_text": "Net cash provided by operating activities of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflected a net loss of $24.6 million, adjusted for $23.4 million of depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, a $3.8 million increase in accrued compensation expense and employee benefits, a $3.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, a $985,000 increase in accounts payable and a $741,000 decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in accounts receivable. Net cash provided by operating activities of $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflected net loss of $12.8 million, adjusted for $23.8 million of depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, a $1.9 million increase in accrued compensation expense and employee benefits, a $1.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, a $1.2 million increase in accounts payable and a $643,000 increase in impairment on investments, partially offset by a $7.2 million increase in accounts receivable.\n \u00b7 the economic and other terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter or investments or acquisitions we might seek to effect. \n \u00b7 costs associated with acquiring or investing in complementary businesses or assets; \nThe $25.1 million, or 22%, increase in selling and marketing expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to U.S. and international sales and operations support and included a $14.0 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $7.0 million increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs, a $1.5 million increase in collaboration expenses, a $1.2 million increase in promotional and marketing materials and a $960,000 increase in travel, meetings and seminars expenses. Of the $14.0 million increase in personnel-related expenses, $11.3 million was attributable to increases in salaries, benefits and related expenses due primarily to increased headcount, including new hires related to the launch of our prostate cancer test in May 2013 and annual salary increases, $1.4 million was attributable to increased consulting expenses and $1.3 million was attributable to higher commission and bonus payments. The increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs is primarily due to increased selling activities related to our newly established prostate sales and marketing programs and information technology allocations for various projects related to scaling our commercial systems worldwide, as well as an increase in research and development support allocated from other functional areas for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Activities\nWe currently anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, together with payments for our tests, will be sufficient to fund our operations and facilities expansion plans for at least the next 12 months, including the expansion of our research and development programs, our proprietary liquid platforms development efforts, our efforts to expand adoption of and reimbursement for our tests and our international expansion efforts. We expect to spend approximately $24 million over the next 12 months for planned laboratory equipment, information technology and facilities expansion. We may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities will also be used to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, such as licensing technology rights, distribution arrangements for our tests both within and outside of the United States or expanding our direct sales capabilities worldwide.\n \u00b7 costs related to international expansion; \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nThe majority of our international Oncotype DX breast and colon cancer test revenues come from direct payor reimbursement, payments from our distributors, patient self-pay, and clinical collaborations in various countries. We have obtained some coverage, which varies substantially from country to country, for our breast cancer test outside of the United States, including in Argentina, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In September 2013, we announced that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, in the United Kingdom issued its final guidance recommending Oncotype DX as the only multi-gene breast cancer test for use in clinical practice to guide chemotherapy treatment decisions for certain patients. We have established reimbursement with NHS England following NICE's recommendation for our breast cancer test, similar to our contracting process with U.S. insurers, and in April 2015, we began experiencing an increase in test orders from the United Kingdom. We are in the process of completing contractual arrangements with more than 100 NHS England trusts, which is necessary to begin to receive payment from each trust and recognize revenue on these tests. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we began to receive payments from NHS England trusts with whom we have completed contractual arrangements. In April 2014, we announced that the Gynecologic Oncology Working Group (AGO) in Germany updated their guidelines to recommend Oncotype DX as the only breast cancer gene expression test to predict chemotherapy benefit in early-stage, hormone receptor-positive invasive breast cancer. We expect that it will take several years to establish broad coverage and reimbursement for our Oncotype DX breast, colon and prostate cancer tests with payors in countries outside of the United States and there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful.\nIn addition, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA includes a substantial new payment system for certain clinical laboratory tests that is scheduled to be effective starting in 2017. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenues from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule will be required to report every three years (or annually for advanced diagnostic laboratory tests\u201d), private payor payment rates and volumes for their tests. CMS will use the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for the tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates for the tests.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded an income tax benefit of $996,000 and income tax expense of $393,000 and $346,000, respectively. The 2015 benefit is principally comprised of a federal deferred tax benefit generated by the unrealized gain recognized in other comprehensive income during the year on available-for-sales securities reduced by income tax expense in our foreign jurisdictions. The 2014 and 2013 tax expense is principally comprised of foreign income tax and miscellaneous state income tax.\nEach of our equity investments is reviewed at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment might not be recoverable. At December 31, 2013, we concluded that the indicators of impairment of our investment in a privately held company were other than temporary, and therefore wrote off the remaining asset balance of $643,000. There was no additional impairment recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nIn January 2004, we launched our first Oncotype DX test, which is used to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit in early stage invasive breast cancer patients. In January 2010, we launched our second Oncotype DX test, the first multigene expression test developed to assess risk of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients. In late December 2011, we made Oncotype DX available for patients with DCIS, a pre-invasive form of breast cancer. In June 2012, we extended our offering of the Oncotype DX colon cancer test to patients with stage III disease treated with oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant therapy. In May 2013, we launched our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test, which is used to predict disease aggressiveness in men with low risk disease.As of February 29, 2016, the list price of our Oncotype DX breast cancer tests in the United States was $4,620, the list price of our Oncotype DX colon cancer test was $4,420 and the list price of our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test was $4,520. The substantial majority of our historical revenues have been derived from the sale of Oncotype DX breast cancer tests ordered by physicians in the United States.\nChanges in Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) services\nContinuing concerns over entitlement and health care reform efforts, regulatory changes and taxation issues, and geopolitical issues have contributed to uncertain expectations both for the U.S. and global economies. These factors, combined with uncertainties in business and consumer confidence and continued concerns regarding the stability of some European Union member countries, have contributed to the expectations of slower domestic and global economic growth in the near term. We periodically evaluate the impact of the economic environment on our cash management, cash collection activities and volume of tests delivered.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nSources (Uses) of Liquidity\nInternational product revenues decreased to $41.4 million or by 8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to foreign exchange rate differences which accounted for $3.1 million of the decrease, as well as the recognition in 2014 of revenue resulting from a temporary access program in the United Kingdom. International product revenues increased to $45.0 million or by 19% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d), which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for us in its first quarter of fiscal 2017, with early application permitted and, upon adoption, may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We early adopted this ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology, such as NGS, our proprietary liquid platform and continuous process improvement, and carry out clinical studies, primarily related to our ongoing work in breast, colon and prostate cancer. Research and development expenses include personnel-related expenses, reagents and\n\n \u00b7 the cost of acquiring or investing in complementary businesses or assets; \nOn a five year rotational basis, Medicare requests bids for its regional MAC services. In September 2013, the claims processing function for our jurisdiction transitioned from Palmetto GBA, to our current MAC, Noridian. Palmetto GBA under their MolDx Program is continuing to establish coverage, coding and reimbursement policies for molecular diagnostic tests performed in our jurisdiction, including our tests. The elimination of the MolDx Program or a change in the administrator of that program could impact the current coverage or payment rates for our existing tests and our ability to obtain Medicare coverage for products for which we do not yet have coverage or any products we may launch in the future, or delay payments for our tests.\nThe $5.3 million, or 10%, increase in general and administrative expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 included a $3.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $2.4 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses and a $528,000 increase in bad debt expense partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in information technology, facilities and other costs allocated to other functional areas and a $656,000 decrease in stock-based compensation. Of the $3.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, $2.2 million was attributable to increases in salaries and benefits expenses, primarily resulting from increased headcount, $1.1 million was attributable to higher contract labor and consulting expenses to support growth of our business and $286,000 was related to higher bonus payments.\nBusiness Overview\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following tables summarize accounts receivable by payor mix at December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nWe are required to make a series of fixed annual payments under a collaboration agreement beginning with a one year anniversary of achieving a key milestone for our DCIS clinical study in June 2014. As of December 31, 2015, future annual payments include payments of $604,000, and $504,000 due in 2016, and 2017, respectively.\nTest revenue recognized on an accrual basis is recorded upon delivery of each test performed, net of any contractual discount, at the amount that we expect to collect. We determine the amount we expect to collect on a per payor, per contract or arrangement basis, based on our analysis of historical average payments. This average amount is typically lower than the agreed upon amount due to several factors, such as the amount of patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payors and claim denials. We typically review our analysis annually, or at the time a contractual price change is implemented or when information comes to our attention that leads us to believe an adjustment may be warranted.\nWe determine whether revenue is recognized on an accrual basis when test results are delivered or on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor. Our revenues for tests performed are recognized on an accrual basis when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. When evaluating whether the fee is fixed or determinable and collectible, we consider whether we have sufficient history to reliably estimate the total fee that will be received from a payor and a payor's individual payment patterns. Based upon at least several months of payment history, we review the number of tests paid against the number of tests billed and the payor's outstanding balance for unpaid tests to determine whether payments are being made at a consistently high percentage of tests billed and at appropriate amounts given the arrangement or contracted payment amount. The estimated accrual amounts per test, recorded upon delivery of a patient report, are calculated for each accrual payor and are based on the arrangement or contracted price adjusted for individual payment patterns resulting from co-payment amounts and excluded services in healthcare plans.\nWe expect that international sales of our Oncotype DX tests will be heavily dependent on the availability of reimbursement and sample access. In many countries, governments are primarily responsible for reimbursing diagnostic tests. Governments often have significant discretion in determining whether a test will be reimbursed at all, and if so, on what conditions, for which other competing products, and how much will be paid. In addition, certain countries, such as China, have prohibitions against exporting tissue samples which will limit our ability to offer our tests in those countries without local laboratories or a method of test delivery which does not require samples to be transported to our U.S. laboratory.\nWe derive our revenues primarily from product sales and, to a lesser extent, from contract research arrangements. We operate in one industry segment. As of December 31, 2015, the substantial majority of our product revenues have been derived from the sale of our Oncotype DX breast cancer test. Payors are billed upon generation and delivery of test results to the physician. Product revenues are recorded on a cash basis unless a contract or arrangement to pay is in place with the payor at the time of billing and collectability is reasonably assured. Contract revenues are derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recorded as contractual obligations are completed.\nTo the extent all criteria set forth above are not met, including where there is no evidence of payment history at the time test results are delivered, product revenues are recognized on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor.\nAs of December 31, 2015, amounts outstanding for tests delivered, net of write-downs and adjustments, which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and which had not been collected totaled approximately $73.7 million. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, and to what extent these amounts will be collected.\n\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, $37.2 million, or 20%, and $34.9 million, or 19%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of accounts receivable. The $2.3 million year over year increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to increased revenues and additional payors moving from cash basis to accrual basis during 2015, partially offset by a decrease in Medicare accounts receivable. Days sales outstanding, or DSOs, is a measure of the average number of days it takes for us to collect our accounts receivable, calculated from the date that tests are billed. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our weighted average DSOs were 75 days and 78 days, respectively. The timing of our billing and cash collections may also causes fluctuations in our monthly DSOs and accounts receivable. With new unique CPT codes in place, it was necessary for payors to update their billing systems to reflect these changes, which resulted and may continue to result in payment delays and a related increase in accounts receivable balances.\nWe cannot be certain that our international expansion plans, efforts to expand adoption of and reimbursement for our tests or the development of future products will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional funds to see these activities through to a successful result. It may take years to move any one of a number of product candidates in research through development and validation to commercialization.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nTissue sample processing costs increased $5.3 million, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and $6.0 million, or 18%, in 2014 compared to 2013, driven primarily by increases in test volume of 12% in both 2015 and 2014. The increase in 2015 was also due to higher costs per test related to our prostate cancer test.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in future periods due to increased investment in our new product pipeline for breast, colon, prostate and other cancers, along with increased investment in NGS and our proprietary liquid platform.\nImpairment of Investments in Privately Held Companies\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, more than 107,030 Oncotype DX test reports were delivered for use in treatment planning, compared to more than 95,630 and 85,510 test reports delivered for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. All of our tests are conducted at our clinical reference laboratory in Redwood City, California. Our clinical reference laboratory processing capacity is currently approximately 120,000 tests annually, and has significant expansion capacity with incremental increases in laboratory personnel and equipment. The Oncotype DX breast, colon, and prostate cancer tests analyze different genes. However, all of the tests are based on a similar Oncotype DX reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR platform. We believe that we currently have sufficient capacity to process current demand for our tests.\nAs a result of historical losses and based on all current available evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that our recorded net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $228.2 million. We may incur net losses in the future, and we cannot provide assurance as to when, if ever, we will achieve sustained profitability. We expect that our research and\ndevelopment expenses, selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods and, as a result, we will need to continue to generate significant product revenues to achieve sustained profitability.\n\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $94.9 million compared to $103.7 million at December 31, 2014. The $8.8 million decrease was attributable to investments in the growth of our business, including research and development, global expansion, and activities related to reimbursement coverage of our tests partially offset by an $18.1 million investment in Invitae Corporation, or Invitae, reclassified from non-marketable securities upon Invitae's initial public offering, or IPO, in February 2015. As a publicly traded security, the market price of Invitae's common stock may be subject to volatility. For example, the price of Invitae's common stock fluctuated between $5.66 per share and $22.35 per share since the IPO in February 2015 through February 2016. In accordance with our investment policy, available cash is invested in short-term and long-term, low-risk, investment-grade debt instruments. Other than our equity investment in Invitae, our cash and marketable securities are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments including money market accounts and high-grade commercial paper and corporate bonds.\n \u00b7 the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with NGS and our proprietary liquid platform; \nEconomic Environment\nWe expect the cost of product revenues to increase in future periods as we process more tests.\nThere have also been recent and substantial changes to the payment structure for physicians, including those passed as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which was signed into law on April 16, 2015. MACRA created the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System which, beginning in 2019, more closely aligns physician payments with composite performance the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Value-based modifier program and the Electronic Health Record Meaningful Use program, and incentivizes physicians to enroll in alternative payment methods. At this time, we do not know whether these changes to the physician payment systems will have any impact on orders or payments for our tests.\nrelated expenses, $4.0 million was attributable to higher contract labor and consulting expenses to support growth of our business, $233,000 was attributable to an increase in bonus expense and $74,000 was attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits expenses.\nApproximately $211.7 million, or 74%, of product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, was recorded on an accrual basis and recognized at the time the test results were delivered, compared to $199.9 million, or 73%, and $185.7 million, or 72%, of product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For all periods, the balance of product revenues was recognized upon cash collection as payments were received. The timing of recognition of revenues related to third-party payors may cause fluctuations in product revenues from period to period.\nHistorically we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and cash received in payment for our tests. Certain purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements have been partially financed through capital equipment financing arrangements.\nProduct revenues related to Medicare patients for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $58.9 million, or 20%, of product revenues, compared to $55.9 million, or 20%, and $54.4 million, or 21%, of product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No other third-party payors comprised product revenues of 10% or more for those years.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nRevenues\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11.8 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.3 million and $8.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities includes net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflected a net loss of $33.3 million, adjusted for $23.1 million of depreciation and stock-based compensation expense and a $4.5 million increase in accrued compensation expense and employee benefits partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, a $2.2 million increase in accounts receivable, a $1.5 million deferred tax benefit generated from unrealized gain recognized on available-for-sale marketable securities and a $1.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nIn connection with the May 2013 launch of our prostate cancer test, we have expanded our clinical laboratory processing capacity. We expect our continued commercialization efforts of our prostate cancer test will result in increased costs for laboratory testing, including staffing-related costs, incremental sales and marketing personnel to introduce our product to a new group of physicians and patients, costs for clinical utility studies and costs associated with obtaining reimbursement coverage.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe have also committed to make potential future payments to third parties as part of our collaboration and licensing agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of specific project milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is generally neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such commitments have not been included in the table above.\nSales of our tests in the United States and other countries are dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Market acceptance of our tests has and will continue to depend upon the ability to obtain an appropriate level of coverage for, and reimbursement from, third-party payors for our tests. We have had Medicare coverage for our Oncotype DX invasive breast cancer test since 2006 and for our Oncotype DX colon cancer test since 2011. In October 2015, we obtained Medicare coverage for our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test for patients with low and very-low risk. Under the terms of the coverage determination for our prostate cancer test, reimbursement is limited to tests ordered by physicians who agree to participate in a Certification Training Registry and to provide certain information about Medicare beneficiaries who receive our test.\nOur non-cancelable operating lease obligations are for laboratory and office space. We lease various facilities in Redwood City, California, totaling 180,700 square feet. The lease terms expire between March 2021 and March 2023, each with an option for us to extend the terms of the lease for an additional five years. In November 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 31,200 square feet of laboratory and office space in a nearby location. We do not currently occupy this property, however, we have included the square footage in the total leased space in Redwood City stated above. We also lease 7,500 square feet of space in Geneva, Switzerland. This lease expires in May 2021.\n \u00b7 costs related to acquiring or achieving access to tissue samples and technologies; \nThe healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs. The effect of the implementation of the ACA on our business is uncertain. Among other things, the law requires medical device manufacturers to pay a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices that are listed with the FDA starting in January 2013; this tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, but is scheduled for re-imposition in 2018. Although the FDA has issued draft guidance that, if finalized, would regulate certain clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use, referred to as LDTs, as medical devices, none of our LDTs, such as our Oncotype DX breast, colon and prostate cancer tests, are currently listed with the FDA. We cannot assure you that the tax will not apply to services such as ours in the future.\n\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:\nRevenue Recognition\n \u00b7 the impact of changes in Federal, state and international taxation; and \nThe $4.7 million, or 8%, increase in general and administrative expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 included a $4.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $2.5 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses, a $1.5 million increase in professional fees and other expenses and a $601,000 increase in billing and collections fees partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in information technology, facilities and other costs allocated to other functional areas, a $726,000 decrease in bad debt expense and a $350,000 decrease in stock-based compensation. Of the $4.3 million increase in personnel-\nWe recorded a net loss of $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net losses of $24.6 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. On a basic and diluted per share basis, net loss per share was $1.03, $0.78 and $0.42 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We may incur net losses in future periods due to future spending and fluctuations in our business, and we may not achieve or maintain sustained profitability in the future.\nFrom time to time, we receive requests for refunds of payments, generally due to overpayments made by third-party payors. Upon becoming aware of a refund request, we establish an accrued liability for tests covered by the refund request until such time as we determine whether or not a refund is due. If we determine that a refund is due, we credit cash and reduce the accrued liability. Accrued refunds were $609,000 and $944,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nsupplies used in research and development laboratory work, infrastructure expenses, including allocated overhead and facility occupancy costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies.\nThe $5.7 million, or 4% increase in selling and marketing expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to U.S. and international sales and operations support and included a $3.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a $2.2 million increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs, a $912,000 increase in travel, meetings and seminars and an $869,000 increase in other costs partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in promotional and marketing materials and a $296,000 decrease in stock-based compensation. Of the $3.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, $1.6 million was attributable to increases in salaries, benefits and related expenses due primarily to increased headcount, including new hires related to the launch of our prostate cancer test in May 2013 and annual salary increases, $1.6 million was attributable to higher commission and bonus payments and $112,000 was attributable to increased consulting expenses. The increase in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs is primarily due to increased selling activities related to our newly established prostate sales and marketing programs and information technology allocations for various projects related to scaling our commercial systems worldwide, as well as an increase in research and development support allocated from other functional areas for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe year over year increases in product revenues resulted, in part, from increased adoption. Test volume increased by 12% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Of the growth in test volume, approximately 4% was from prostate cancer tests delivered and 8% was from breast cancer tests delivered worldwide. Test volume increased by 12% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Test volume increases exceeded revenue increases primarily due to our Oncotype DX prostate cancer test, which had not yet have established reimbursement until October 2015, and tests from certain international markets where we have not yet established reimbursement. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar in 2015 resulted in a negative impact on product revenues as described below.\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, occupancy and equipment expenses, including rent and depreciation expenses, billing and collection fees, bad debt expense, professional fees and other expenses, including intellectual property defense and prosecution costs, and other administrative costs, partially offset by cost allocations to our commercial laboratory operations, research and development, and sales and marketing functions, including allocated information technology and facility occupancy costs.\nWe accrue an allowance for doubtful accounts against our accounts receivable based on estimates consistent with historical payment experience. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated quarterly and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate. Historically, the amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable that have been written off have been consistent with management's expectations. We cannot assure you that we will not experience higher than expected write-offs in the future. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information, including a summary of accounts receivable aging by payor mix.\nContractual Obligations\nAccounts Receivable\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs our international business expands, our financial results become more sensitive to the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, in countries where we have a direct commercial presence, our tests are sold in local currency, which results in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting our U.S.-dollar reported revenues. In other markets where we sell our tests in U.S. dollars to distribution partners, the demand for our tests may be impacted by the change in U.S. dollar exchange rates affecting partners' costs or local market price adjustments.\nThere were no contract revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Contract revenues were $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and represented studies assessing our gene expression technology or collaborative work in gene selection and protocol design with our pharmaceutical partners. The decrease in contract revenues\nWe enter into exclusive distribution agreements for the sale of one or more of our Oncotype DX tests with distributors outside of the United States. In these countries, the distributor generally provides us with certain marketing and administrative services within its territory. As a condition of these agreements, the distributor generally pays us an agreed upon fee per test and we process the tests. The same revenue recognition criteria described above generally apply to tests delivered through distributors. To the extent all criteria set forth above are not met when test results are delivered, product revenues are generally recognized when cash is received from the distributor.\nWe expect selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in future periods due to our efforts to establish adoption of and reimbursement for our new products, continued investment in our global commercial infrastructure and increases in our sales force.\nCost of product revenues represents the cost of materials, direct labor, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing tissue samples (including sample accessioning, histopathology, anatomical pathology, paraffin extraction, RT-PCR, quality control analyses and shipping charges to transport tissue samples) and license fees. Infrastructure expenses include allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs. Costs associated with performing our tests are recorded as tests are processed. Costs recorded for tissue sample processing represent the cost of all the tests processed during the period regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test. Royalties for licensed technology calculated as a percentage of product revenues and fixed annual payments relating to the launch and commercialization of Oncotype DX tests are recorded as license fees in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized or in accordance with other contractual obligations. While license fees are generally calculated as a percentage of product revenues, the percentage increase in license fees does not correlate exactly to the percentage increase in product revenues because certain agreements contain provisions for fixed annual payments and other agreements have tiered rates and payments that may be capped at annual minimum or maximum amounts. License fees represent a significant component of our cost of product revenues and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.\n \u00b7 the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with expansion of our current tests and the development of new tests; \nWe are a global healthcare company that provides clinically-actionable genomic information to personalize cancer treatment. We develop and globally commercialize genomic-based clinical laboratory services that analyze the underlying biology of cancer, allowing physicians and patients to make individualized treatment decisions. We are translating significant amounts of genomic data that will be useful for treatment planning throughout the cancer patient's journey, from diagnosis to treatment selection and monitoring. We offer our Oncotype DX tests as a clinical laboratory service, where we analyze the expression levels of genes in tumor tissue samples and provide physicians with a quantitative gene expression profile expressed as a single quantitative score, which we call a Recurrence Score for invasive breast cancer and colon cancer, a DCIS Score for ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, and a Genomic Prostate Score, or GPS, for prostate cancer\n \u00b7 costs related to filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; \nNet cash provided by in investing activities was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $14.2 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our investing activities have consisted predominantly of purchases and maturities of marketable securities and capital expenditures. Net cash provided by investing activities of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $29.7 million in net maturity of marketable securities and $23.5 million in capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures primarily reflects additional investments in a new enterprise resource planning system. Capital expenditures included $15.1 million of internal-use software development in the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities of $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $10.5 million of capital expenditures, a $2.0 million investment in privately held companies and $1.9 million in net purchase of marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities of $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $11.0 million in capital expenditures and $5.0 million investment in privately held companies, partially offset by $9.0 million in net maturities of marketable securities.\nThe $6.7 million, or 13%, increase in research and development expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a one-time $5.5 million expense for the wind-down of a license agreement and development program. Exclusive of this one-time expense, research and development expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 increased by $1.2 million primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in personnel-related expense, a $431,000 increase in reagents and laboratory supplies and an $85,000 increase stock-based compensation partially offset by an $890,000 decrease in collaboration expenses, a $754,000 decrease in other costs and a $316,000 decrease in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs.\nOther expense, net was $498,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to other expense, net of $764,000 and $158,000 for the years ended December 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was primarily related to $551,000, $790,000 and $158,000 of net foreign currency transaction losses, respectively, resulting from valuation adjustments to our international accounts receivable balance. We expect other income (expense), net to continue to fluctuate based on fluctuations in exchange rates that impact our foreign exchange transaction gains and losses.\nAs of the date of this report, we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our short-term marketable securities, and we expect that we will continue to be able to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities. We periodically monitor the financial position of our significant third-party payors, which include Medicare and managed care companies. As of the date of this report, we do not expect the current economic environment to have a material negative impact on our ability to collect payments from third-party payors in the foreseeable future. We believe the economic environment and changes in the healthcare system continued to impact product payment cycles, growth in tests delivered and product revenue generated during the year ended December 31, 2015. We intend to continue to assess the impact of the economic environment on our business activities. If the economic environment does not improve or deteriorates, our business including our patient population, government and third-party payors and our distributors and suppliers could be negatively affected, resulting in a negative impact on our product revenues.\nThe amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, such as the amount of cash provided by our operations, the progress of our commercialization efforts, product development, regulatory requirements, progress in reimbursement for our tests and available strategic opportunities for acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products.\nOperating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 costs associated with acquiring, licensing or investing in technologies, including NGS and our proprietary liquid platform; \n \u00b7 costs associated with expanding our commercial and laboratory operations, including our selling and marketing efforts; \nThe $11.1 million, or 17%, decrease in research and development expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 included a $7.7 million decrease in collaboration expense, a $7.5 million decrease in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs, a $682,000 decrease in reagents and laboratory supplies and a $343,000 decrease in stock-based compensation partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in other costs and a $2.2 million increase in personnel-related expenses. The $7.7 million decrease in collaboration and licensing expenses was primarily due to a $9.0 million up-front payment in 2013 under a licensing agreement.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe have continued to expand our business, both in the United States and internationally. We currently plan to continue to use substantially the same business model internationally as we use in the United States, however, there are significant differences between countries that need to be considered. For example, operational requirements generally vary from country to country, and different countries may have a public healthcare system, a combination of public and private healthcare system or a cash-based payment system. We have a direct commercial presence with employees in Canada, Japan and certain European counties, including our European headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Additionally, we have exclusive distribution agreements for the sale of our breast and colon cancer tests with distributors covering more than 90 countries outside of the United States.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of this report. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nCash Flows\nThe increase in personnel-related expenses for 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits due to increased headcount to support the launch of our prostate cancer test, as well as projects related to our product pipeline and ongoing work in NGS and our proprietary platform for liquid biopsy tests. The decrease in allocated information technology, facilities and other costs is primarily due to preparing for our prostate cancer product launch in 2013, which included project work from our various information technology groups, allocated based on specific development projects, as well as capitalization of certain costs of project work from our various information technology groups, allocated based on specific development projects in 2015.\nfor 2015 and 2014 compared to 2013 was due to a decrease in activities with collaboration partners. The contract revenues for 2013 included $1.5 million of contract revenue recognized in the fourth quarter upon completion of clinical validation work for Pfizer Inc. We expect that our contract revenues will continue to fluctuate based on the number and timing of studies being conducted.\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nInterest income was $221,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $192,000 and $222,000 for years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect our interest income will remain nominal if the current low interest rate environment continues.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we hire additional staff and incur other expenses to support the growth of our business, and to the extent we spend more on both billing and collections fees and bad debt expense.\n \u00b7 the rate of progress in establishing and maintaining reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international third-party payors; \nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.\n \u00b7 the effect of competing technological and market developments; \n\nCost of Product Revenues\nWe depend upon third-party payors, both public and private, to provide reimbursement for our tests. Accordingly, we have and expect to continue to focus substantial resources on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement coverage from third-party payors.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $8.4 million and $13.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our financing activities included sales of our equity securities and repurchases of our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 comprises $12.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchased pursuant to our ESPP, partially offset by cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $3.8 million related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and awards. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 comprises $12.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchased pursuant to our ESPP, partially offset by cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $3.6 million related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and awards. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $16.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchased pursuant to our ESPP, partially offset by cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $2.8 million related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and awards.\nHealthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures are being adopted in the U.S. and in many foreign countries. These reforms and measures, including those envisioned by the adoption in 2010 of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, could among other things limit the use of our tests and reduce reimbursement. We also expect that pricing of medical products and services will remain under pressure as alternative payment models such as bundling, value-based purchasing and accountable care organizations develop in the United States.\n \u00b7 costs related to future product launches; \nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) to provide guidance on revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Income\nContract revenues are generally derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recognized on a contract-specific basis. Under certain contracts, revenues are recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed. We may exercise judgment when estimating full-time equivalent level of effort, costs incurred and time to project completion. For certain contracts, we utilize the performance-based method of revenue recognition, which requires that we estimate the total amount of costs to be expended for a project and recognize revenue equal to the portion of costs expended to date. The estimated total costs to be expended are necessarily subject to revision from time-to-time as the underlying facts and circumstances change.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement ( ASU 2015-05\u201d). This amendment provides guidance to help entities determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software or as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, an entity has the option to apply the provisions of ASU 2015-05 either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified, or retrospectively. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-05 to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, education and promotional expenses, market analysis and development expenses and infrastructure expenses, including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs. These expenses include the costs of educating physicians, laboratory personnel and other healthcare professionals regarding our genomic technologies, how our Oncotype DX tests are developed and validated and the value of the quantitative information that our tests provide. Selling and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education, medical meeting participation and dissemination of scientific and economic publications related to our Oncotype DX tests. Our sales force compensation includes annual salaries and eligibility for quarterly commissions based on the achievement of predetermined sales goals and other management objectives.\n \u00b7 the rate of progress and cost of selling and marketing activities associated with expanding adoption of our Oncotype DX colon and prostate cancer and DCIS tests; \nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-2, Leases ( ASU 2016-2\u201d). ASU 2016-2 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. ASU 2016-2 is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019, and all annual and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-2 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n \u00b7 costs and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products or operations; \nU.S. Healthcare Environment\nIf we are not able to generate and maintain sustained product revenues to finance our cash requirements, we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders may result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our product or market development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nGeneral and Administrative
