Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThis annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements concerning PriceSmart, Inc.'s (\"PriceSmart\", the \"Company\" or \"we\") anticipated future revenues and earnings, adequacy of future cash flows, proposed warehouse club openings, the Company's performance relative to competitors and related matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements containing the words expect,\u201d believe,\u201d will,\u201d may,\u201d should,\u201d project,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipated,\u201d scheduled,\u201d and like expressions, and the negative thereof. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including, but not limited to the risks detailed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In addition, these risks are not the only risks that the Company faces. The Company could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating globally and in the U.S., as well as other risks that are not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial.\n\ufeff\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included therein.\nGeneral Market Factors\n\ufeff\nOur sales and profits vary from market to market depending on general economic factors, including GDP growth; consumer preferences; foreign currency exchange rates; political policies and social conditions; local demographic characteristics (such as population growth); the number of years we have operated in a particular market; and the level of retail and wholesale competition in that market.\n\ufeff\nCurrency fluctuations can be one of the largest variables affecting our overall sales and profit performance, as we have experienced in prior fiscal years, because many of our markets are susceptible to foreign currency exchange rate volatility. During fiscal year 2019, approximately 77.0% of our net merchandise sales were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Of those sales, 52.0% were comprised of sales of products we purchased in U.S. dollars.\n\ufeff\nA devaluation of local currency reduces the value of sales and membership income that is generated in that country when translated to U.S. dollars for our consolidated results. In addition, when local currency experiences devaluation, we may elect to increase the local currency price of imported merchandise to maintain our target margins, which could impact demand for the merchandise affected by the price increase. We may also modify the mix of imported versus local merchandise and/or the source of imported merchandise to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations. Information about the effect of local currency devaluations is discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Net Merchandise Sales and Comparable Sales.\u201d\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, one or more markets in which we operate may experience economic slowdowns, which can negatively impact our business. Most countries in our Central America segment experienced general market conditions that resulted in a difficult operating environment during fiscal year 2019. Increasing foreign currency exchange volatility, slowing global economy activity and trade, decreasing levels of public investment and tax reform stalled economic growth for most of our countries in this region. Our Colombia segment, in particular, experienced significant foreign currency exchange volatility during fiscal year 2019, which negatively affected reported sales growth for that segment.\n\ufeff\nOur capture of total retail and wholesale sales can vary from market to market due to competition and the availability of other shopping options for our members. In larger, more developed countries, such as Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Panama and Colombia, customers may have more alternatives available to them to satisfy their shopping needs, than in other smaller countries, such as Jamaica and Nicaragua, where consumers have a limited number of shopping options.\n\ufeff\nDemographic characteristics within each of our markets can also affect both the overall level of sales and also future sales growth opportunities. Island countries such as Aruba, Barbados and the U.S. Virgin Islands offer us limited upside for sales growth given their overall market size. Countries with a smaller upper and middle class consumer population, such as Honduras, El Salvador, Jamaica and Nicaragua, offer growth potential but they may have a more limited potential opportunity for sales growth as compared to more developed countries with larger upper and middle class consumer populations.\n\ufeff\nPolitical and other factors in each of our markets may have significant effects on our business. For example, labor strikes in Costa Rica disrupted normal commerce in September 2018. Social unrest in Honduras in May 2019 caused similar disruptions to commerce. U.S. foreign policy can also have an impact on social and economic stability in the countries where we operate. In 2018, U.S. legislation was approved to restrict U.S. aid to Nicaragua. Additionally, during 2019, the U.S. State Department has announced varying strategies regarding if, when and how it would authorize disbursement of foreign aid, that had been previously approved by the U.S. Congress, to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Changes in U.S. policies regarding financial assistance could cause political or financial instability in the countries we serve.\n\ufeff\nIn the past, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar illiquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to settle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products, increasing our foreign exchange exposure to any devaluation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar. We continued to experience this situation in Trinidad ( TT\u201d) during fiscal year 2019. We are working with our banks in Trinidad to source tradeable currencies (including Euros, British Pounds, and Canadian dollars), but until the central bank in Trinidad makes more U.S. dollars available, this illiquidity condition is likely to continue. As of August 31, 2019, our Trinidad subsidiary had a net Trinidad dollar denominated asset position measured in USD of approximately $24.9 million, a decrease of $15.4 million from August 31, 2018 when our Trinidad subsidiary had net Trinidad dollar denominated asset position of approximately $40.3 million. We are carefully monitoring the situation, which may require us to limit future shipments from the U.S. to Trinidad in line with our ability to exchange Trinidad dollars for tradeable currencies to manage our exposure to any potential devaluation.\nMission and Business Strategy\n\ufeff\nOur mission is to improve the quality of life for our business and family members. To do this, we make available a wide range of high quality merchandise sourced from around the world at exceptional values. The annual membership fee enables us to operate our business, offer a tailored selection of products, and services, with lower margins than traditional retail stores. Through the use of technology and the development of an omni-channel platform, we are pursuing opportunities to respond to how our members expect to shop, create additional efficiencies in the supply chain and increase our significance in our members' lives. We are working to create a shopping experience that blends the attributes and appeal of our brick and mortar business with the conveniences associated with technology-supported transactions and online shopping.\nGrowth\n\ufeff\nWe measure our growth primarily by the amount of the period-over-period activity in our net merchandise sales, our comparable store net merchandise sales and our membership income. Our investments are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. These investments can impact near-term results, such as when we incur fixed costs in advance of achieving full projected sales, negatively impacting near-term operating profit and net income, or when we open a new warehouse club in an existing market, which can reduce reported comparable net merchandise sales due to the transfer of sales from existing warehouse clubs.\nCurrent and Future Management Actions\n\ufeff\nLogistics and distribution efficiencies are fundamental to delivering high quality merchandise at low prices to our members. We continue to explore ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs and ensure a good flow of merchandise to our warehouse clubs. As we continue to refine our logistics and distribution infrastructure, we are exploring ways to improve our supply chain effectiveness through regional distribution centers that place our merchandise closer to our members.\n\ufeff\nPurchasing land and constructing warehouse clubs is generally our largest ongoing capital investment. Securing land for warehouse club locations is challenging within our markets, especially in Colombia, because suitable sites at economically feasible prices are difficult to find. We believe real estate ownership provides a number of advantages as compared to leasing, including lower operating expenses, flexibility to expand or otherwise enhance our buildings, long-term control over the use of the property and the residual value that the real estate may have in future years. While our preference is to own rather than lease real estate, we have entered into real estate leases in certain cases and will likely do so in the future.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, we began evaluating options to replace our existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. We have deferred that decision in order to more holistically assess our overall IT landscape and strategy. Nevertheless, we continue to enhance our IT systems and infrastructure to respond to evolving business requirements in a manner we believe to be consistent with a future ERP migration process.\nWe are investing in digital transformation, including omni-channel capabilities that enable e-commerce, by integrating technology, talent, supply chain and operations to enhance the membership shopping experience, drive efficiencies and fuel sales growth. Our focus will be on launching these omni-channel capabilities in a methodical phased manner.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFinancial highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 included:\n\ufeff\nTable 38: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal revenues increased 3.0% over the comparable prior year period.

Unless otherwise noted, all tables present U.S. dollar amounts in thousands. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Our operations consist of four reportable segments: Central America, the Caribbean, Colombia and the United States. The Company's reportable segments are based on management's organization of these locations into operating segments by general geographic location, which are used by management and the Company's chief operating decision maker in setting up management lines of responsibility, providing support services, and making operational decisions and assessments of financial performance. Segment amounts are presented after converting to U.S. dollars and consolidating eliminations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.\nNet Merchandise Sales\n\ufeff\nThe following tables indicate the net

In addition, we had 43 clubs in operation as of August 31, 2019 compared to 41 clubs as of August 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nNet merchandise sales in our Central America segment decreased 0.9% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. These declines had a 50 basis point (0.5%) negative impact on total net merchandise sales growth. Economic weakness, currency devaluation and political instability led to decreased sales within our Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and Nicaragua markets, offset by year-on-year increased merchandise sales within our El Salvador and Honduras markets.\n\ufeff\nNet merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment grew 6.2% for fiscal year 2019, when compared to fiscal year 2018. This increase had a 170 basis point (1.7%) positive impact on total net merchandise sales growth. Our Jamaica and Dominican Republic markets led the way in this segment by having 11.5% and 11.6% growth, respectively. In the Dominican Republic, we launched our fifth club in June 2019, while Jamaica had exceptional comparable net merchandise sales growth of 11.6%. With the exception of our Barbados market, all other markets within this segment showed increased net merchandise sales year-on-year.\n\ufeff\nNet merchandise sales in our Colombia segment experienced no material change for fiscal year 2019, when compared to fiscal year 2018. Net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment had no material impact on total net merchandise sales growth. The minimal growth for fiscal year 2019 is due to significant unfavorable foreign currency devaluation of the Colombian peso during the year.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 and 2017\n\ufeff\nOverall net merchandise sales grew by 4.9% for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, resulting from a 3.7% increase in transactions and a 1.2% increase in average ticket.\n\ufeff\nNet merchandise sales in our Central America segment increased 2.8% for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. General weakness in Panama, one of our largest markets in that segment, and social unrest starting in May 2018 within our Nicaragua market, resulted in negative combined growth within those two countries of 0.7% when compared to the prior year. All other Central American markets recorded positive growth in warehouse sales for the twelve-month period, with Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador together recording sales growth of greater than 3.5%.\n\ufeff\nOur Caribbean segment net merchandise sales increased 6.2% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, driven by sales increases within all of our markets in the segment, with the exception of our Barbados market. The difficult economic environment that affected fiscal year 2017 has improved, though we continue to closely monitor shipments of U.S. goods into our Trinidad market, as a result of continued currency illiquidity in that market. Trinidad net merchandise sales for fiscal year 2018 increased 2.2% when compared to the same period last year. The Company is not currently limiting shipments to Trinidad, but illiquidity concerns remain, which may again cause us to restrict shipments in the future.\n\ufeff\nOur Colombia segment's net merchandise sales increased 13.1% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. With the stabilization of the exchange rate between the Colombian peso and the U.S. dollar over the past two years, we have seen an improving sales picture in all of our warehouse clubs in Colombia. This, coupled with our efforts to source high quality merchandise from local suppliers, resulted in an 8.9% increase in transactions in the fiscal year and average ticket growth of 3.9%.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 and 2018 in Constant Currency\n\ufeff\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates\u201d refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activities translated using the current period's currency exchange rates, and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates.

The periods are established at the beginning of the fiscal year to provide as close a match as possible to the calendar month and quarter that is used for financial reporting purposes. This approach equalizes the number of weekend days and weekdays in each period for improved sales comparison, as we experience higher merchandise club sales on the weekends. Each of the warehouse clubs used in the calculations was open for at least 13 \u00bd calendar months before its results for the current period were compared with its results for the prior period. For example, sales related to our warehouse club in Panama opened on May 1, 2019 will not be used in the calculation of comparable sales until July 2020, and the sales related to our warehouse club opened in the Dominican Republic on June 27, 2019 will not be used in the calculation of comparable sales until September 2020.

This decrease contributed approximately 120 basis points (1.2%) of the decrease in total comparable merchandise sales.\n\ufeff\nFor the year, the negative economic conditions, foreign currency devaluation, and socio-political conditions within our Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and Nicaragua markets contributed approximately 100 basis points (1.0%) of the decrease, which was offset by a 30 basis point (0.3%) increase in Honduras and El Salvador. The Central America segment comparable merchandise sales for fiscal year 2019 were impacted by the opening of the Company's seventh warehouse club in Costa Rica in\nan area called Santa Ana. Often times, new warehouse clubs that we open are not far from existing warehouse clubs that are included in the calculation for comparable net merchandise sales, resulting in a transfer of some sales from an existing club (in this case Escazu) to the new club. This transfer of sales from existing warehouse clubs that are included in the calculation of comparable net merchandise sales to new warehouse clubs that are not included in the calculation can have an adverse impact on reported comparable net merchandise sales. We estimate that the transfer of sales associated with the Santa Ana opening negatively impacted the comparable net merchandise sales for the Central America segment by 50 basis points (0.5%). New warehouse clubs attract new members from areas not previously served by us and also create the opportunity for some existing members, particularly those who now find the new clubs closer to their homes, to shop more frequently.\n\ufeff\nComparable net merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment increased 2.2% for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. This increase contributed approximately 60 basis points (0.6%) of positive impact in total comparable merchandise sales.\n\ufeff\nThe opening of our fourth and fifth warehouse clubs in the Dominican Republic in May 2018 and June 2019 impacted this segment's comparable merchandise sales. We estimate that the transfer of sales associated with the opening of these warehouse clubs negatively impacted the Caribbean segment comparable merchandise sales by 160 basis points (1.6%) for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. All other markets in this segment, with the exception of Barbados, showed strong growth compared to the prior year. Notably, investments we made in our Jamaica market contributed to growth of 11.6% in comparable net merchandise sales during the year.\n\ufeff\nComparable net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment decreased 0.3% for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. The decrease had an immaterial negative impact in total comparable sales. The decline was largely due to the significantly unfavorable devaluation of the Colombia peso relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\nComparable net merchandise sales for those warehouse clubs that were open for at least 13 \u00bd months for some or all of the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018 grew 2.3%.\n\ufeff\nIn the Central America segment, we estimate that cannibalization from the opening of the Company's seventh warehouse club in Costa Rica negatively impacted the comparable net merchandise sales by 180 basis points (1.8%). New warehouse clubs attract new members from areas not previously served by us and also create the opportunity for some existing members, particularly those who now find the new clubs closer to their homes, to shop more frequently. Additionally, general weakness in Panama, one of our largest markets in this segment, and social unrest starting in May 2018 within our Nicaragua market impacted comparable net merchandise sales by approximately 70 basis points (0.7%).\n\ufeff\nThe Caribbean segment experienced positive comparable merchandise sales for fiscal year 2018, on improving conditions in all markets compared to the year earlier period, particularly Trinidad, Dominican Republic, Jamaica and USVI.\n\ufeff\nColombia recorded the highest comparable merchandise club sales of 13.4%.

In May 2018, we opened a new warehouse club in the Dominican Republic. This brought the number of PriceSmart warehouse clubs operating in Dominican Republic to four. The growth in membership accounts during fiscal year 2018 in our Colombia market was primarily attributable to an improving economy and the continued growth in the market's acceptance of the warehouse club concept.

The $20.0 million increase in non-merchandise revenue compared to the prior year represents the inclusion of twelve months of non-merchandise revenue during fiscal year 2019 versus the inclusion of only five-and-a-half months of non-merchandise revenue during fiscal year 2018. For the year ended August 31, 2019, the net increase of $7.4 million in Miscellaneous income was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase mainly resulting from the adoption of the new revenue standard ASC 606, which results in interest generating portfolio ( IGP\u201d) income being included in Miscellaneous income. The remaining $2.9 million is a reimbursement we received during the second and third quarter of this fiscal year for underpayment of income earned on our co-branded credit card IGP.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\nOther revenue for the year ended August 31, 2018, includes non-merchandise revenue generated by our marketplace and casillero operations primarily from freight and handlings charges for online orders placed from customers in Latin America to retailers in the United States and delivered to locations throughout Latin America from a business we acquired in March 2018.

Net merchandise margins decreased across all segments with the Central America segment contributing 10 basis points (0.1%), the Caribbean segment contributing 10 basis points (0.1%), and the Colombia segment contributed an immaterial amount to the overall decline. The 20 basis point (0.2%) decline compared to the prior year is a 30 basis point (0.3%) improvement from the nine-month period end May 31, 2019 when the year over year decline was 50 basis points (0.5%).\n\ufeff\nTotal gross margin to total revenues increased 30 basis points (0.3%) for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019. The year to date increase is due to six and a half months of additional revenue of our marketplace and casillero business compared to the prior year, which increased the gross margin to total revenues ratio by approximately 30 basis points (0.3%). Membership income, rental income and miscellaneous income gross margin percentage remained unchanged. The reclassification of income generated from the IGP as a result of the implementation of new revenue recognition standards along with a refund payment from a credit card vendor increased total gross margins by approximately 20 basis points (0.2%) for the year to date period. This 50 basis point (0.5%) increase was offset by a net merchandise sales gross margin decline of 20 basis points (0.2%).\n\ufeff\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses consist of warehouse club and other operations, general and administrative expenses, pre-opening expenses, and loss/(gain) on disposal of assets. In total, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $28.9 million to 12.8% of total revenues for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2019 compared to 12.1% for the same period during fiscal year 2018.\n\ufeff\nWarehouse club and other operations expense increased to 9.5% of total revenues compared to 9.2% for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2019. Our marketplace and casillero business added approximately $9.9 million or 30 basis points (0.3%) for the twelve-month period due to six and a half months of additional non-merchandise operations expense of our marketplace and casillero business compared to the prior year.\n\ufeff\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to 3.1% compared to 2.8% for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2019. Our investments to expand our omni-channel capabilities, together with our marketplace and casillero business added approximately $9.8 million or 30 basis points (0.3%), in costs to this line item for the twelve-month period. Additionally, in the first fiscal quarter was a $3.8 million, separation and other related termination benefits charge for our former Chief Executive Officer and President who resigned in October 2018 by mutual agreement with the Board of Directors.\n\ufeff\nPre-opening expense increased $1.8 million or 0.1% of total revenues compared to the prior year period. This increase is attributable to costs incurred to open our 42nd and 43rd warehouse club and for the two remaining warehouse clubs expected to open this calendar year.\n\ufeff\nOperating income for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019, decreased to $115.2 million (3.6% of total revenue) compared to $126.1 million (4.0% of total revenue) for the same period last year. As described above, lower merchandise margins as a percent of sales, higher expenses year-on-year related to investments to expand our omni-channel capabilities and the inclusion for the full twelve months ended August 31, 2019 of the net operating results from our marketplace and casillero business acquired in March 2018 were the primary factors for the decrease in operating income.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\nTotal revenue increased 5.7% from the twelve months ended August 31, 2017 to the same period ended August 31, 2018, year on year increases to net merchandise sales contributed 480 basis points (4.8%), non-merchandise revenue from Aeropost contributed 60 basis points (0.6%), increased export sales contributed 20 basis points (0.2%) and increased membership income contributed ten basis points (0.1%).\n\ufeff\nGross margin on merchandise sales as a percentage of total revenue remained unchanged at 14.5% for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018 compared to the twelve month period ended August 31, 2017. Total gross margin to total revenues increased to 16.1% from 15.9% for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, mainly due to higher margins on nonmerchandise revenues of our Aeropost subsidiary, which increased the gross margin on total revenues, by approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) for the year. Membership income, rental income and miscellaneous income gross margin remained unchanged\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of warehouse club and other operations, general and administrative expenses, pre-opening expenses, asset impairment and loss/(gain) on disposal of assets. In total, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $43.5 million to 12.1% of total revenues, an increase of 70 basis points (0.7%) compared to 11.4% of total revenues in fiscal year 2017. Warehouse club and other operations contributed 20 basis points (0.2%) of this increase. This was mainly due to approximately $6.4 million (0.2% of total revenues) in additional other operational costs associated with our Aeropost subsidiary during fiscal year 2018. General and administrative expenses contributed the remaining 50 basis points (0.5%) of the year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue, with $9.7 million in general and administrative costs associated with Aeropost contributing 30 basis points (0.3%) of this increase. The $9.7 million was composed of $1.1 million in amortization of technology intangibles, $1.4 million in amortization of post-combination compensation costs, and $7.2 million of other general and administrative costs. We also recorded in general and administrative expense during fiscal year 2018 $669,000 in acquisition costs, including legal, accounting and technical consulting related to the acquisition of Aeropost. Additionally, general and administrative expenses also grew as a percentage to total revenues due to increased staffing in our buying department and increased information technology costs. Asset impairment charges for approximately $1.4 million, net of tax benefit, were related to the write-off of costs for a software platform\nthat was under development prior to the acquisition of Aeropost, because of Aeropost's Information Technology ( IT\u201d) platform and IT development capability.\n\ufeff\nOperating income for fiscal year 2018 was $126.1 million (4.0% of total revenue) compared to $136.2 million (4.5% of total revenue) for the same period last year. Within our Central America segment, higher expenses related to the addition of a new warehouse club coupled with lower sales volumes within our Panama and Nicaragua markets accounted for forty basis points (0.4%) of the decrease in operating income to total revenues. Additionally, the increase of approximately $16.1 million in total selling, general and administrative costs due to the additional costs of our Aeropost subsidiary, which are recorded within our U.S. segment, were the primary drivers of our decreased operating income by an additional thirty basis points (0.3%). These decreases were partially offset by an increase of operating income within our Colombia segment of 0.2% of total revenue, primarily due to increases in sales from the continued improved economic conditions in Colombia.\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

2018\n\ufeff\nNet interest expense decreased $1.1 million for the year ended August 31, 2019. Interest expense related to loans increased for the year ended August 31, 2019 due to increased use of more expensive short-term borrowing facilities. However, interest expense related to hedging activity decreased during the year ended August 31, 2019 due to the pay off of the various loans held by our subsidiaries that were hedged, and we capitalized more interest for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 because of higher levels of construction activities for the two clubs opened during the fiscal year and the two additional clubs to opened in the fall of calendar year 2019.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\nNet interest expense for the year ended August 31, 2018 decreased $1.7 million when compared to prior year. Loans decreased year-on-year primarily due to the pay-off of loans within our subsidiaries. Lower average loan balance on both long-term and short-term loans were partially offset by higher variable ( LIBOR\u201d) interest rates. Interest expense related to hedging activity decreased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 due to the pay-off of the various loans held by our subsidiaries that were hedged and the remaining hedged loans having positive ( in the money\u201d) positions. Additional capitalized interest in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 resulted from higher levels of construction activities.\n\ufeff\nOther Income (Expense), net\n\ufeff\nOther income consists of currency gain or loss, as well as net benefit costs related to our defined benefit plans.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31,\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\nfrom\nprior year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1,607) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1,799) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>192 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31,\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\nfrom\nprior year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>192 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1,290) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,482 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity (primarily U.S. dollars) are revalued to the functional currency using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.

The main drivers for the year-to-date period loss is attributable to significant increases in our average U.S. dollar asset position in Jamaica and our average U.S. dollar liability position in the Dominican Republic compared to a year ago. We increased these positions to provide capital resources for our current and future warehouse club construction activities and other investments. In Jamaica our average U.S. dollar asset position was $19.8 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to $16.6 million in fiscal year 2018, or a 19% increase year-over-year. In the Dominican Republic our average U.S. dollar liability position was $26.6 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to $8.0 million in fiscal year 2018, or a 235% increase year-over-year.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\nFor fiscal year 2018, we recorded net income associated with foreign currency transactions. During fiscal year 2018, we were able to mitigate losses associated with foreign currency transactions that were driven by the weakening of currencies within all of our major markets and high transaction costs associated with converting Trinidad dollars into available tradeable currencies such as Euros or Canadian dollars before converting them to U.S. dollars. We mitigated the higher transaction costs in Trinidad by adding additional costs into our pricing models in order to offset the higher transaction costs in Trinidad. As a result, we reported approximately $192,000 in net gains from foreign currency exchange for fiscal year 2018. For as long as the currency sourcing situation continues in Trinidad, we plan to maintain additional cost in our pricing model and will limit our shipments from the U.S. to Trinidad to levels that generally align with our Trinidad subsidiary's ability to pay for the merchandise in U.S. dollars.\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nU.S. Tax Reform in December 2017 lowered the federal

When the functional currency in our international subsidiaries is the local currency and not U.S. dollars, the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period.

These adjustments will not affect net income until the sale or liquidation of the underlying investment.

Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net merchandise sales and membership fees. Cash flows used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs (including payroll, employee benefits and utilities), as well as payments for income taxes. The $50.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase of accounts payable of $25.3 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to a decrease in accounts payable of $16.5 million in fiscal year 2018, which resulted in a $41.8 million change year-over-year. In addition, the net increase in other current and non-current assets and liabilities resulted in a $16.1 million change year-over-year. The accounts payable increase resulted from several factors, including a shift in the timing of inventory purchases in anticipation of the holiday season versus a year ago and working capital efficiency improvements. The other current and non-current assets and liabilities decrease is primarily the result of increases in salary and benefit accruals, deferred income, and other accruals due to the opening of two new clubs, which added additional headcount and membership income.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $124.7 million and $153.8 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash used in investing activities is primarily for the construction of and improvements to our warehouse clubs. The $29.1 million decrease in investing activities is the result of a net $47.6 million decrease in certificate of deposits purchases and settlements compared to a year-ago and a $23.9 million decrease in acquisition activity versus a year-ago as we made no acquisitions in fiscal year 2019 offset by $42.0 million of additional construction expenditures and land purchases made for our expected future warehouse club openings.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in financing activities total $32.0 million and $27.8 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash flows provided or used for financing activities are used primarily to fund our working capital needs and our warehouse club expansions and investments. The $4.2 million increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily the result of a net decrease of proceeds from long-term borrowings of $9.4 million compared to a year ago as we did not have any additional long-term borrowings in fiscal year 2019. Additionally, the amount of cash we used to repurchase shares of restricted stock upon vesting to cover employees' tax withholding obligations increased $1.4 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily as a result of the acceleration of vesting as a component of severance for one of our officers. We received $7.5 million of proceeds from short-term borrowings to fund our working capital and capital investment needs, offsetting this $10.8 million of cash used.\n\ufeff\nShort-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt\n\ufeff\nOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets while minimizing our borrowing costs. The proceeds of these borrowings were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.

Some of our accounting policies require management to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to business acquisitions, contingencies and litigation, income taxes, value added taxes, and long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Using different estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. As of August 31, 2019, we evaluated our deferred tax assets and liabilities and determined that a valuation allowance was necessary for certain deferred tax asset balances, primarily because of the existence of significant negative objective evidence, such as the fact that certain subsidiaries are in a cumulative loss position for the past three years, indicating that certain net operating loss carry-forward periods are not sufficient to realize the related deferred tax assets. We also specifically considered whether foreign tax credit balances could be utilized in the foreseeable future in light of current and future U.S. tax liabilities. We have historically applied foreign tax credits, generated from taxes withheld on certain payments PriceSmart receives from our foreign subsidiaries, to reduce U.S. income tax liabilities. However, as an incidental result of U.S. tax reform, following the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, we expect foreign tax credits generated to exceed U.S. income tax liability for the foreseeable future. Therefore, as of August 31, 2019, we have recorded valuation allowance of $6.7 million against our foreign tax credits.\n\ufeff\nWe are required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. The preparation of these tax returns requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by us. We, in consultation with our tax advisors, base our tax returns on interpretations that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The tax returns, however, are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we file our tax returns. As part of these reviews, a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the interpretations we used to calculate our tax liability and therefore require us to pay additional taxes.\n\ufeff\nWe accrue an amount for our estimate of probable additional income tax liability. In certain cases, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has 50% or less likelihood of being sustained. This requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. There were no material changes in our uncertain income tax positions for the periods ended on August 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\ufeff\nTax Receivables\n\ufeff\nWe pay Value Added Tax ( VAT\u201d) or similar taxes ( input VAT\u201d), income taxes, and other taxes within the normal course of our business in most of the countries in which we operate related to the procurement of merchandise and/or services we acquire and/or on sales and taxable income. We also collect VAT or similar taxes on behalf of the government ( output VAT\u201d) for merchandise and/or services we sell. If the output VAT exceeds the input VAT, then the difference is remitted to the government, usually on a monthly basis. If the input VAT exceeds the output VAT, this creates a VAT receivable. In most countries where we operate, the governments have implemented additional collection procedures, such as requiring credit card processors to remit a portion of sales processed via credit card directly to the government as advance payments of VAT and/or income tax. In the case of VAT, these procedures alter the natural offset of input and output VAT and generally leave us with a net VAT receivable, forcing us to process significant refund claims on a recurring basis. With respect to income taxes paid, if the estimated income taxes paid or withheld exceed the actual income tax due this creates an income tax receivable. We either request a refund of these tax receivables or apply the balance to expected future tax payments. These refund or offset processes can take anywhere from several months to several years to complete.\n\ufeff\nIn most countries where we operate, the VAT refund process is defined and structured with regular refunds or offsets. However, we, together with our tax and legal advisers, are currently seeking clarification in court and pursuing other alternatives in one country without a clearly defined process and expect to prevail. The balance of the VAT receivable in the country with undefined refund mechanisms was approximately $5.1 million and $3.1 million as of August 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively. In another country in which we have warehouse clubs, beginning in fiscal year 2015, a new minimum income tax mechanism took effect, which requires us to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales rather than income. As a result, we are making income tax payments substantially in excess of those we would expect to pay based on taxable income. The rules (which we have challenged in court), effective for fiscal years 2015 to 2018, do not clearly allow us to obtain a refund or offset this excess income tax against other taxes. As of August 31, 2019, we had deferred tax assets of approximately $2.6 million in this country. Also, we had an income tax receivable balance of $7.8 million as of August 31, 2019 related to excess payments from fiscal year 2015 to 2019. In fiscal year 2018, a revised minimum tax law was passed in this country, which beginning in fiscal year 2020 will reduce the minimum tax rate. Additionally, this law clarifies on a go-forward basis the reimbursement process for excess minimum tax paid beginning in fiscal year 2019, but does not address periods prior to fiscal year 2019. Nevertheless, we have not placed any type of allowance on the recoverability of these tax receivables or deferred tax assets, because we believe that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately succeed in our refund requests, related appeals and/or court challenge on this matter.\nOur policy for classification and presentation of VAT receivables, income tax receivables and other tax receivables is as follows:\n\ufeff\nTable 110: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nShort-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other current assets: This classification is used for any countries where our subsidiary has generally demonstrated the ability to recover the VAT or income tax receivable within one year. We also classify as short-term any approved refunds or credit notes to the extent that we expect to receive the refund or use the credit notes within one year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nTable 111: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLong-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other non-current assets: This classification is used for amounts not approved for refund or credit in countries where our subsidiary has not demonstrated the ability to obtain refunds within one year and/or for amounts which are subject to outstanding disputes. An allowance is provided against VAT and income tax receivable balances in dispute when we do not expect to eventually prevail in our recovery of such balances. We do not currently have any allowances provided against VAT and income tax receivables.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nLong-lived Assets\n\ufeff\nWe periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. Indicators that an asset may be impaired are:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe asset's inability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloss of legal ownership or title to the asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsignificant changes in its strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe impact of significant negative industry or economic trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nManagement's judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation and can include management's best estimate of future business activity, which in turn drives estimates of future cash flows from these assets. These periodic evaluations could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value. Future business conditions and/or activity could differ materially from the projections made by management causing the need for additional impairment charges. No impairment charges have been recorded during fiscal year 2019 related to the loss of legal ownership or title to assets; significant changes in the Company's strategic business objectives or utilization of assets; or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. Loss/(gain) on disposal of assets recorded during the years reported resulted from improvements to operations and normal preventive maintenance.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $46.1 million of certain acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge.\n\ufeff\nSeasonality\n\ufeff\nHistorically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political events in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix, and currency effects on the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and therefore more or less affordable. Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition, there can be no assurance that our future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.\n\ufeff", "item_7_truncated": " \u00b7 Merchandise gross profits (net merchandise sales less associated cost of goods sold) in the quarter increased 7.1% over the prior-year period, and merchandise gross profits as a percent of net merchandise sales were 15.2%, an increase of 50 basis points (0.5%) from the same period in the prior year. \nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nIncrease from\nprior year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-merchandise revenue\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>36,837 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>19,974 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>118.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>16,863 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMiscellaneous income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9,049 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,375 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>440.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,674 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRental income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,254 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>245 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,009 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther revenue\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>49,140 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>27,594 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>128.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>21,546 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn most countries where we operate, the VAT refund process is defined and structured with regular refunds or offsets.

These investments can impact near-term results, such as when we incur fixed costs in advance of achieving full projected sales, negatively impacting near-term operating profit and net income, or when we open a new warehouse club in an existing market, which can reduce reported comparable net merchandise sales due to the transfer of sales from existing warehouse clubs.\n\ufeff\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nCurrency Exchange Rate Fluctuations for the\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTwelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% change to prior year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCentral America\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(48,622) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCaribbean\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(11,039) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1.3) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nColombia\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(37,651) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(9.8) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet merchandise sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(97,312) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3.2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nIncrease/\n(decrease)\nfrom\nprior year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCurrent tax expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>41,216 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(3,649) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>44,865 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet deferred tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,961 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9,808 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,847) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>48,177 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>6,159 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>42,018 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>39.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>31.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 5.

We also collect VAT or similar taxes on behalf of the government ( output VAT\u201d) for merchandise and/or services we sell. If the output VAT exceeds the input VAT, then the difference is remitted to the government, usually on a monthly basis. If the input VAT exceeds the output VAT, this creates a VAT receivable. In most countries where we operate, the governments have implemented additional collection procedures, such as requiring credit card processors to remit a portion of sales processed via credit card directly to the government as advance payments of VAT and/or income tax. In the case of VAT, these procedures alter the natural offset of input and output VAT and generally leave us with a net VAT receivable, forcing us to process significant refund claims on a recurring basis. With respect to income taxes paid, if the estimated income taxes paid or withheld exceed the actual income tax due this creates an income tax receivable. We either request a refund of these tax receivables or apply the balance to expected future tax payments. These refund or offset processes can take anywhere from several months to several years to complete.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31,\n</td> <td>\nAugust 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\nfrom\nprior year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>192 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1,290) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,482 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n 6.

We ended the quarter with 43 warehouse clubs compared to 41 warehouse clubs at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by 2.6%. \nComparison of 2019 to 2018\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nHistorically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political events in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix, and currency effects on the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and therefore more or less affordable. Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition, there can be no assurance that our future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe following tables indicate the net merchandise club sales in the reportable segments in which we operate, and the percentage growth in net merchandise sales by segment during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\n\ufeff\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included therein.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\nComparison of 2019 to 2018 in Constant Currency\n \u00b7 Net income attributable to PriceSmart for fiscal year 2019 was $73.2 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, compared to $74.3 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, in the prior year. \nResults of Operations\nAdditionally, we continued expanding our Platinum membership program. We began offering Platinum memberships in Honduras, Jamaica, Aruba, USVI and Barbados in fiscal year 2019.\nThe opening of our fourth and fifth warehouse clubs in the Dominican Republic in May 2018 and June 2019 impacted this segment's comparable merchandise sales. We estimate that the transfer of sales associated with the opening of these warehouse clubs negatively impacted the Caribbean segment comparable merchandise sales by 160 basis points (1.6%) for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. All other markets in this segment, with the exception of Barbados, showed strong growth compared to the prior year. Notably, investments we made in our Jamaica market contributed to growth of 11.6% in comparable net merchandise sales during the year.\nComparable net merchandise sales included 39 warehouse clubs for the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018. The following table illustrates the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our comparable merchandise sales in dollars and the percentage change from the fifty-two week periods ended September 2, 2018.\nNet interest expense for the year ended August 31, 2018 decreased $1.7 million when compared to prior year. Loans decreased year-on-year primarily due to the pay-off of loans within our subsidiaries. Lower average loan balance on both long-term and short-term loans were partially offset by higher variable ( LIBOR\u201d) interest rates. Interest expense related to hedging activity decreased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 due to the pay-off of the various loans held by our subsidiaries that were hedged and the remaining hedged loans having positive ( in the money\u201d) positions. Additional capitalized interest in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 resulted from higher levels of construction activities.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n \u00b7 Comparable net merchandise sales (that is, sales in the warehouse clubs that have been open for greater than 13 \u00bd calendar months) for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2019 decreased 0.6%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted comparable net merchandise sales negatively by 3.2%. \nThe growth in membership accounts during fiscal year 2019 in our Caribbean market was primarily attributable to the opening of the new Bolivar warehouse club in the Dominican Republic in June 2019. Membership accounts in Colombia increased during the same period primarily due to an improving economy and the continued growth in the market's acceptance of the warehouse club concept. Membership accounts in Central America increased during the same period primarily due to the opening of the new Veraguas warehouse club in Panama in May 2019. The Company's twelve-month renewal rate increased to 85.7% for the year ended August 31, 2019 from 85.1% for the year ended August 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\n (2) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by approximately $2.3 million to reflect the amounts net of expected sublease income. Operating lease obligations include $1.6 million of lease payment obligations for the prior leased Miami distribution center. For the purposes of calculating the minimum lease payments, a reduction is reflected for the actual sublease income the Company expects to receive during the remaining lease term. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nColombia recorded the highest comparable merchandise club sales of 13.4%. The comparable warehouse sales growth benefitted from continued stability in the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar.\n \u00b7 Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 was $32.0 million, an increase of $4.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. \n\ufeff\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity (primarily U.S. dollars) are revalued to the functional currency using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. These foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) are recorded as currency gains or losses. Additionally, gains or losses from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity also generate currency gains or losses.\nNet merchandise sales in our Central America segment decreased 0.9% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. These declines had a 50 basis point (0.5%) negative impact on total net merchandise sales growth. Economic weakness, currency devaluation and political instability led to decreased sales within our Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and Nicaragua markets, offset by year-on-year increased merchandise sales within our El Salvador and Honduras markets.\n \u00b7 Total revenues increased 5.7% over the comparable prior year period. 0.6% of this increase was the result of approximately $16.9 million in non-merchandise revenue from our Aeropost operations acquired in March 2018. \nWarehouse club and other operations expense increased to 9.5% of total revenues compared to 9.2% for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2019. Our marketplace and casillero business added approximately $9.9 million or 30 basis points (0.3%) for the twelve-month period due to six and a half months of additional non-merchandise operations expense of our marketplace and casillero business compared to the prior year.\nGrowth\n\ufeff\nWe periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. Indicators that an asset may be impaired are:\n 3. The comparably favorable impact of 1.6% resulting from improved financial results in the Company's Colombia subsidiary for which no tax attribute was recognized, net of adjustment to valuation allowance. \n\ufeff\nThe tables below summarize the effective tax rate for the periods reported:\nCurrency devaluations had a $48.6 million or 270 basis point (2.7%) negative constant currency impact on net merchandise sales in our Central America segment for the year ended August 31, 2019. The currency devaluations contributed approximately 160 basis points (1.6%) of the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales. Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and our Nicaragua markets all experienced currency devaluation when compared to the same period last year.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to 3.1% compared to 2.8% for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2019. Our investments to expand our omni-channel capabilities, together with our marketplace and casillero business added approximately $9.8 million or 30 basis points (0.3%), in costs to this line item for the twelve-month period. Additionally, in the first fiscal quarter was a $3.8 million, separation and other related termination benefits charge for our former Chief Executive Officer and President who resigned in October 2018 by mutual agreement with the Board of Directors.\nThe following table indicates the impact that currency exchange rates had on our net merchandise sales in dollars and the percentage change from the year ended August 31, 2019.\nOur capture of total retail and wholesale sales can vary from market to market due to competition and the availability of other shopping options for our members. In larger, more developed countries, such as Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Panama and Colombia, customers may have more alternatives available to them to satisfy their shopping needs, than in other smaller countries, such as Jamaica and Nicaragua, where consumers have a limited number of shopping options.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n (3) The amounts shown represent contractual obligations for construction services not yet rendered. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Long-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other non-current assets: This classification is used for amounts not approved for refund or credit in countries where our subsidiary has not demonstrated the ability to obtain refunds within one year and/or for amounts which are subject to outstanding disputes. An allowance is provided against VAT and income tax receivable balances in dispute when we do not expect to eventually prevail in our recovery of such balances. We do not currently have any allowances provided against VAT and income tax receivables. \nOther income consists of currency gain or loss, as well as net benefit costs related to our defined benefit plans.\n\ufeff\nThe growth in membership accounts during fiscal year 2018 within our Central America and Caribbean segments is primarily the result of the addition of a new warehouse club within each segment. We opened a new warehouse club in Santa Ana, Costa Rica in October 2017 (fiscal year 2018), bringing the total of warehouse clubs operating in Costa Rica to seven. In May 2018, we opened a new warehouse club in the Dominican Republic. This brought the number of PriceSmart warehouse clubs operating in Dominican Republic to four. The growth in membership accounts during fiscal year 2018 in our Colombia market was primarily attributable to an improving economy and the continued growth in the market's acceptance of the warehouse club concept. The Company's twelve-month renewal rate for the periods ended August 31, 2018 and 2017 remained steady at 85%.\nCurrency devaluations had a $14.1 million or 80 basis point (0.8%) negative constant currency impact on net merchandise sales in our Central America segment for the year ended August 31, 2018. The currency devaluations contributed approximately 50 basis points (0.5%) of the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales.\n\nOverall, the effects of currency devaluations within our markets had an approximate $96.0 million, or 320 basis point (3.2%), negative constant currency impact on comparable net merchandise for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019.\n\nPurchasing land and constructing warehouse clubs is generally our largest ongoing capital investment. Securing land for warehouse club locations is challenging within our markets, especially in Colombia, because suitable sites at economically feasible prices are difficult to find. We believe real estate ownership provides a number of advantages as compared to leasing, including lower operating expenses, flexibility to expand or otherwise enhance our buildings, long-term control over the use of the property and the residual value that the real estate may have in future years. While our preference is to own rather than lease real estate, we have entered into real estate leases in certain cases and will likely do so in the future.\n\n 2. The comparably unfavorable net impact of 3.5%, resulting from the favorable impact of 2.6% resulting from new export-related sales and service tax incentives; and the unfavorable impact of 6.1% from valuation allowances on deferred tax assets from foreign tax credits that, incidental to U.S. Tax Reform, are no longer deemed recoverable. \nComparison of 2019 and 2018 in Constant Currency\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Our effective tax rate increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 to 34.1% from 27.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the unfavorable impact from valuation allowances on deferred tax assets from foreign tax credits that, incidental to U.S. Tax Reform, are no longer deemed recoverable, offset by U.S. Tax Reform rate reduction and tax incentives. \nFinancial Position and Cash Flow\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nOverall, the effects of currency devaluations within our markets had an approximate $12.9 million, or 40 basis point (0.4%), negative constant currency impact on comparable net merchandise for the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations Consolidated\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe Caribbean segment experienced positive comparable merchandise sales for fiscal year 2018, on improving conditions in all markets compared to the year earlier period, particularly Trinidad, Dominican Republic, Jamaica and USVI.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Comparable net merchandise sales (that is, sales in the warehouse clubs that have been open for greater than 13 \u00bd calendar months) for the 52 weeks ended September 2, 2018 increased 2.3%. \nPlease refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6 - Stockholders' Equity for further discussion.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; \n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $124.7 million and $153.8 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash used in investing activities is primarily for the construction of and improvements to our warehouse clubs. The $29.1 million decrease in investing activities is the result of a net $47.6 million decrease in certificate of deposits purchases and settlements compared to a year-ago and a $23.9 million decrease in acquisition activity versus a year-ago as we made no acquisitions in fiscal year 2019 offset by $42.0 million of additional construction expenditures and land purchases made for our expected future warehouse club openings.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\nThe number of member accounts during fiscal year 2019 was 2.5% higher than the year before. Membership income increased 2.6% over the same period.\n\nComparable net merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment increased 2.2% for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. This increase contributed approximately 60 basis points (0.6%) of positive impact in total comparable merchandise sales.\n\ufeff\n (1) Long-term debt includes debt with both fixed and variable interest rates. We have used rates as of August 31, 2019 to calculate future estimated payments related to the variable rate items. For the portion of the loans subject to interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, we have used the fixed interest rate as set by the interest rate swaps. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOther revenue for the year ended August 31, 2018, includes non-merchandise revenue generated by our marketplace and casillero operations primarily from freight and handlings charges for online orders placed from customers in Latin America to retailers in the United States and delivered to locations throughout Latin America from a business we acquired in March 2018. Rental income and miscellaneous income had no material changes when compared to the prior year.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nLogistics and distribution efficiencies are fundamental to delivering high quality merchandise at low prices to our members. We continue to explore ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs and ensure a good flow of merchandise to our warehouse clubs. As we continue to refine our logistics and distribution infrastructure, we are exploring ways to improve our supply chain effectiveness through regional distribution centers that place our merchandise closer to our members.\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\nThe table below summarizes the effect that U.S. Tax Reform had on net income and earnings per share attributable to PriceSmart available for distribution:\nOur mission is to improve the quality of life for our business and family members. To do this, we make available a wide range of high quality merchandise sourced from around the world at exceptional values. The annual membership fee enables us to operate our business, offer a tailored selection of products, and services, with lower margins than traditional retail stores. Through the use of technology and the development of an omni-channel platform, we are pursuing opportunities to respond to how our members expect to shop, create additional efficiencies in the supply chain and increase our significance in our members' lives. We are working to create a shopping experience that blends the attributes and appeal of our brick and mortar business with the conveniences associated with technology-supported transactions and online shopping.\n\ufeff\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. As of August 31, 2019, we evaluated our deferred tax assets and liabilities and determined that a valuation allowance was necessary for certain deferred tax asset balances, primarily because of the existence of significant negative objective evidence, such as the fact that certain subsidiaries are in a cumulative loss position for the past three years, indicating that certain net operating loss carry-forward periods are not sufficient to realize the related deferred tax assets. We also specifically considered whether foreign tax credit balances could be utilized in the foreseeable future in light of current and future U.S. tax liabilities. We have historically applied foreign tax credits, generated from taxes withheld on certain payments PriceSmart receives from our foreign subsidiaries, to reduce U.S. income tax liabilities. However, as an incidental result of U.S. tax reform, following the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, we expect foreign tax credits generated to exceed U.S. income tax liability for the foreseeable future. Therefore, as of August 31, 2019, we have recorded valuation allowance of $6.7 million against our foreign tax credits.\n\ufeff\nNet interest expense decreased $1.1 million for the year ended August 31, 2019. Interest expense related to loans increased for the year ended August 31, 2019 due to increased use of more expensive short-term borrowing facilities. However, interest expense related to hedging activity decreased during the year ended August 31, 2019 due to the pay off of the various loans held by our subsidiaries that were hedged, and we capitalized more interest for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 because of higher levels of construction activities for the two clubs opened during the fiscal year and the two additional clubs to opened in the fall of calendar year 2019.\n\ufeff\nFinancial highlights for fiscal year 2019 included:\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n 1. The comparably favorable impact of 10.2% resulting from nonrecurrence of the U.S. Tax Reform Transition Tax. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Net income attributable to PriceSmart for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 was $20.7 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to $19.0 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. \nThe following table summarizes the shares repurchased during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nPolitical and other factors in each of our markets may have significant effects on our business. For example, labor strikes in Costa Rica disrupted normal commerce in September 2018. Social unrest in Honduras in May 2019 caused similar disruptions to commerce. U.S. foreign policy can also have an impact on social and economic stability in the countries where we operate. In 2018, U.S. legislation was approved to restrict U.S. aid to Nicaragua. Additionally, during 2019, the U.S. State Department has announced varying strategies regarding if, when and how it would authorize disbursement of foreign aid, that had been previously approved by the U.S. Congress, to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Changes in U.S. policies regarding financial assistance could cause political or financial instability in the countries we serve.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOther revenue for the year ended August 31, 2019 includes non-merchandise revenue generated by our marketplace and casillero operations primarily from freight and handlings charges for online orders placed from customers in Latin America to retailers in the United States and delivered to locations throughout Latin America from a business we acquired in March 2018. The $20.0 million increase in non-merchandise revenue compared to the prior year represents the inclusion of twelve months of non-merchandise revenue during fiscal year 2019 versus the inclusion of only five-and-a-half months of non-merchandise revenue during fiscal year 2018. For the year ended August 31, 2019, the net increase of $7.4 million in Miscellaneous income was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase mainly resulting from the adoption of the new revenue standard ASC 606, which results in interest generating portfolio ( IGP\u201d) income being included in Miscellaneous income. The remaining $2.9 million is a reimbursement we received during the second and third quarter of this fiscal year for underpayment of income earned on our co-branded credit card IGP.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 39.3%, as compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 of 31.7%. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\nNet merchandise sales in our Colombia segment experienced no material change for fiscal year 2019, when compared to fiscal year 2018. Net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment had no material impact on total net merchandise sales growth. The minimal growth for fiscal year 2019 is due to significant unfavorable foreign currency devaluation of the Colombian peso during the year.\nCurrency devaluations had an $11.0 million or 130 basis point (1.3%) negative constant currency impact on reported net merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment for the year ended August 31, 2019. The currency devaluations contributed approximately 40 basis points (0.4%) of the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales. This is reflective of the offsetting devaluation and appreciation of the mix of currencies within the markets in this segment when compared to the same period a year ago.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $46.1 million of certain acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses consist of warehouse club and other operations, general and administrative expenses, pre-opening expenses, and loss/(gain) on disposal of assets. In total, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $28.9 million to 12.8% of total revenues for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2019 compared to 12.1% for the same period during fiscal year 2018.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFor fiscal year 2018, we recorded net income associated with foreign currency transactions. During fiscal year 2018, we were able to mitigate losses associated with foreign currency transactions that were driven by the weakening of currencies within all of our major markets and high transaction costs associated with converting Trinidad dollars into available tradeable currencies such as Euros or Canadian dollars before converting them to U.S. dollars. We mitigated the higher transaction costs in Trinidad by adding additional costs into our pricing models in order to offset the higher transaction costs in Trinidad. As a result, we reported approximately $192,000 in net gains from foreign currency exchange for fiscal year 2018. For as long as the currency sourcing situation continues in Trinidad, we plan to maintain additional cost in our pricing model and will limit our shipments from the U.S. to Trinidad to levels that generally align with our Trinidad subsidiary's ability to pay for the merchandise in U.S. dollars.\nRepatriation of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries may require us to accrue and pay taxes. We have no plans at this time to repatriate cash through the payment of cash dividends by our foreign subsidiaries to our domestic operations and, therefore, have not accrued taxes that would be due from repatriation.\n\ufeff\nThe following table illustrates the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our comparable merchandise sales in dollars and the percentage change from the fifty-two week periods ended September 1, 2019.\nThe following table summarizes the selling, general and administrative expense for the periods disclosed.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIn the past, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar illiquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to settle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products, increasing our foreign exchange exposure to any devaluation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar. We continued to experience this situation in Trinidad ( TT\u201d) during fiscal year 2019. We are working with our banks in Trinidad to source tradeable currencies (including Euros, British Pounds, and Canadian dollars), but until the central bank in Trinidad makes more U.S. dollars available, this illiquidity condition is likely to continue. As of August 31, 2019, our Trinidad subsidiary had a net Trinidad dollar denominated asset position measured in USD of approximately $24.9 million, a decrease of $15.4 million from August 31, 2018 when our Trinidad subsidiary had net Trinidad dollar denominated asset position of approximately $40.3 million. We are carefully monitoring the situation, which may require us to limit future shipments from the U.S. to Trinidad in line with our ability to exchange Trinidad dollars for tradeable currencies to manage our exposure to any potential devaluation.\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Net merchandise sales increased 4.9% over the comparable prior year period. We ended the year with 41 warehouse clubs compared to 39 warehouse clubs at the end of the fiscal year 2017. \nComparison of 2019 and 2018\nFinancial highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 included:\nOverall, the effects of currency devaluations within our markets had an approximate $14.1 million or 50 basis point (0.5%) negative constant currency impact on net merchandise sales for the year ended August 31, 2018.\nPre-opening expense increased $1.8 million or 0.1% of total revenues compared to the prior year period. This increase is attributable to costs incurred to open our 42nd and 43rd warehouse club and for the two remaining warehouse clubs expected to open this calendar year.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nNet Merchandise Sales by Category\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations had a $37.7 million or 980 basis point (9.8%) negative constant currency impact on net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment for the year ended August 31, 2019. The currency devaluations contributed approximately 120 basis points (1.2%) to the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales.\n \u00b7 Membership income for the fiscal year 2019 increased 2.6% to $52.1 million primarily due to new member sign-ups for the club openings in Panama and the Dominican Republic. \n\ufeff\nThis annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements concerning PriceSmart, Inc.'s (\"PriceSmart\", the \"Company\" or \"we\") anticipated future revenues and earnings, adequacy of future cash flows, proposed warehouse club openings, the Company's performance relative to competitors and related matters.

The Company could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating globally and in the U.S., as well as other risks that are not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial.\n\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\nOperating income for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019, decreased to $115.2 million (3.6% of total revenue) compared to $126.1 million (4.0% of total revenue) for the same period last year. As described above, lower merchandise margins as a percent of sales, higher expenses year-on-year related to investments to expand our omni-channel capabilities and the inclusion for the full twelve months ended August 31, 2019 of the net operating results from our marketplace and casillero business acquired in March 2018 were the primary factors for the decrease in operating income.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes the cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, held by our foreign subsidiaries and domestically (in thousands).\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 and 2017 in Constant Currency\n\ufeff\nOur Caribbean segment net merchandise sales increased 6.2% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, driven by sales increases within all of our markets in the segment, with the exception of our Barbados market. The difficult economic environment that affected fiscal year 2017 has improved, though we continue to closely monitor shipments of U.S. goods into our Trinidad market, as a result of continued currency illiquidity in that market. Trinidad net merchandise sales for fiscal year 2018 increased 2.2% when compared to the same period last year. The Company is not currently limiting shipments to Trinidad, but illiquidity concerns remain, which may again cause us to restrict shipments in the future.\nShares of common stock repurchased by us are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in the reduction of stockholders' equity in our consolidated balance sheets. We may reissue these treasury shares.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in financing activities total $32.0 million and $27.8 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash flows provided or used for financing activities are used primarily to fund our working capital needs and our warehouse club expansions and investments. The $4.2 million increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily the result of a net decrease of proceeds from long-term borrowings of $9.4 million compared to a year ago as we did not have any additional long-term borrowings in fiscal year 2019. Additionally, the amount of cash we used to repurchase shares of restricted stock upon vesting to cover employees' tax withholding obligations increased $1.4 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily as a result of the acceleration of vesting as a component of severance for one of our officers. We received $7.5 million of proceeds from short-term borrowings to fund our working capital and capital investment needs, offsetting this $10.8 million of cash used.\nComparison of Fiscal Year 2019 to 2018 and Fiscal Year 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\nThe mix of sales by major category changed slightly by 1% for Fresh Foods and Hardlines between fiscal year 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\nFor the year, the negative economic conditions, foreign currency devaluation, and socio-political conditions within our Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and Nicaragua markets contributed approximately 100 basis points (1.0%) of the decrease, which was offset by a 30 basis point (0.3%) increase in Honduras and El Salvador. The Central America segment comparable merchandise sales for fiscal year 2019 were impacted by the opening of the Company's seventh warehouse club in Costa Rica in\n\n\ufeff\nMembership Income\nFinancial highlights for fiscal year 2018 included:\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Operating income for fiscal year 2019 was $115.2 million, a decrease of $10.9 million compared to fiscal year 2018. \nCurrency devaluations had a $7.7 million or 90 basis point (0.9%) negative constant currency impact on reported net merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment for the year ended August 31, 2018. The currency devaluations contributed approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) of the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales.\nCurrency fluctuations can be one of the largest variables affecting our overall sales and profit performance, as we have experienced in prior fiscal years, because many of our markets are susceptible to foreign currency exchange rate volatility. During fiscal year 2019, approximately 77.0% of our net merchandise sales were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Of those sales, 52.0% were comprised of sales of products we purchased in U.S. dollars.\n \u00b7 Merchandise gross profits (net merchandise sales less associated cost of goods sold) increased 4.9% over the same prior year period, and merchandise gross profits as a percent of net merchandise sales were 14.5% which is unchanged from fiscal year 2017. \nCurrency devaluations within our Central America segment accounted for approximately 160 basis points (1.6%) of the impact of currency devaluations on total comparable merchandise sales for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. Our Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua markets all experienced currency devaluation when compared to the same period last year.\n\ufeff\nMembership income is recognized ratably over the one-year life of the membership. The increase in membership income primarily reflects a growth in membership accounts.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFor fiscal year 2018, the effective tax rate was 39.3%. The increase in the effective rate versus the prior year was primarily attributable to the following factors:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have generally been sufficient to fund our operations and allow us to invest in activities that support long-term growth and pay dividends on our common stock. We evaluate our funding requirements on a regular basis and use long-term and short-term borrowings to cover any shortfall in our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our capital requirements. We may consider funding alternatives to provide additional liquidity when necessary.\n\ufeff\nThe mix of sales by major category remained unchanged between fiscal year 2019 and 2018.\nOther comprehensive income/(loss) for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 resulted primarily from foreign currency translation adjustments related to the assets and liabilities and the translation of the statements of income related to revenue, costs and expenses of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. When the functional currency in our international subsidiaries is the local currency and not U.S. dollars, the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period. The corresponding translation gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. These adjustments will not affect net income until the sale or liquidation of the underlying investment. The reported other comprehensive income or loss reflects the unrealized increase or decrease in the value in U.S. dollars of the net assets of the subsidiaries as of the date of the balance sheet, which will vary from period to period as exchange rates fluctuate.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparable net merchandise sales for those warehouse clubs that were open for at least 13 \u00bd months for some or all of the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018 grew 2.3%.\nComparable net merchandise sales for those warehouse clubs that were open for at least 13 \u00bd months for some or all of the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019 decreased 0.6%.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFor fiscal year 2019, the effective tax rate was 33.8%. The decrease in the effective rate versus the prior year was primarily attributable to the following factors:\nOperating income for fiscal year 2018 was $126.1 million (4.0% of total revenue) compared to $136.2 million (4.5% of total revenue) for the same period last year. Within our Central America segment, higher expenses related to the addition of a new warehouse club coupled with lower sales volumes within our Panama and Nicaragua markets accounted for forty basis points (0.4%) of the decrease in operating income to total revenues. Additionally, the increase of approximately $16.1 million in total selling, general and administrative costs due to the additional costs of our Aeropost subsidiary, which are recorded within our U.S. segment, were the primary drivers of our decreased operating income by an additional thirty basis points (0.3%). These decreases were partially offset by an increase of operating income within our Colombia segment of 0.2% of total revenue, primarily due to increases in sales from the continued improved economic conditions in Colombia.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n \u00b7 Net merchandise sales increased 1.2% over the comparable prior year period. We ended the year with 43 warehouse clubs compared to 41 warehouse clubs at the end of the fiscal year 2018. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by 3.2%. \n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations within our Colombia segment accounted for approximately 130 basis points (1.3%) of the impact of currency devaluations on total comparable merchandise sales for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. This reflects the devaluation of the Colombia peso when compared to the same period a year ago.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCurrency appreciation had a $7.6 million or 20 basis point (0.2%) positive constant currency impact on net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment for the year ended August 31, 2018. The currency appreciations contributed approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) to the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n \u00b7 Currency exchange transactions in the current year resulted in a $1.5 million net currency loss compared to a $192,000 net gain from currency exchange transactions last year primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Colombia. \n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\nIn 2017, we began evaluating options to replace our existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. We have deferred that decision in order to more holistically assess our overall IT landscape and strategy. Nevertheless, we continue to enhance our IT systems and infrastructure to respond to evolving business requirements in a manner we believe to be consistent with a future ERP migration process.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nAt the vesting dates for restricted stock awards to our employees, we repurchase a portion of the shares that have vested at the prior day's closing price per share, with the funds used to pay the employees' minimum statutory tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of restricted stock awards. We do not have a stock repurchase program.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOther Income (Expense), net\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nCurrent and Future Management Actions\nThe following discussion and analysis compares the results of operations for each of the three fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. Unless otherwise noted, all tables present U.S. dollar amounts in thousands. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Our operations consist of four reportable segments: Central America, the Caribbean, Colombia and the United States. The Company's reportable segments are based on management's organization of these locations into operating segments by general geographic location, which are used by management and the Company's chief operating decision maker in setting up management lines of responsibility, providing support services, and making operational decisions and assessments of financial performance. Segment amounts are presented after converting to U.S. dollars and consolidating eliminations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.\n \u00b7 Comparable net merchandise sales (that is, sales in the warehouse clubs that have been open for greater than 13 \u00bd calendar months) for the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2019 increased 1.5%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted comparable net merchandise sales negatively by 2.7%. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Total revenues increased 1.8% over the comparable prior year period. Net merchandise sales contributed 120 basis points (1.2%) of the increase and the remaining 60 basis points (0.6%) increase resulted from the inclusion of the full-year revenues from the marketplace and casillero operations that we acquired in March 2018. \nNet Merchandise Sales\nan area called Santa Ana. Often times, new warehouse clubs that we open are not far from existing warehouse clubs that are included in the calculation for comparable net merchandise sales, resulting in a transfer of some sales from an existing club (in this case Escazu) to the new club. This transfer of sales from existing warehouse clubs that are included in the calculation of comparable net merchandise sales to new warehouse clubs that are not included in the calculation can have an adverse impact on reported comparable net merchandise sales. We estimate that the transfer of sales associated with the Santa Ana opening negatively impacted the comparable net merchandise sales for the Central America segment by 50 basis points (0.5%). New warehouse clubs attract new members from areas not previously served by us and also create the opportunity for some existing members, particularly those who now find the new clubs closer to their homes, to shop more frequently.\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Net income attributable to PriceSmart for fiscal year 2018 was $74.3 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, compared to $90.7 million, or $2.98 per diluted share, in the prior year. \n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations within our Colombia segment accounted for approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) of positive impact of currency appreciation on total comparable merchandise sales for the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018. This reflects the appreciation of the Colombia peso when compared to the same period a year ago.\n \u00b7 Membership income for the fiscal year 2018 increased 6.4% to $50.8 million. \n\ufeff\n 2. The comparably favorable net impact of 2.4%, resulting from the U.S. Tax Reform current rate reduction which favorably impacted our effective tax rate by 2.6%, partially offset by an unfavorable re-measurement of net deferred tax assets/liabilities of 0.2%. \nWe are investing in digital transformation, including omni-channel capabilities that enable e-commerce, by integrating technology, talent, supply chain and operations to enhance the membership shopping experience, drive efficiencies and fuel sales growth. Our focus will be on launching these omni-channel capabilities in a methodical phased manner.\n \u00b7 Currency exchange transactions in the current year resulted in a $192,000 net currency gain compared to a $1.2 million net gain from currency exchange transactions in the prior year. \n\ufeff\nAdditionally, during fiscal year 2018, we began to expand our Platinum membership program. We began offering Platinum memberships in Costa Rica during fiscal year 2013 and added Panama, Dominican Republic and Trinidad during fiscal year 2018. We began offering Platinum memberships in the United States Virgin Island in October 2018 (fiscal year 2019).\nGeneral Market Factors\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nA devaluation of local currency reduces the value of sales and membership income that is generated in that country when translated to U.S. dollars for our consolidated results. In addition, when local currency experiences devaluation, we may elect to increase the local currency price of imported merchandise to maintain our target margins, which could impact demand for the merchandise affected by the price increase. We may also modify the mix of imported versus local merchandise and/or the source of imported merchandise to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations. Information about the effect of local currency devaluations is discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Net Merchandise Sales and Comparable Sales.\u201d\n\ufeff\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on its financial condition or consolidated financial statements.\nShort-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt\nOur sales and profits vary from market to market depending on general economic factors, including GDP growth; consumer preferences; foreign currency exchange rates; political policies and social conditions; local demographic characteristics (such as population growth); the number of years we have operated in a particular market; and the level of retail and wholesale competition in that market.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nGross margin on merchandise sales as a percentage of total revenue remained unchanged at 14.5% for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018 compared to the twelve month period ended August 31, 2017. Total gross margin to total revenues increased to 16.1% from 15.9% for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, mainly due to higher margins on nonmerchandise revenues of our Aeropost subsidiary, which increased the gross margin on total revenues, by approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) for the year. Membership income, rental income and miscellaneous income gross margin remained unchanged\nSeasonality\n\ufeff\nThe following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nFor the twelve-month period ended August 31, 2019, we had a net expense associated with foreign currency transactions of approximately $1.5 million, of which our Jamaica and Dominican Republic markets contributed $687,000 and $519,000, respectively. The main drivers for the year-to-date period loss is attributable to significant increases in our average U.S. dollar asset position in Jamaica and our average U.S. dollar liability position in the Dominican Republic compared to a year ago. We increased these positions to provide capital resources for our current and future warehouse club construction activities and other investments. In Jamaica our average U.S. dollar asset position was $19.8 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to $16.6 million in fiscal year 2018, or a 19% increase year-over-year. In the Dominican Republic our average U.S. dollar liability position was $26.6 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to $8.0 million in fiscal year 2018, or a 235% increase year-over-year.\nWe accrue an amount for our estimate of probable additional income tax liability. In certain cases, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has 50% or less likelihood of being sustained. This requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. There were no material changes in our uncertain income tax positions for the periods ended on August 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\ufeff\n\n \u00b7 Short-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other current assets: This classification is used for any countries where our subsidiary has generally demonstrated the ability to recover the VAT or income tax receivable within one year. We also classify as short-term any approved refunds or credit notes to the extent that we expect to receive the refund or use the credit notes within one year. \n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations within our Central America segment accounted for approximately 40 basis points (0.4%) of the impact of currency devaluations on total comparable merchandise sales for the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018. Our Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras markets all experienced currency devaluation when compared to the same period last year.\n \u00b7 Merchandise gross profits (net merchandise sales less associated cost of goods sold) decreased 0.2% over the same prior year period, and merchandise gross profits as a percent of net merchandise sales were 14.3%, a decrease of 20 basis points (0.2%) from the same period last year. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparable Merchandise Sales\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Some of our accounting policies require management to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to business acquisitions, contingencies and litigation, income taxes, value added taxes, and long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Using different estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n 1. The comparably unfavorable impact of 10.2% resulting from the U.S. Tax Reform Transition Tax in fiscal year 2018. \nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates\u201d refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activities translated using the current period's currency exchange rates, and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand our underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the largest translation adjustments were related to the translation of the Colombia, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua subsidiaries' balance sheets and statements of income that required us to record additional losses, when compared to the prior year, to comprehensive net income on translation of approximately $19.4 million. Additionally, there was a comprehensive loss of approximately $3.3 million related to unrealized losses on changes in derivative obligations due to declining benchmark interest rates.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017 in Constant Currency\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations within our Caribbean segment accounted for approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) of the impact of currency devaluations on total comparable merchandise for the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018. This is reflective of the offsetting devaluation and appreciation of the mix of currencies within the markets in this segment when compared to the same period a year ago.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNet interest expense reflects borrowings by PriceSmart, Inc. and our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries to finance new land acquisition and construction for new warehouse clubs, warehouse club expansions and distribution centers, the capital requirements of warehouse club and other operations and ongoing working capital requirements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of warehouse club and other operations, general and administrative expenses, pre-opening expenses, asset impairment and loss/(gain) on disposal of assets. In total, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $43.5 million to 12.1% of total revenues, an increase of 70 basis points (0.7%) compared to 11.4% of total revenues in fiscal year 2017. Warehouse club and other operations contributed 20 basis points (0.2%) of this increase. This was mainly due to approximately $6.4 million (0.2% of total revenues) in additional other operational costs associated with our Aeropost subsidiary during fiscal year 2018. General and administrative expenses contributed the remaining 50 basis points (0.5%) of the year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue, with $9.7 million in general and administrative costs associated with Aeropost contributing 30 basis points (0.3%) of this increase. The $9.7 million was composed of $1.1 million in amortization of technology intangibles, $1.4 million in amortization of post-combination compensation costs, and $7.2 million of other general and administrative costs. We also recorded in general and administrative expense during fiscal year 2018 $669,000 in acquisition costs, including legal, accounting and technical consulting related to the acquisition of Aeropost. Additionally, general and administrative expenses also grew as a percentage to total revenues due to increased staffing in our buying department and increased information technology costs. Asset impairment charges for approximately $1.4 million, net of tax benefit, were related to the write-off of costs for a software platform\n \u00b7 We recorded a $454,000 net currency gain from currency transactions in the current quarter compared to a $211,000 net currency gain in the same period last year, primarily due to a favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation in Jamaica. \n \u00b7 Operating income for fiscal year 2018 was $126.1 million, a decrease of $10.2 million compared to fiscal year 2017. \n \u00b7 the asset's inability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; \n\ufeff\nOverall, the effects of currency devaluations within our markets had an approximate $97.3 million or 320 basis point (3.2%) negative constant currency impact on net merchandise sales for the year ended August 31, 2019.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:\nTotal gross margin to total revenues increased 30 basis points (0.3%) for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019. The year to date increase is due to six and a half months of additional revenue of our marketplace and casillero business compared to the prior year, which increased the gross margin to total revenues ratio by approximately 30 basis points (0.3%). Membership income, rental income and miscellaneous income gross margin percentage remained unchanged. The reclassification of income generated from the IGP as a result of the implementation of new revenue recognition standards along with a refund payment from a credit card vendor increased total gross margins by approximately 20 basis points (0.2%) for the year to date period. This 50 basis point (0.5%) increase was offset by a net merchandise sales gross margin decline of 20 basis points (0.2%).\n\ufeff\n 3. The comparably unfavorable impact of 1.0% resulting from the effective tax rate impact of costs incurred to expand our omni-channel capabilities and the net operating results of our marketplace and casillero business. \n\ufeff\n\n\n\ufeff\n 5. The comparatively unfavorable impact on the effective tax rate of 0.9% resulting from a decrease in fiscal year 2019 in the magnitude of an intercompany transaction between PriceSmart, Inc. and our Colombian subsidiary in support of PriceSmart's ongoing market development and growth in Colombia compared to the prior year. The Company does not expect these intercompany transactions to continue in the future. \n (2) Warehouse club square feet at period end has been updated to reflect sales floor square feet vs. total building square feet to align with industry standards. \n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 and 2017\n\ufeff\nPlease refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 13 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for further discussion.\n \u00b7 significant changes in its strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and \nNet merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment grew 6.2% for fiscal year 2019, when compared to fiscal year 2018. This increase had a 170 basis point (1.7%) positive impact on total net merchandise sales growth. Our Jamaica and Dominican Republic markets led the way in this segment by having 11.5% and 11.6% growth, respectively. In the Dominican Republic, we launched our fifth club in June 2019, while Jamaica had exceptional comparable net merchandise sales growth of 11.6%. With the exception of our Barbados market, all other markets within this segment showed increased net merchandise sales year-on-year.\nTax Receivables\nFrom time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar illiquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to settle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products. Since fiscal year 2017, we have experienced this situation in Trinidad and have been unable to source a sufficient level of tradeable currencies in Trinidad. We are working with our banks in Trinidad to source tradeable currencies. We expect the illiquid market conditions in Trinidad to continue.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDemographic characteristics within each of our markets can also affect both the overall level of sales and also future sales growth opportunities. Island countries such as Aruba, Barbados and the U.S. Virgin Islands offer us limited upside for sales growth given their overall market size. Countries with a smaller upper and middle class consumer population, such as Honduras, El Salvador, Jamaica and Nicaragua, offer growth potential but they may have a more limited potential opportunity for sales growth as compared to more developed countries with larger upper and middle class consumer populations.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Total revenues increased 3.0% over the comparable prior year period. Net merchandise sales contributed 400 basis points (4.0%) to this increase; however, this increase was offset by a decrease in export sales, which contributed a 100 basis points (1.0%) decrease to total revenues. \nRepurchase of Equity Securities and Reissuance of Treasury Shares\nNet merchandise sales in our Central America segment increased 2.8% for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. General weakness in Panama, one of our largest markets in that segment, and social unrest starting in May 2018 within our Nicaragua market, resulted in negative combined growth within those two countries of 0.7% when compared to the prior year. All other Central American markets recorded positive growth in warehouse sales for the twelve-month period, with Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador together recording sales growth of greater than 3.5%.\nOur policy for classification and presentation of VAT receivables, income tax receivables and other tax receivables is as follows:\nLong-lived Assets\nIn the Central America segment, we estimate that cannibalization from the opening of the Company's seventh warehouse club in Costa Rica negatively impacted the comparable net merchandise sales by 180 basis points (1.8%). New warehouse clubs attract new members from areas not previously served by us and also create the opportunity for some existing members, particularly those who now find the new clubs closer to their homes, to shop more frequently. Additionally, general weakness in Panama, one of our largest markets in this segment, and social unrest starting in May 2018 within our Nicaragua market impacted comparable net merchandise sales by approximately 70 basis points (0.7%).\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $170.3 million and $119.5 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net merchandise sales and membership fees. Cash flows used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs (including payroll, employee benefits and utilities), as well as payments for income taxes. The $50.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase of accounts payable of $25.3 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to a decrease in accounts payable of $16.5 million in fiscal year 2018, which resulted in a $41.8 million change year-over-year. In addition, the net increase in other current and non-current assets and liabilities resulted in a $16.1 million change year-over-year. The accounts payable increase resulted from several factors, including a shift in the timing of inventory purchases in anticipation of the holiday season versus a year ago and working capital efficiency improvements. The other current and non-current assets and liabilities decrease is primarily the result of increases in salary and benefit accruals, deferred income, and other accruals due to the opening of two new clubs, which added additional headcount and membership income.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. \n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations within our Caribbean segment accounted for approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) of the impact of currency devaluations on total comparable merchandise for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. Our Dominican Republic and Jamaica markets experienced currency devaluation when compared to the same period last year.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Membership income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 increased 4.2% to $13.4 million primarily due to new member sign-ups for the club openings in Panama and the Dominican Republic. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\n\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\n (1) The reconciling items reflect the amount eliminated on consolidation of intersegment transactions. \nOn a consolidated basis, net merchandise sales gross margin for fiscal year 2019 as a percentage of total net merchandise sales were 14.3%, 20 basis points (0.2%) lower than fiscal year 2018. Net merchandise margins decreased across all segments with the Central America segment contributing 10 basis points (0.1%), the Caribbean segment contributing 10 basis points (0.1%), and the Colombia segment contributed an immaterial amount to the overall decline. The 20 basis point (0.2%) decline compared to the prior year is a 30 basis point (0.3%) improvement from the nine-month period end May 31, 2019 when the year over year decline was 50 basis points (0.5%).\nComparable net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment decreased 0.3% for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. The decrease had an immaterial negative impact in total comparable sales. The decline was largely due to the significantly unfavorable devaluation of the Colombia peso relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, one or more markets in which we operate may experience economic slowdowns, which can negatively impact our business. Most countries in our Central America segment experienced general market conditions that resulted in a difficult operating environment during fiscal year 2019. Increasing foreign currency exchange volatility, slowing global economy activity and trade, decreasing levels of public investment and tax reform stalled economic growth for most of our countries in this region. Our Colombia segment, in particular, experienced significant foreign currency exchange volatility during fiscal year 2019, which negatively affected reported sales growth for that segment.\n\ufeff\n\n 4. The comparably favorable impact of 1.3% resulting from the reversal of valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets in the Company's Colombia subsidiary, due to the ongoing improvement in our business in Colombia. \n (1) Our marketplace and casillero business was acquired in March 2018. This impact represents five and a half months of activity versus the entire twelve months of activity in the current year. \nDuring fiscal year 2018, the largest translation adjustments were related to the translation of the Colombia, Dominican Republic and Jamaica subsidiaries' balance sheets and statements of income that required us to record additional losses, when compared to the prior year, to comprehensive net income on translation of approximately $8.5 million.\nThe following table indicates the comparable net merchandise sales in the reportable segments in which we operate and the percentage growth in net merchandise sales by segment during fiscal years 2019 and 2018.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n 4. The comparatively unfavorable impact on the effective tax rate of 1.0% resulting from a decrease in fiscal year 2018 in the magnitude of an intercompany transaction between PriceSmart, Inc. and our Colombian subsidiary in support of PriceSmart's ongoing market development and growth in Colombia compared to the prior year. The intercompany transaction reduces taxable income in the U.S. and increases taxable income in our Colombia subsidiary where the additional taxable income is fully offset by the reversal of valuation allowances on accumulated net losses in that subsidiary. We expect the decrease of the favorable impact to the consolidated Company's effective tax rate to continue into fiscal year 2019. \n{\n\ufeff\nMission and Business Strategy\nthat was under development prior to the acquisition of Aeropost, because of Aeropost's Information Technology ( IT\u201d) platform and IT development capability.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\ufeff\nTotal revenue increased 5.7% from the twelve months ended August 31, 2017 to the same period ended August 31, 2018, year on year increases to net merchandise sales contributed 480 basis points (4.8%), non-merchandise revenue from Aeropost contributed 60 basis points (0.6%), increased export sales contributed 20 basis points (0.2%) and increased membership income contributed ten basis points (0.1%).\nOther Revenue\nManagement's judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation and can include management's best estimate of future business activity, which in turn drives estimates of future cash flows from these assets. These periodic evaluations could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value. Future business conditions and/or activity could differ materially from the projections made by management causing the need for additional impairment charges. No impairment charges have been recorded during fiscal year 2019 related to the loss of legal ownership or title to assets; significant changes in the Company's strategic business objectives or utilization of assets; or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. Loss/(gain) on disposal of assets recorded during the years reported resulted from improvements to operations and normal preventive maintenance.\n\ufeff\nThe following table indicates the impact that currency exchange rates had on our net merchandise sales in dollars and the percentage change from the year ended August 31, 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur Colombia segment's net merchandise sales increased 13.1% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. With the stabilization of the exchange rate between the Colombian peso and the U.S. dollar over the past two years, we have seen an improving sales picture in all of our warehouse clubs in Colombia. This, coupled with our efforts to source high quality merchandise from local suppliers, resulted in an 8.9% increase in transactions in the fiscal year and average ticket growth of 3.9%.\n\ufeff\nOverall net merchandise sales grew by 1.2% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, resulting from a 2.9% increase in transactions offset by a 1.7% decrease in average ticket. In addition, we had 43 clubs in operation as of August 31, 2019 compared to 41 clubs as of August 31, 2018.\nWe reissued 63,000 treasury shares as part of our stock-based compensation programs during fiscal year 2019, but we did not reissue any treasury shares during fiscal years 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther revenue primarily consists of non-merchandise revenue from freight and handling fees generated from our marketplace and casillero operations, interest-generating portfolio from our co-branded credit cards, and rental income from operating leases where the Company is the lessor.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe report comparable net merchandise sales on a same week\u201d basis with 13 weeks in each quarter beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday. The periods are established at the beginning of the fiscal year to provide as close a match as possible to the calendar month and quarter that is used for financial reporting purposes. This approach equalizes the number of weekend days and weekdays in each period for improved sales comparison, as we experience higher merchandise club sales on the weekends. Each of the warehouse clubs used in the calculations was open for at least 13 \u00bd calendar months before its results for the current period were compared with its results for the prior period. For example, sales related to our warehouse club in Panama opened on May 1, 2019 will not be used in the calculation of comparable sales until July 2020, and the sales related to our warehouse club opened in the Dominican Republic on June 27, 2019 will not be used in the calculation of comparable sales until September 2020. Therefore, comparable net merchandise sales includes 41 warehouse clubs for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019.\n", "item_7_text": " \u00b7 Merchandise gross profits (net merchandise sales less associated cost of goods sold) in the quarter increased 7.1% over the prior-year period, and merchandise gross profits as a percent of net merchandise sales were 15.2%, an increase of 50 basis points (0.5%) from the same period in the prior year. \nIn most countries where we operate, the VAT refund process is defined and structured with regular refunds or offsets. However, we, together with our tax and legal advisers, are currently seeking clarification in court and pursuing other alternatives in one country without a clearly defined process and expect to prevail. The balance of the VAT receivable in the country with undefined refund mechanisms was approximately $5.1 million and $3.1 million as of August 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively. In another country in which we have warehouse clubs, beginning in fiscal year 2015, a new minimum income tax mechanism took effect, which requires us to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales rather than income. As a result, we are making income tax payments substantially in excess of those we would expect to pay based on taxable income. The rules (which we have challenged in court), effective for fiscal years 2015 to 2018, do not clearly allow us to obtain a refund or offset this excess income tax against other taxes. As of August 31, 2019, we had deferred tax assets of approximately $2.6 million in this country. Also, we had an income tax receivable balance of $7.8 million as of August 31, 2019 related to excess payments from fiscal year 2015 to 2019. In fiscal year 2018, a revised minimum tax law was passed in this country, which beginning in fiscal year 2020 will reduce the minimum tax rate. Additionally, this law clarifies on a go-forward basis the reimbursement process for excess minimum tax paid beginning in fiscal year 2019, but does not address periods prior to fiscal year 2019. Nevertheless, we have not placed any type of allowance on the recoverability of these tax receivables or deferred tax assets, because we believe that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately succeed in our refund requests, related appeals and/or court challenge on this matter.\n\ufeff\nWe measure our growth primarily by the amount of the period-over-period activity in our net merchandise sales, our comparable store net merchandise sales and our membership income. Our investments are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. These investments can impact near-term results, such as when we incur fixed costs in advance of achieving full projected sales, negatively impacting near-term operating profit and net income, or when we open a new warehouse club in an existing market, which can reduce reported comparable net merchandise sales due to the transfer of sales from existing warehouse clubs.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n 5. The comparably unfavorable impact of 1.6% resulting from the Company's Aeropost subsidiary's overall effective tax rate and acquisition-related accounting. \nWe pay Value Added Tax ( VAT\u201d) or similar taxes ( input VAT\u201d), income taxes, and other taxes within the normal course of our business in most of the countries in which we operate related to the procurement of merchandise and/or services we acquire and/or on sales and taxable income. We also collect VAT or similar taxes on behalf of the government ( output VAT\u201d) for merchandise and/or services we sell. If the output VAT exceeds the input VAT, then the difference is remitted to the government, usually on a monthly basis. If the input VAT exceeds the output VAT, this creates a VAT receivable. In most countries where we operate, the governments have implemented additional collection procedures, such as requiring credit card processors to remit a portion of sales processed via credit card directly to the government as advance payments of VAT and/or income tax. In the case of VAT, these procedures alter the natural offset of input and output VAT and generally leave us with a net VAT receivable, forcing us to process significant refund claims on a recurring basis. With respect to income taxes paid, if the estimated income taxes paid or withheld exceed the actual income tax due this creates an income tax receivable. We either request a refund of these tax receivables or apply the balance to expected future tax payments. These refund or offset processes can take anywhere from several months to several years to complete.\n\ufeff\n 6. The comparably unfavorable impact of 0.7% resulting from severance compensation of one of our officers. \n\ufeff\nOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets while minimizing our borrowing costs. The proceeds of these borrowings were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Please see Item 8 Note 11 - Debt for further discussion.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes the costs recorded as part of our consolidation of Aeropost-related activities (net of tax benefit), including costs to expand our omni-channel capabilities, the net operating results of our marketplace and casillero business and ongoing costs we recorded as part of our post-acquisition purchase accounting.\n\ufeff\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nU.S. Tax Reform in December 2017 lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and made numerous other law changes.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nDividends\n \u00b7 The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was 33.8%, as compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 of 39.3%. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the nonrecurrence of the U.S. Tax Reform Transition Tax and the U.S. Tax Reform rate reduction and tax incentives, offset by the unfavorable impact from valuation allowances on deferred tax assets from excess foreign tax credits that, incidental to U.S. Tax Reform, are no longer deemed recoverable. \nThe number of member accounts during fiscal year 2018 was 3.4% higher than the year before. Membership income increased 6.4%.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOverall net merchandise sales grew by 4.9% for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, resulting from a 3.7% increase in transactions and a 1.2% increase in average ticket.\n\ufeff\nWe are required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. The preparation of these tax returns requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by us. We, in consultation with our tax advisors, base our tax returns on interpretations that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The tax returns, however, are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we file our tax returns. As part of these reviews, a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the interpretations we used to calculate our tax liability and therefore require us to pay additional taxes.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\n\nComparable net merchandise sales in our Central America segment decreased 2.0% for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. This decrease contributed approximately 120 basis points (1.2%) of the decrease in total comparable merchandise sales.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\n(Amounts in thousands, except percentages and number of warehouse clubs)\nDerivatives\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Net merchandise sales increased 3.7% over the comparable prior year period. We ended the quarter with 43 warehouse clubs compared to 41 warehouse clubs at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by 2.6%. \nComparison of 2019 to 2018\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nHistorically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political events in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix, and currency effects on the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and therefore more or less affordable. Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition, there can be no assurance that our future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe following tables indicate the net merchandise club sales in the reportable segments in which we operate, and the percentage growth in net merchandise sales by segment during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\n\ufeff\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included therein.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\nComparison of 2019 to 2018 in Constant Currency\n \u00b7 Net income attributable to PriceSmart for fiscal year 2019 was $73.2 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, compared to $74.3 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, in the prior year. \nResults of Operations\nAdditionally, we continued expanding our Platinum membership program. We began offering Platinum memberships in Honduras, Jamaica, Aruba, USVI and Barbados in fiscal year 2019.\nThe opening of our fourth and fifth warehouse clubs in the Dominican Republic in May 2018 and June 2019 impacted this segment's comparable merchandise sales. We estimate that the transfer of sales associated with the opening of these warehouse clubs negatively impacted the Caribbean segment comparable merchandise sales by 160 basis points (1.6%) for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. All other markets in this segment, with the exception of Barbados, showed strong growth compared to the prior year. Notably, investments we made in our Jamaica market contributed to growth of 11.6% in comparable net merchandise sales during the year.\nComparable net merchandise sales included 39 warehouse clubs for the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018. The following table illustrates the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our comparable merchandise sales in dollars and the percentage change from the fifty-two week periods ended September 2, 2018.\nNet interest expense for the year ended August 31, 2018 decreased $1.7 million when compared to prior year. Loans decreased year-on-year primarily due to the pay-off of loans within our subsidiaries. Lower average loan balance on both long-term and short-term loans were partially offset by higher variable ( LIBOR\u201d) interest rates. Interest expense related to hedging activity decreased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 due to the pay-off of the various loans held by our subsidiaries that were hedged and the remaining hedged loans having positive ( in the money\u201d) positions. Additional capitalized interest in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 resulted from higher levels of construction activities.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n \u00b7 Comparable net merchandise sales (that is, sales in the warehouse clubs that have been open for greater than 13 \u00bd calendar months) for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2019 decreased 0.6%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted comparable net merchandise sales negatively by 3.2%. \nThe growth in membership accounts during fiscal year 2019 in our Caribbean market was primarily attributable to the opening of the new Bolivar warehouse club in the Dominican Republic in June 2019. Membership accounts in Colombia increased during the same period primarily due to an improving economy and the continued growth in the market's acceptance of the warehouse club concept. Membership accounts in Central America increased during the same period primarily due to the opening of the new Veraguas warehouse club in Panama in May 2019. The Company's twelve-month renewal rate increased to 85.7% for the year ended August 31, 2019 from 85.1% for the year ended August 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\n (2) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by approximately $2.3 million to reflect the amounts net of expected sublease income. Operating lease obligations include $1.6 million of lease payment obligations for the prior leased Miami distribution center. For the purposes of calculating the minimum lease payments, a reduction is reflected for the actual sublease income the Company expects to receive during the remaining lease term. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nColombia recorded the highest comparable merchandise club sales of 13.4%. The comparable warehouse sales growth benefitted from continued stability in the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar.\n \u00b7 Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 was $32.0 million, an increase of $4.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. \n\ufeff\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity (primarily U.S. dollars) are revalued to the functional currency using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. These foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) are recorded as currency gains or losses. Additionally, gains or losses from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity also generate currency gains or losses.\nNet merchandise sales in our Central America segment decreased 0.9% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. These declines had a 50 basis point (0.5%) negative impact on total net merchandise sales growth. Economic weakness, currency devaluation and political instability led to decreased sales within our Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and Nicaragua markets, offset by year-on-year increased merchandise sales within our El Salvador and Honduras markets.\n \u00b7 Total revenues increased 5.7% over the comparable prior year period. 0.6% of this increase was the result of approximately $16.9 million in non-merchandise revenue from our Aeropost operations acquired in March 2018. \nWarehouse club and other operations expense increased to 9.5% of total revenues compared to 9.2% for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2019. Our marketplace and casillero business added approximately $9.9 million or 30 basis points (0.3%) for the twelve-month period due to six and a half months of additional non-merchandise operations expense of our marketplace and casillero business compared to the prior year.\nGrowth\n\ufeff\nWe periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. Indicators that an asset may be impaired are:\n 3. The comparably favorable impact of 1.6% resulting from improved financial results in the Company's Colombia subsidiary for which no tax attribute was recognized, net of adjustment to valuation allowance. \n\ufeff\nThe tables below summarize the effective tax rate for the periods reported:\nCurrency devaluations had a $48.6 million or 270 basis point (2.7%) negative constant currency impact on net merchandise sales in our Central America segment for the year ended August 31, 2019. The currency devaluations contributed approximately 160 basis points (1.6%) of the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales. Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and our Nicaragua markets all experienced currency devaluation when compared to the same period last year.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to 3.1% compared to 2.8% for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2019. Our investments to expand our omni-channel capabilities, together with our marketplace and casillero business added approximately $9.8 million or 30 basis points (0.3%), in costs to this line item for the twelve-month period. Additionally, in the first fiscal quarter was a $3.8 million, separation and other related termination benefits charge for our former Chief Executive Officer and President who resigned in October 2018 by mutual agreement with the Board of Directors.\nThe following table indicates the impact that currency exchange rates had on our net merchandise sales in dollars and the percentage change from the year ended August 31, 2019.\nOur capture of total retail and wholesale sales can vary from market to market due to competition and the availability of other shopping options for our members. In larger, more developed countries, such as Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Panama and Colombia, customers may have more alternatives available to them to satisfy their shopping needs, than in other smaller countries, such as Jamaica and Nicaragua, where consumers have a limited number of shopping options.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n (3) The amounts shown represent contractual obligations for construction services not yet rendered. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Long-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other non-current assets: This classification is used for amounts not approved for refund or credit in countries where our subsidiary has not demonstrated the ability to obtain refunds within one year and/or for amounts which are subject to outstanding disputes. An allowance is provided against VAT and income tax receivable balances in dispute when we do not expect to eventually prevail in our recovery of such balances. We do not currently have any allowances provided against VAT and income tax receivables. \nOther income consists of currency gain or loss, as well as net benefit costs related to our defined benefit plans.\n\ufeff\nThe growth in membership accounts during fiscal year 2018 within our Central America and Caribbean segments is primarily the result of the addition of a new warehouse club within each segment. We opened a new warehouse club in Santa Ana, Costa Rica in October 2017 (fiscal year 2018), bringing the total of warehouse clubs operating in Costa Rica to seven. In May 2018, we opened a new warehouse club in the Dominican Republic. This brought the number of PriceSmart warehouse clubs operating in Dominican Republic to four. The growth in membership accounts during fiscal year 2018 in our Colombia market was primarily attributable to an improving economy and the continued growth in the market's acceptance of the warehouse club concept. The Company's twelve-month renewal rate for the periods ended August 31, 2018 and 2017 remained steady at 85%.\nCurrency devaluations had a $14.1 million or 80 basis point (0.8%) negative constant currency impact on net merchandise sales in our Central America segment for the year ended August 31, 2018. The currency devaluations contributed approximately 50 basis points (0.5%) of the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales.\n\nOverall, the effects of currency devaluations within our markets had an approximate $96.0 million, or 320 basis point (3.2%), negative constant currency impact on comparable net merchandise for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019.\n\nPurchasing land and constructing warehouse clubs is generally our largest ongoing capital investment. Securing land for warehouse club locations is challenging within our markets, especially in Colombia, because suitable sites at economically feasible prices are difficult to find. We believe real estate ownership provides a number of advantages as compared to leasing, including lower operating expenses, flexibility to expand or otherwise enhance our buildings, long-term control over the use of the property and the residual value that the real estate may have in future years. While our preference is to own rather than lease real estate, we have entered into real estate leases in certain cases and will likely do so in the future.\n\n 2. The comparably unfavorable net impact of 3.5%, resulting from the favorable impact of 2.6% resulting from new export-related sales and service tax incentives; and the unfavorable impact of 6.1% from valuation allowances on deferred tax assets from foreign tax credits that, incidental to U.S. Tax Reform, are no longer deemed recoverable. \nComparison of 2019 and 2018 in Constant Currency\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Our effective tax rate increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 to 34.1% from 27.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the unfavorable impact from valuation allowances on deferred tax assets from foreign tax credits that, incidental to U.S. Tax Reform, are no longer deemed recoverable, offset by U.S. Tax Reform rate reduction and tax incentives. \nFinancial Position and Cash Flow\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nOverall, the effects of currency devaluations within our markets had an approximate $12.9 million, or 40 basis point (0.4%), negative constant currency impact on comparable net merchandise for the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations Consolidated\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe Caribbean segment experienced positive comparable merchandise sales for fiscal year 2018, on improving conditions in all markets compared to the year earlier period, particularly Trinidad, Dominican Republic, Jamaica and USVI.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Comparable net merchandise sales (that is, sales in the warehouse clubs that have been open for greater than 13 \u00bd calendar months) for the 52 weeks ended September 2, 2018 increased 2.3%. \nPlease refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6 - Stockholders' Equity for further discussion.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; \n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $124.7 million and $153.8 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash used in investing activities is primarily for the construction of and improvements to our warehouse clubs. The $29.1 million decrease in investing activities is the result of a net $47.6 million decrease in certificate of deposits purchases and settlements compared to a year-ago and a $23.9 million decrease in acquisition activity versus a year-ago as we made no acquisitions in fiscal year 2019 offset by $42.0 million of additional construction expenditures and land purchases made for our expected future warehouse club openings.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\nThe number of member accounts during fiscal year 2019 was 2.5% higher than the year before. Membership income increased 2.6% over the same period.\n\nComparable net merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment increased 2.2% for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. This increase contributed approximately 60 basis points (0.6%) of positive impact in total comparable merchandise sales.\n\ufeff\n (1) Long-term debt includes debt with both fixed and variable interest rates. We have used rates as of August 31, 2019 to calculate future estimated payments related to the variable rate items. For the portion of the loans subject to interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, we have used the fixed interest rate as set by the interest rate swaps. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOther revenue for the year ended August 31, 2018, includes non-merchandise revenue generated by our marketplace and casillero operations primarily from freight and handlings charges for online orders placed from customers in Latin America to retailers in the United States and delivered to locations throughout Latin America from a business we acquired in March 2018. Rental income and miscellaneous income had no material changes when compared to the prior year.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nLogistics and distribution efficiencies are fundamental to delivering high quality merchandise at low prices to our members. We continue to explore ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs and ensure a good flow of merchandise to our warehouse clubs. As we continue to refine our logistics and distribution infrastructure, we are exploring ways to improve our supply chain effectiveness through regional distribution centers that place our merchandise closer to our members.\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\nThe table below summarizes the effect that U.S. Tax Reform had on net income and earnings per share attributable to PriceSmart available for distribution:\nOur mission is to improve the quality of life for our business and family members. To do this, we make available a wide range of high quality merchandise sourced from around the world at exceptional values. The annual membership fee enables us to operate our business, offer a tailored selection of products, and services, with lower margins than traditional retail stores. Through the use of technology and the development of an omni-channel platform, we are pursuing opportunities to respond to how our members expect to shop, create additional efficiencies in the supply chain and increase our significance in our members' lives. We are working to create a shopping experience that blends the attributes and appeal of our brick and mortar business with the conveniences associated with technology-supported transactions and online shopping.\n\ufeff\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. As of August 31, 2019, we evaluated our deferred tax assets and liabilities and determined that a valuation allowance was necessary for certain deferred tax asset balances, primarily because of the existence of significant negative objective evidence, such as the fact that certain subsidiaries are in a cumulative loss position for the past three years, indicating that certain net operating loss carry-forward periods are not sufficient to realize the related deferred tax assets. We also specifically considered whether foreign tax credit balances could be utilized in the foreseeable future in light of current and future U.S. tax liabilities. We have historically applied foreign tax credits, generated from taxes withheld on certain payments PriceSmart receives from our foreign subsidiaries, to reduce U.S. income tax liabilities. However, as an incidental result of U.S. tax reform, following the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, we expect foreign tax credits generated to exceed U.S. income tax liability for the foreseeable future. Therefore, as of August 31, 2019, we have recorded valuation allowance of $6.7 million against our foreign tax credits.\n\ufeff\nNet interest expense decreased $1.1 million for the year ended August 31, 2019. Interest expense related to loans increased for the year ended August 31, 2019 due to increased use of more expensive short-term borrowing facilities. However, interest expense related to hedging activity decreased during the year ended August 31, 2019 due to the pay off of the various loans held by our subsidiaries that were hedged, and we capitalized more interest for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 because of higher levels of construction activities for the two clubs opened during the fiscal year and the two additional clubs to opened in the fall of calendar year 2019.\n\ufeff\nFinancial highlights for fiscal year 2019 included:\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n 1. The comparably favorable impact of 10.2% resulting from nonrecurrence of the U.S. Tax Reform Transition Tax. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Net income attributable to PriceSmart for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 was $20.7 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to $19.0 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. \nThe following table summarizes the shares repurchased during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nPolitical and other factors in each of our markets may have significant effects on our business. For example, labor strikes in Costa Rica disrupted normal commerce in September 2018. Social unrest in Honduras in May 2019 caused similar disruptions to commerce. U.S. foreign policy can also have an impact on social and economic stability in the countries where we operate. In 2018, U.S. legislation was approved to restrict U.S. aid to Nicaragua. Additionally, during 2019, the U.S. State Department has announced varying strategies regarding if, when and how it would authorize disbursement of foreign aid, that had been previously approved by the U.S. Congress, to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Changes in U.S. policies regarding financial assistance could cause political or financial instability in the countries we serve.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOther revenue for the year ended August 31, 2019 includes non-merchandise revenue generated by our marketplace and casillero operations primarily from freight and handlings charges for online orders placed from customers in Latin America to retailers in the United States and delivered to locations throughout Latin America from a business we acquired in March 2018. The $20.0 million increase in non-merchandise revenue compared to the prior year represents the inclusion of twelve months of non-merchandise revenue during fiscal year 2019 versus the inclusion of only five-and-a-half months of non-merchandise revenue during fiscal year 2018. For the year ended August 31, 2019, the net increase of $7.4 million in Miscellaneous income was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase mainly resulting from the adoption of the new revenue standard ASC 606, which results in interest generating portfolio ( IGP\u201d) income being included in Miscellaneous income. The remaining $2.9 million is a reimbursement we received during the second and third quarter of this fiscal year for underpayment of income earned on our co-branded credit card IGP.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 39.3%, as compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 of 31.7%. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\nNet merchandise sales in our Colombia segment experienced no material change for fiscal year 2019, when compared to fiscal year 2018. Net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment had no material impact on total net merchandise sales growth. The minimal growth for fiscal year 2019 is due to significant unfavorable foreign currency devaluation of the Colombian peso during the year.\nCurrency devaluations had an $11.0 million or 130 basis point (1.3%) negative constant currency impact on reported net merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment for the year ended August 31, 2019. The currency devaluations contributed approximately 40 basis points (0.4%) of the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales. This is reflective of the offsetting devaluation and appreciation of the mix of currencies within the markets in this segment when compared to the same period a year ago.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $46.1 million of certain acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses consist of warehouse club and other operations, general and administrative expenses, pre-opening expenses, and loss/(gain) on disposal of assets. In total, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $28.9 million to 12.8% of total revenues for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2019 compared to 12.1% for the same period during fiscal year 2018.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFor fiscal year 2018, we recorded net income associated with foreign currency transactions. During fiscal year 2018, we were able to mitigate losses associated with foreign currency transactions that were driven by the weakening of currencies within all of our major markets and high transaction costs associated with converting Trinidad dollars into available tradeable currencies such as Euros or Canadian dollars before converting them to U.S. dollars. We mitigated the higher transaction costs in Trinidad by adding additional costs into our pricing models in order to offset the higher transaction costs in Trinidad. As a result, we reported approximately $192,000 in net gains from foreign currency exchange for fiscal year 2018. For as long as the currency sourcing situation continues in Trinidad, we plan to maintain additional cost in our pricing model and will limit our shipments from the U.S. to Trinidad to levels that generally align with our Trinidad subsidiary's ability to pay for the merchandise in U.S. dollars.\nRepatriation of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries may require us to accrue and pay taxes. We have no plans at this time to repatriate cash through the payment of cash dividends by our foreign subsidiaries to our domestic operations and, therefore, have not accrued taxes that would be due from repatriation.\n\ufeff\nThe following table illustrates the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our comparable merchandise sales in dollars and the percentage change from the fifty-two week periods ended September 1, 2019.\nThe following table summarizes the selling, general and administrative expense for the periods disclosed.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIn the past, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar illiquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to settle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products, increasing our foreign exchange exposure to any devaluation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar. We continued to experience this situation in Trinidad ( TT\u201d) during fiscal year 2019. We are working with our banks in Trinidad to source tradeable currencies (including Euros, British Pounds, and Canadian dollars), but until the central bank in Trinidad makes more U.S. dollars available, this illiquidity condition is likely to continue. As of August 31, 2019, our Trinidad subsidiary had a net Trinidad dollar denominated asset position measured in USD of approximately $24.9 million, a decrease of $15.4 million from August 31, 2018 when our Trinidad subsidiary had net Trinidad dollar denominated asset position of approximately $40.3 million. We are carefully monitoring the situation, which may require us to limit future shipments from the U.S. to Trinidad in line with our ability to exchange Trinidad dollars for tradeable currencies to manage our exposure to any potential devaluation.\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Net merchandise sales increased 4.9% over the comparable prior year period. We ended the year with 41 warehouse clubs compared to 39 warehouse clubs at the end of the fiscal year 2017. \nComparison of 2019 and 2018\nFinancial highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 included:\nOverall, the effects of currency devaluations within our markets had an approximate $14.1 million or 50 basis point (0.5%) negative constant currency impact on net merchandise sales for the year ended August 31, 2018.\nPre-opening expense increased $1.8 million or 0.1% of total revenues compared to the prior year period. This increase is attributable to costs incurred to open our 42nd and 43rd warehouse club and for the two remaining warehouse clubs expected to open this calendar year.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nNet Merchandise Sales by Category\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations had a $37.7 million or 980 basis point (9.8%) negative constant currency impact on net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment for the year ended August 31, 2019. The currency devaluations contributed approximately 120 basis points (1.2%) to the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales.\n \u00b7 Membership income for the fiscal year 2019 increased 2.6% to $52.1 million primarily due to new member sign-ups for the club openings in Panama and the Dominican Republic. \n\ufeff\nThis annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements concerning PriceSmart, Inc.'s (\"PriceSmart\", the \"Company\" or \"we\") anticipated future revenues and earnings, adequacy of future cash flows, proposed warehouse club openings, the Company's performance relative to competitors and related matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements containing the words expect,\u201d believe,\u201d will,\u201d may,\u201d should,\u201d project,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipated,\u201d scheduled,\u201d and like expressions, and the negative thereof. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including, but not limited to the risks detailed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In addition, these risks are not the only risks that the Company faces. The Company could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating globally and in the U.S., as well as other risks that are not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial.\n\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\nOperating income for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019, decreased to $115.2 million (3.6% of total revenue) compared to $126.1 million (4.0% of total revenue) for the same period last year. As described above, lower merchandise margins as a percent of sales, higher expenses year-on-year related to investments to expand our omni-channel capabilities and the inclusion for the full twelve months ended August 31, 2019 of the net operating results from our marketplace and casillero business acquired in March 2018 were the primary factors for the decrease in operating income.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes the cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, held by our foreign subsidiaries and domestically (in thousands).\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 and 2017 in Constant Currency\n\ufeff\nOur Caribbean segment net merchandise sales increased 6.2% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, driven by sales increases within all of our markets in the segment, with the exception of our Barbados market. The difficult economic environment that affected fiscal year 2017 has improved, though we continue to closely monitor shipments of U.S. goods into our Trinidad market, as a result of continued currency illiquidity in that market. Trinidad net merchandise sales for fiscal year 2018 increased 2.2% when compared to the same period last year. The Company is not currently limiting shipments to Trinidad, but illiquidity concerns remain, which may again cause us to restrict shipments in the future.\nShares of common stock repurchased by us are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in the reduction of stockholders' equity in our consolidated balance sheets. We may reissue these treasury shares.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in financing activities total $32.0 million and $27.8 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash flows provided or used for financing activities are used primarily to fund our working capital needs and our warehouse club expansions and investments. The $4.2 million increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily the result of a net decrease of proceeds from long-term borrowings of $9.4 million compared to a year ago as we did not have any additional long-term borrowings in fiscal year 2019. Additionally, the amount of cash we used to repurchase shares of restricted stock upon vesting to cover employees' tax withholding obligations increased $1.4 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily as a result of the acceleration of vesting as a component of severance for one of our officers. We received $7.5 million of proceeds from short-term borrowings to fund our working capital and capital investment needs, offsetting this $10.8 million of cash used.\nComparison of Fiscal Year 2019 to 2018 and Fiscal Year 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\nThe mix of sales by major category changed slightly by 1% for Fresh Foods and Hardlines between fiscal year 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\nFor the year, the negative economic conditions, foreign currency devaluation, and socio-political conditions within our Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and Nicaragua markets contributed approximately 100 basis points (1.0%) of the decrease, which was offset by a 30 basis point (0.3%) increase in Honduras and El Salvador. The Central America segment comparable merchandise sales for fiscal year 2019 were impacted by the opening of the Company's seventh warehouse club in Costa Rica in\n\n\ufeff\nMembership Income\nFinancial highlights for fiscal year 2018 included:\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Operating income for fiscal year 2019 was $115.2 million, a decrease of $10.9 million compared to fiscal year 2018. \nCurrency devaluations had a $7.7 million or 90 basis point (0.9%) negative constant currency impact on reported net merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment for the year ended August 31, 2018. The currency devaluations contributed approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) of the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales.\nCurrency fluctuations can be one of the largest variables affecting our overall sales and profit performance, as we have experienced in prior fiscal years, because many of our markets are susceptible to foreign currency exchange rate volatility. During fiscal year 2019, approximately 77.0% of our net merchandise sales were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Of those sales, 52.0% were comprised of sales of products we purchased in U.S. dollars.\n \u00b7 Merchandise gross profits (net merchandise sales less associated cost of goods sold) increased 4.9% over the same prior year period, and merchandise gross profits as a percent of net merchandise sales were 14.5% which is unchanged from fiscal year 2017. \nCurrency devaluations within our Central America segment accounted for approximately 160 basis points (1.6%) of the impact of currency devaluations on total comparable merchandise sales for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. Our Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua markets all experienced currency devaluation when compared to the same period last year.\n\ufeff\nMembership income is recognized ratably over the one-year life of the membership. The increase in membership income primarily reflects a growth in membership accounts.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFor fiscal year 2018, the effective tax rate was 39.3%. The increase in the effective rate versus the prior year was primarily attributable to the following factors:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have generally been sufficient to fund our operations and allow us to invest in activities that support long-term growth and pay dividends on our common stock. We evaluate our funding requirements on a regular basis and use long-term and short-term borrowings to cover any shortfall in our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our capital requirements. We may consider funding alternatives to provide additional liquidity when necessary.\n\ufeff\nThe mix of sales by major category remained unchanged between fiscal year 2019 and 2018.\nOther comprehensive income/(loss) for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 resulted primarily from foreign currency translation adjustments related to the assets and liabilities and the translation of the statements of income related to revenue, costs and expenses of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. When the functional currency in our international subsidiaries is the local currency and not U.S. dollars, the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period. The corresponding translation gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. These adjustments will not affect net income until the sale or liquidation of the underlying investment. The reported other comprehensive income or loss reflects the unrealized increase or decrease in the value in U.S. dollars of the net assets of the subsidiaries as of the date of the balance sheet, which will vary from period to period as exchange rates fluctuate.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparable net merchandise sales for those warehouse clubs that were open for at least 13 \u00bd months for some or all of the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018 grew 2.3%.\nComparable net merchandise sales for those warehouse clubs that were open for at least 13 \u00bd months for some or all of the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019 decreased 0.6%.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFor fiscal year 2019, the effective tax rate was 33.8%. The decrease in the effective rate versus the prior year was primarily attributable to the following factors:\nOperating income for fiscal year 2018 was $126.1 million (4.0% of total revenue) compared to $136.2 million (4.5% of total revenue) for the same period last year. Within our Central America segment, higher expenses related to the addition of a new warehouse club coupled with lower sales volumes within our Panama and Nicaragua markets accounted for forty basis points (0.4%) of the decrease in operating income to total revenues. Additionally, the increase of approximately $16.1 million in total selling, general and administrative costs due to the additional costs of our Aeropost subsidiary, which are recorded within our U.S. segment, were the primary drivers of our decreased operating income by an additional thirty basis points (0.3%). These decreases were partially offset by an increase of operating income within our Colombia segment of 0.2% of total revenue, primarily due to increases in sales from the continued improved economic conditions in Colombia.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n \u00b7 Net merchandise sales increased 1.2% over the comparable prior year period. We ended the year with 43 warehouse clubs compared to 41 warehouse clubs at the end of the fiscal year 2018. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by 3.2%. \n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations within our Colombia segment accounted for approximately 130 basis points (1.3%) of the impact of currency devaluations on total comparable merchandise sales for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. This reflects the devaluation of the Colombia peso when compared to the same period a year ago.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCurrency appreciation had a $7.6 million or 20 basis point (0.2%) positive constant currency impact on net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment for the year ended August 31, 2018. The currency appreciations contributed approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) to the total negative impact on total net merchandise sales.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n \u00b7 Currency exchange transactions in the current year resulted in a $1.5 million net currency loss compared to a $192,000 net gain from currency exchange transactions last year primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Colombia. \n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\nIn 2017, we began evaluating options to replace our existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. We have deferred that decision in order to more holistically assess our overall IT landscape and strategy. Nevertheless, we continue to enhance our IT systems and infrastructure to respond to evolving business requirements in a manner we believe to be consistent with a future ERP migration process.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nAt the vesting dates for restricted stock awards to our employees, we repurchase a portion of the shares that have vested at the prior day's closing price per share, with the funds used to pay the employees' minimum statutory tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of restricted stock awards. We do not have a stock repurchase program.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOther Income (Expense), net\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nCurrent and Future Management Actions\nThe following discussion and analysis compares the results of operations for each of the three fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. Unless otherwise noted, all tables present U.S. dollar amounts in thousands. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Our operations consist of four reportable segments: Central America, the Caribbean, Colombia and the United States. The Company's reportable segments are based on management's organization of these locations into operating segments by general geographic location, which are used by management and the Company's chief operating decision maker in setting up management lines of responsibility, providing support services, and making operational decisions and assessments of financial performance. Segment amounts are presented after converting to U.S. dollars and consolidating eliminations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.\n \u00b7 Comparable net merchandise sales (that is, sales in the warehouse clubs that have been open for greater than 13 \u00bd calendar months) for the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2019 increased 1.5%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted comparable net merchandise sales negatively by 2.7%. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Total revenues increased 1.8% over the comparable prior year period. Net merchandise sales contributed 120 basis points (1.2%) of the increase and the remaining 60 basis points (0.6%) increase resulted from the inclusion of the full-year revenues from the marketplace and casillero operations that we acquired in March 2018. \nNet Merchandise Sales\nan area called Santa Ana. Often times, new warehouse clubs that we open are not far from existing warehouse clubs that are included in the calculation for comparable net merchandise sales, resulting in a transfer of some sales from an existing club (in this case Escazu) to the new club. This transfer of sales from existing warehouse clubs that are included in the calculation of comparable net merchandise sales to new warehouse clubs that are not included in the calculation can have an adverse impact on reported comparable net merchandise sales. We estimate that the transfer of sales associated with the Santa Ana opening negatively impacted the comparable net merchandise sales for the Central America segment by 50 basis points (0.5%). New warehouse clubs attract new members from areas not previously served by us and also create the opportunity for some existing members, particularly those who now find the new clubs closer to their homes, to shop more frequently.\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Net income attributable to PriceSmart for fiscal year 2018 was $74.3 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, compared to $90.7 million, or $2.98 per diluted share, in the prior year. \n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations within our Colombia segment accounted for approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) of positive impact of currency appreciation on total comparable merchandise sales for the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018. This reflects the appreciation of the Colombia peso when compared to the same period a year ago.\n \u00b7 Membership income for the fiscal year 2018 increased 6.4% to $50.8 million. \n\ufeff\n 2. The comparably favorable net impact of 2.4%, resulting from the U.S. Tax Reform current rate reduction which favorably impacted our effective tax rate by 2.6%, partially offset by an unfavorable re-measurement of net deferred tax assets/liabilities of 0.2%. \nWe are investing in digital transformation, including omni-channel capabilities that enable e-commerce, by integrating technology, talent, supply chain and operations to enhance the membership shopping experience, drive efficiencies and fuel sales growth. Our focus will be on launching these omni-channel capabilities in a methodical phased manner.\n \u00b7 Currency exchange transactions in the current year resulted in a $192,000 net currency gain compared to a $1.2 million net gain from currency exchange transactions in the prior year. \n\ufeff\nAdditionally, during fiscal year 2018, we began to expand our Platinum membership program. We began offering Platinum memberships in Costa Rica during fiscal year 2013 and added Panama, Dominican Republic and Trinidad during fiscal year 2018. We began offering Platinum memberships in the United States Virgin Island in October 2018 (fiscal year 2019).\nGeneral Market Factors\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nA devaluation of local currency reduces the value of sales and membership income that is generated in that country when translated to U.S. dollars for our consolidated results. In addition, when local currency experiences devaluation, we may elect to increase the local currency price of imported merchandise to maintain our target margins, which could impact demand for the merchandise affected by the price increase. We may also modify the mix of imported versus local merchandise and/or the source of imported merchandise to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations. Information about the effect of local currency devaluations is discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Net Merchandise Sales and Comparable Sales.\u201d\n\ufeff\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on its financial condition or consolidated financial statements.\nShort-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt\nOur sales and profits vary from market to market depending on general economic factors, including GDP growth; consumer preferences; foreign currency exchange rates; political policies and social conditions; local demographic characteristics (such as population growth); the number of years we have operated in a particular market; and the level of retail and wholesale competition in that market.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nGross margin on merchandise sales as a percentage of total revenue remained unchanged at 14.5% for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018 compared to the twelve month period ended August 31, 2017. Total gross margin to total revenues increased to 16.1% from 15.9% for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, mainly due to higher margins on nonmerchandise revenues of our Aeropost subsidiary, which increased the gross margin on total revenues, by approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) for the year. Membership income, rental income and miscellaneous income gross margin remained unchanged\nSeasonality\n\ufeff\nThe following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nFor the twelve-month period ended August 31, 2019, we had a net expense associated with foreign currency transactions of approximately $1.5 million, of which our Jamaica and Dominican Republic markets contributed $687,000 and $519,000, respectively. The main drivers for the year-to-date period loss is attributable to significant increases in our average U.S. dollar asset position in Jamaica and our average U.S. dollar liability position in the Dominican Republic compared to a year ago. We increased these positions to provide capital resources for our current and future warehouse club construction activities and other investments. In Jamaica our average U.S. dollar asset position was $19.8 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to $16.6 million in fiscal year 2018, or a 19% increase year-over-year. In the Dominican Republic our average U.S. dollar liability position was $26.6 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to $8.0 million in fiscal year 2018, or a 235% increase year-over-year.\nWe accrue an amount for our estimate of probable additional income tax liability. In certain cases, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has 50% or less likelihood of being sustained. This requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. There were no material changes in our uncertain income tax positions for the periods ended on August 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\ufeff\n\n \u00b7 Short-term VAT and Income tax receivables, recorded as Other current assets: This classification is used for any countries where our subsidiary has generally demonstrated the ability to recover the VAT or income tax receivable within one year. We also classify as short-term any approved refunds or credit notes to the extent that we expect to receive the refund or use the credit notes within one year. \n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations within our Central America segment accounted for approximately 40 basis points (0.4%) of the impact of currency devaluations on total comparable merchandise sales for the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018. Our Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras markets all experienced currency devaluation when compared to the same period last year.\n \u00b7 Merchandise gross profits (net merchandise sales less associated cost of goods sold) decreased 0.2% over the same prior year period, and merchandise gross profits as a percent of net merchandise sales were 14.3%, a decrease of 20 basis points (0.2%) from the same period last year. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparable Merchandise Sales\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Some of our accounting policies require management to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to business acquisitions, contingencies and litigation, income taxes, value added taxes, and long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Using different estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n 1. The comparably unfavorable impact of 10.2% resulting from the U.S. Tax Reform Transition Tax in fiscal year 2018. \nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates\u201d refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activities translated using the current period's currency exchange rates, and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand our underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the largest translation adjustments were related to the translation of the Colombia, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua subsidiaries' balance sheets and statements of income that required us to record additional losses, when compared to the prior year, to comprehensive net income on translation of approximately $19.4 million. Additionally, there was a comprehensive loss of approximately $3.3 million related to unrealized losses on changes in derivative obligations due to declining benchmark interest rates.\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017 in Constant Currency\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations within our Caribbean segment accounted for approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) of the impact of currency devaluations on total comparable merchandise for the fifty-two week period ended September 2, 2018. This is reflective of the offsetting devaluation and appreciation of the mix of currencies within the markets in this segment when compared to the same period a year ago.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNet interest expense reflects borrowings by PriceSmart, Inc. and our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries to finance new land acquisition and construction for new warehouse clubs, warehouse club expansions and distribution centers, the capital requirements of warehouse club and other operations and ongoing working capital requirements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of warehouse club and other operations, general and administrative expenses, pre-opening expenses, asset impairment and loss/(gain) on disposal of assets. In total, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $43.5 million to 12.1% of total revenues, an increase of 70 basis points (0.7%) compared to 11.4% of total revenues in fiscal year 2017. Warehouse club and other operations contributed 20 basis points (0.2%) of this increase. This was mainly due to approximately $6.4 million (0.2% of total revenues) in additional other operational costs associated with our Aeropost subsidiary during fiscal year 2018. General and administrative expenses contributed the remaining 50 basis points (0.5%) of the year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue, with $9.7 million in general and administrative costs associated with Aeropost contributing 30 basis points (0.3%) of this increase. The $9.7 million was composed of $1.1 million in amortization of technology intangibles, $1.4 million in amortization of post-combination compensation costs, and $7.2 million of other general and administrative costs. We also recorded in general and administrative expense during fiscal year 2018 $669,000 in acquisition costs, including legal, accounting and technical consulting related to the acquisition of Aeropost. Additionally, general and administrative expenses also grew as a percentage to total revenues due to increased staffing in our buying department and increased information technology costs. Asset impairment charges for approximately $1.4 million, net of tax benefit, were related to the write-off of costs for a software platform\n \u00b7 We recorded a $454,000 net currency gain from currency transactions in the current quarter compared to a $211,000 net currency gain in the same period last year, primarily due to a favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation in Jamaica. \n \u00b7 Operating income for fiscal year 2018 was $126.1 million, a decrease of $10.2 million compared to fiscal year 2017. \n \u00b7 the asset's inability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; \n\ufeff\nOverall, the effects of currency devaluations within our markets had an approximate $97.3 million or 320 basis point (3.2%) negative constant currency impact on net merchandise sales for the year ended August 31, 2019.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:\nTotal gross margin to total revenues increased 30 basis points (0.3%) for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019. The year to date increase is due to six and a half months of additional revenue of our marketplace and casillero business compared to the prior year, which increased the gross margin to total revenues ratio by approximately 30 basis points (0.3%). Membership income, rental income and miscellaneous income gross margin percentage remained unchanged. The reclassification of income generated from the IGP as a result of the implementation of new revenue recognition standards along with a refund payment from a credit card vendor increased total gross margins by approximately 20 basis points (0.2%) for the year to date period. This 50 basis point (0.5%) increase was offset by a net merchandise sales gross margin decline of 20 basis points (0.2%).\n\ufeff\n 3. The comparably unfavorable impact of 1.0% resulting from the effective tax rate impact of costs incurred to expand our omni-channel capabilities and the net operating results of our marketplace and casillero business. \n\ufeff\n\n\n\ufeff\n 5. The comparatively unfavorable impact on the effective tax rate of 0.9% resulting from a decrease in fiscal year 2019 in the magnitude of an intercompany transaction between PriceSmart, Inc. and our Colombian subsidiary in support of PriceSmart's ongoing market development and growth in Colombia compared to the prior year. The Company does not expect these intercompany transactions to continue in the future. \n (2) Warehouse club square feet at period end has been updated to reflect sales floor square feet vs. total building square feet to align with industry standards. \n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 and 2017\n\ufeff\nPlease refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 13 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for further discussion.\n \u00b7 significant changes in its strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and \nNet merchandise sales in our Caribbean segment grew 6.2% for fiscal year 2019, when compared to fiscal year 2018. This increase had a 170 basis point (1.7%) positive impact on total net merchandise sales growth. Our Jamaica and Dominican Republic markets led the way in this segment by having 11.5% and 11.6% growth, respectively. In the Dominican Republic, we launched our fifth club in June 2019, while Jamaica had exceptional comparable net merchandise sales growth of 11.6%. With the exception of our Barbados market, all other markets within this segment showed increased net merchandise sales year-on-year.\nTax Receivables\nFrom time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar illiquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to settle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products. Since fiscal year 2017, we have experienced this situation in Trinidad and have been unable to source a sufficient level of tradeable currencies in Trinidad. We are working with our banks in Trinidad to source tradeable currencies. We expect the illiquid market conditions in Trinidad to continue.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDemographic characteristics within each of our markets can also affect both the overall level of sales and also future sales growth opportunities. Island countries such as Aruba, Barbados and the U.S. Virgin Islands offer us limited upside for sales growth given their overall market size. Countries with a smaller upper and middle class consumer population, such as Honduras, El Salvador, Jamaica and Nicaragua, offer growth potential but they may have a more limited potential opportunity for sales growth as compared to more developed countries with larger upper and middle class consumer populations.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Total revenues increased 3.0% over the comparable prior year period. Net merchandise sales contributed 400 basis points (4.0%) to this increase; however, this increase was offset by a decrease in export sales, which contributed a 100 basis points (1.0%) decrease to total revenues. \nRepurchase of Equity Securities and Reissuance of Treasury Shares\nNet merchandise sales in our Central America segment increased 2.8% for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. General weakness in Panama, one of our largest markets in that segment, and social unrest starting in May 2018 within our Nicaragua market, resulted in negative combined growth within those two countries of 0.7% when compared to the prior year. All other Central American markets recorded positive growth in warehouse sales for the twelve-month period, with Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador together recording sales growth of greater than 3.5%.\nOur policy for classification and presentation of VAT receivables, income tax receivables and other tax receivables is as follows:\nLong-lived Assets\nIn the Central America segment, we estimate that cannibalization from the opening of the Company's seventh warehouse club in Costa Rica negatively impacted the comparable net merchandise sales by 180 basis points (1.8%). New warehouse clubs attract new members from areas not previously served by us and also create the opportunity for some existing members, particularly those who now find the new clubs closer to their homes, to shop more frequently. Additionally, general weakness in Panama, one of our largest markets in this segment, and social unrest starting in May 2018 within our Nicaragua market impacted comparable net merchandise sales by approximately 70 basis points (0.7%).\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $170.3 million and $119.5 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net merchandise sales and membership fees. Cash flows used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs (including payroll, employee benefits and utilities), as well as payments for income taxes. The $50.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase of accounts payable of $25.3 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to a decrease in accounts payable of $16.5 million in fiscal year 2018, which resulted in a $41.8 million change year-over-year. In addition, the net increase in other current and non-current assets and liabilities resulted in a $16.1 million change year-over-year. The accounts payable increase resulted from several factors, including a shift in the timing of inventory purchases in anticipation of the holiday season versus a year ago and working capital efficiency improvements. The other current and non-current assets and liabilities decrease is primarily the result of increases in salary and benefit accruals, deferred income, and other accruals due to the opening of two new clubs, which added additional headcount and membership income.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. \n\ufeff\nCurrency devaluations within our Caribbean segment accounted for approximately 30 basis points (0.3%) of the impact of currency devaluations on total comparable merchandise for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. Our Dominican Republic and Jamaica markets experienced currency devaluation when compared to the same period last year.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Membership income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 increased 4.2% to $13.4 million primarily due to new member sign-ups for the club openings in Panama and the Dominican Republic. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2019 to 2018\n\n\ufeff\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\n\n (1) The reconciling items reflect the amount eliminated on consolidation of intersegment transactions. \nOn a consolidated basis, net merchandise sales gross margin for fiscal year 2019 as a percentage of total net merchandise sales were 14.3%, 20 basis points (0.2%) lower than fiscal year 2018. Net merchandise margins decreased across all segments with the Central America segment contributing 10 basis points (0.1%), the Caribbean segment contributing 10 basis points (0.1%), and the Colombia segment contributed an immaterial amount to the overall decline. The 20 basis point (0.2%) decline compared to the prior year is a 30 basis point (0.3%) improvement from the nine-month period end May 31, 2019 when the year over year decline was 50 basis points (0.5%).\nComparable net merchandise sales in our Colombia segment decreased 0.3% for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019. The decrease had an immaterial negative impact in total comparable sales. The decline was largely due to the significantly unfavorable devaluation of the Colombia peso relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, one or more markets in which we operate may experience economic slowdowns, which can negatively impact our business. Most countries in our Central America segment experienced general market conditions that resulted in a difficult operating environment during fiscal year 2019. Increasing foreign currency exchange volatility, slowing global economy activity and trade, decreasing levels of public investment and tax reform stalled economic growth for most of our countries in this region. Our Colombia segment, in particular, experienced significant foreign currency exchange volatility during fiscal year 2019, which negatively affected reported sales growth for that segment.\n\ufeff\n\n 4. The comparably favorable impact of 1.3% resulting from the reversal of valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets in the Company's Colombia subsidiary, due to the ongoing improvement in our business in Colombia. \n (1) Our marketplace and casillero business was acquired in March 2018. This impact represents five and a half months of activity versus the entire twelve months of activity in the current year. \nDuring fiscal year 2018, the largest translation adjustments were related to the translation of the Colombia, Dominican Republic and Jamaica subsidiaries' balance sheets and statements of income that required us to record additional losses, when compared to the prior year, to comprehensive net income on translation of approximately $8.5 million.\nThe following table indicates the comparable net merchandise sales in the reportable segments in which we operate and the percentage growth in net merchandise sales by segment during fiscal years 2019 and 2018.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n 4. The comparatively unfavorable impact on the effective tax rate of 1.0% resulting from a decrease in fiscal year 2018 in the magnitude of an intercompany transaction between PriceSmart, Inc. and our Colombian subsidiary in support of PriceSmart's ongoing market development and growth in Colombia compared to the prior year. The intercompany transaction reduces taxable income in the U.S. and increases taxable income in our Colombia subsidiary where the additional taxable income is fully offset by the reversal of valuation allowances on accumulated net losses in that subsidiary. We expect the decrease of the favorable impact to the consolidated Company's effective tax rate to continue into fiscal year 2019. \n{\n\ufeff\nMission and Business Strategy\nthat was under development prior to the acquisition of Aeropost, because of Aeropost's Information Technology ( IT\u201d) platform and IT development capability.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\ufeff\nTotal revenue increased 5.7% from the twelve months ended August 31, 2017 to the same period ended August 31, 2018, year on year increases to net merchandise sales contributed 480 basis points (4.8%), non-merchandise revenue from Aeropost contributed 60 basis points (0.6%), increased export sales contributed 20 basis points (0.2%) and increased membership income contributed ten basis points (0.1%).\nOther Revenue\nManagement's judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation and can include management's best estimate of future business activity, which in turn drives estimates of future cash flows from these assets. These periodic evaluations could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value. Future business conditions and/or activity could differ materially from the projections made by management causing the need for additional impairment charges. No impairment charges have been recorded during fiscal year 2019 related to the loss of legal ownership or title to assets; significant changes in the Company's strategic business objectives or utilization of assets; or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. Loss/(gain) on disposal of assets recorded during the years reported resulted from improvements to operations and normal preventive maintenance.\n\ufeff\nThe following table indicates the impact that currency exchange rates had on our net merchandise sales in dollars and the percentage change from the year ended August 31, 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur Colombia segment's net merchandise sales increased 13.1% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. With the stabilization of the exchange rate between the Colombian peso and the U.S. dollar over the past two years, we have seen an improving sales picture in all of our warehouse clubs in Colombia. This, coupled with our efforts to source high quality merchandise from local suppliers, resulted in an 8.9% increase in transactions in the fiscal year and average ticket growth of 3.9%.\n\ufeff\nOverall net merchandise sales grew by 1.2% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, resulting from a 2.9% increase in transactions offset by a 1.7% decrease in average ticket. In addition, we had 43 clubs in operation as of August 31, 2019 compared to 41 clubs as of August 31, 2018.\nWe reissued 63,000 treasury shares as part of our stock-based compensation programs during fiscal year 2019, but we did not reissue any treasury shares during fiscal years 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther revenue primarily consists of non-merchandise revenue from freight and handling fees generated from our marketplace and casillero operations, interest-generating portfolio from our co-branded credit cards, and rental income from operating leases where the Company is the lessor.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe report comparable net merchandise sales on a same week\u201d basis with 13 weeks in each quarter beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday. The periods are established at the beginning of the fiscal year to provide as close a match as possible to the calendar month and quarter that is used for financial reporting purposes. This approach equalizes the number of weekend days and weekdays in each period for improved sales comparison, as we experience higher merchandise club sales on the weekends. Each of the warehouse clubs used in the calculations was open for at least 13 \u00bd calendar months before its results for the current period were compared with its results for the prior period. For example, sales related to our warehouse club in Panama opened on May 1, 2019 will not be used in the calculation of comparable sales until July 2020, and the sales related to our warehouse club opened in the Dominican Republic on June 27, 2019 will not be used in the calculation of comparable sales until September 2020. Therefore, comparable net merchandise sales includes 41 warehouse clubs for the fifty-two week period ended September 1, 2019.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>
