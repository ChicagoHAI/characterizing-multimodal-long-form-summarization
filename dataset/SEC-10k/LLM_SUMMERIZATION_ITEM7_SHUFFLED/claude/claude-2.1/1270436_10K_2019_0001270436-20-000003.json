MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n\ufeff\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including fair value of financial instruments. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\ufeff\nAll amounts in this disclosure are in thousands (except share, unit, per share, and per unit data) except where otherwise noted.\n\ufeff\nName Change; Common Stock Reverse Stock Split\n\ufeff\nOn September 1, 2017, we filed two Articles of Amendment to our charter with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, pursuant to which we (i) changed our name to Cohen & Company Inc.\u201d; (ii) effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (iii) increased the par value of our Common Stock from $0.001 per share to $0.01 per share. All share and per share amounts for all periods presented herein reflect the reverse split as if it had occurred as of the beginning of the first period presented.\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nWe are a financial services company specializing in fixed income markets. We were founded in 1999 as an investment firm focused on small-cap banking institutions but have grown to provide an expanding range of capital markets and asset management services. We are organized into three business segments: Capital Markets, Asset Management, and Principal Investing.\n\ufeff\nTable 153: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapital Markets: Our Capital Markets business segment consists primarily of fixed income sales, trading, matched book repo financing, new issue placements in corporate and securitized products, and advisory services. Our fixed income sales and trading group provides trade execution to corporate investors, institutional investors, mortgage originators, and other smaller broker-dealers. We specialize in a variety of products, including but not limited to: corporate bonds, ABS, MBS, RMBS, CDOs, CLOs, CBOs, CMOs, municipal securities, TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts, SBA loans, U.S. government bonds, U.S. government agency securities, brokered deposits and CDs for small banks, and hybrid capital of financial institutions including TruPS, whole loans, and other structured financial instruments. We also offer execution and brokerage services for equity products. We carry out our capital markets activities primarily through our subsidiaries: JVB in the U.S. and CCFL and CCFEL in Europe.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAsset Management: Our Asset Management business segment manages assets within CDOs, managed accounts, joint ventures, and investment funds (collectively, Investment Vehicles\u201d). A CDO is a form of secured borrowing. The borrowing is secured by different types of fixed income assets such as corporate or mortgage loans or bonds. The borrowing is in the form of a securitization, which means that the lenders are actually investing in notes backed by the assets. In the event of default, the lenders will have recourse only to the assets securing the loan. Our Asset Management business segment includes our fee-based asset management operations, which include on-going base and incentive management fees. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2.76 billion in AUM of which 79.7%, or $2.20 billion, was in CDOs. A substantial portion of our asset management revenue is earned from the management of CDOs. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations. The remaining portion of our AUM is from a diversified mix of other Investment Vehicles that were more recently formed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPrincipal Investing: Our Principal Investing business segment is comprised of investments that we have made for the purpose of earning an investment return rather than investments made to support our trading, matched book repo, or other Capital Markets business segment activities. These investments are a component of our other investments, at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nWe generate our revenue by business segment primarily through the following activities.\n\ufeff\nCapital Markets:\n\ufeff\nTable 156: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOur trading activities, which include execution and brokerage services, securities lending activities, riskless trading activities, as well as gains and losses (unrealized and realized) and income and expense earned on securities classified as trading;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet interest income on our matched book repo financing activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNew issue and advisory revenue comprised of (a) new issue revenue associated with originating, arranging, or placing newly created financial instruments; and (b) revenue from advisory services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nAsset Management:\n\ufeff\nTable 159: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAsset management fees for our on-going asset management services provided to certain Investment Vehicles, which may include fees both senior and subordinate to the securities issued by the Investment Vehicle; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncentive management fees earned based on the performance of the certain Investment Vehicles.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nPrincipal Investing:\n\ufeff\nTable 161: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGains and losses (unrealized and realized) and income and expense earned on securities classified as other investments, at fair value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nBusiness Environment\nOur business in general and our Capital Markets business segment in particular, do not produce predictable earnings. Our results can vary dramatically from year to year and quarter to quarter.\nOur business is materially affected by economic conditions in the financial markets, political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, the housing and mortgage markets, changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions, and changes in interest rates, including overnight funding rates, all of which can affect our profitability and are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors and companies, including their level of participation in the financial markets and their willingness to participate in corporate transactions. Severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce our trading volume and revenues, negatively affect our ability to generate new issue and advisory revenue, and adversely affect our profitability.\nAs a general rule, our trading business benefits from increased market volatility. Increased volatility usually results in increased activity from our clients and counterparties. However, periods of extreme volatility may at times result in clients reducing their trading volumes, which would negatively impact our results. Also, periods of extreme volatility may result in large fluctuations in securities valuations and we may incur losses on our holdings. Also, our mortgage group's business benefits when mortgage volumes increase, and may suffer when mortgage volumes decrease. Among other things, mortgage volumes are significantly impacted by changes in interest rates.\nIn addition, as a smaller firm, we are exposed to intense competition. Although we provide financing to our customers, larger firms have a much greater capability to provide their clients with financing, giving them a competitive advantage. We are much more reliant upon our employees' relationships, networks, and abilities to identify and capitalize on market opportunities. Therefore, our business may be significantly impacted by the addition or loss of key personnel.\nWe try to address these challenges by (i) focusing our business on clients and asset classes that are underserved by the large firms, (ii) continuing to monitor our fixed costs to enhance operating leverage and limit our losses during periods of low volumes, and (iii) attempting to hire and retain entrepreneurial and effective traders and salespeople.\nOur business environment is rapidly changing. New risks and uncertainties emerge continuously and it is not possible for us to predict all the risks we will face. This may negatively impact our operating performance.\nA portion of our revenue is generated from net trading activity. We engage in proprietary trading for our own account, provide securities financing for our customers, and execute riskless\u201d trades with a customer order in hand resulting in limited market risk to us. The inventory of securities held for our own account, as well as held to facilitate customer trades, and our market making activities are sensitive to market movements.\nA portion of our revenue is generated from new issue and advisory engagements. The fees charged and volume of these engagements are sensitive to the overall business environment. We provide investment banking and advisory services in Europe primarily through our subsidiary CCFEL and new issue services in the U.S. through our subsidiary JVB. Currently, our primary source of new issue revenue is from originating assets for our U.S. insurance asset management business and the PriDe funds and managed accounts.\nA portion of our revenue is generated from management fees. Our ability to charge management fees and the amount of those fees is dependent upon the underlying investment performance and stability of the Investment Vehicles. If these types of investments do not provide attractive returns to investors, the demand for such instruments will likely fall, thereby reducing our opportunity to earn\nnew management fees or maintain existing management fees. As of December 31, 2019, 79.7% of our existing AUM were CDOs. The creation of CDOs has depended upon a vibrant securitization market. Since 2008, volumes within the securitization market have dropped significantly and have not fully recovered since that time. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. The remaining portion of our AUM is from a diversified mix of other Investment Vehicles most of which were more recently formed.\nA substantial portion of our asset management revenue is earned from the management of CDOs. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations.\nA portion of our revenues is generated from our principal investing activities. Therefore, our revenues are impacted by the overall market supply and demand of these investments as well as the individual performance of each investment. Our principal investments are included within other investments, at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMargin Pressures in Fixed Income Brokerage Business\nPerformance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of the economy and financial market activity. Overall market conditions are a product of many factors beyond our control and can be unpredictable. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors including the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets, the level and shape of the various yield curves, and the volume and value of trading in securities.\nMargins and volumes in certain products and markets within the fixed income brokerage business continue to decrease materially as competition has increased and general market activity has declined. Further, we continue to expect that competition will increase over time, resulting in continued margin pressure.\n\ufeff\nOur response to this margin compression has included: (i) building a diversified fixed income trading platform; (ii) acquiring or building out new product lines and expanding existing product lines; (iii) building a hedging execution and funding operation to service mortgage originators; (iv) becoming a full netting member of the FICC enabling us to expand our matched book repo business, and (v) monitoring our fixed costs. Our cost management initiatives are ongoing. However, there can be no certainty that these efforts will be sufficient. If insufficient, we will likely see a decline in profitability.\nU.S. Housing Market\nIn recent years, our mortgage group has grown in significance to our Capital Markets segment and our company overall. The mortgage group primarily earns revenue by providing hedging execution, securities financing, and trade execution services to mortgage originators and other investors in mortgage backed securities. Therefore, this group's revenue is highly dependent on the volume of mortgage originations in the U.S. Origination activity is highly sensitive to interest rates, the U.S. job market, housing starts, sale activity of existing housing stock, as well as the general health of the U.S. economy. In addition, any new regulation that impacts U.S. government agency mortgage backed security issuance activity, residential mortgage underwriting standards, or otherwise impacts mortgage originators will impact our business. We have no control over these external factors and there is no effective way for us to hedge against these risks. Our mortgage group's volumes and profitability will be highly impacted by these external factors.\nOther Business and Transactions\n\ufeff\nThe 2019 Senior Notes\nOn September 25, 2019, we amended and restated the previously outstanding 2013 Convertible Notes that were scheduled to mature on September 25, 2019. The material terms and conditions of the 2013 Convertible Notes remained substantially the same, except that (i) the maturity date thereof changed from September 25, 2019 to September 25, 2020; (ii) the conversion feature in the 2013 Convertible Notes was removed; (iii) the interest rate thereunder changed from 8% per annum (9% in the event of certain events of default) to 12% per annum (13% in the event of certain events of default); and (iv) the restrictions regarding prepayment were removed. The post amendment notes are referred to herein as the 2019 Senior Notes\u201d and the pre-amendment notes are referred to herein as the 2013 Convertible Notes.\u201d See note 33 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the issuance of the 2020 Senior Notes and partial repayment of the 2019 Senior Notes.\nAmendments to 2013 Convertible Notes\n\ufeff\nThe original maturity date of the 2013 Convertible Notes was September 25, 2018. Immediately prior to maturity, the 2013 Convertible Notes were held by three parties. On September 25, 2018, we fully paid off one holder in the amount of $1,461. We entered into amendments with the holders of the remaining $6,786 aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Convertible Notes: the Edward E. Cohen IRA and the EBC 2013 Family Trust. Edward E. Cohen is the benefactor of the Edward E. Cohen IRA and is the father of Daniel G. Cohen, the chairman of our board of directors and the president and chief executive of our European operations and chairman of our board of directors. Daniel G. Cohen is a trustee of the EBC 2013 Family Trust. Pursuant to the amendments, (i) the maturity date of each of the 2013 Convertible Notes was extended from September 25, 2018 to September 25, 2019 and (ii) the conversion price under each of the 2013 Convertible Notes was reduced from $30.00 per share of Common Stock to $12.00 per share of Common Stock. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nViaNova\nIn 2018, we formed a new subsidiary, ViaNova, for the purpose of building a RTL business. RTLs are small balance commercial loans secured by first lien mortgages used by professional investors and real estate developers to finance the purchase and rehabilitation of residential properties. ViaNova's business plan includes buying, aggregating, and distributing these loans to produce superior risk-adjusted returns through the pursuit of opportunities overlooked by commercial banks. To that end, we have hired four professionals and entered into a line of credit with LegacyTexas Bank. See notes 4, 19, and 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nU.S. Insurance JV\n\ufeff\nIn May 2018, we committed to invest up to $3,000 in a newly formed joint venture (the U.S. Insurance JV\u201d) with an outside investor that committed to invest approximately $63,000 of equity in the U.S. Insurance JV. The U.S. Insurance JV was formed for the purposes of investing in debt issued by small and medium sized U.S. and Bermuda insurance and reinsurance companies and is managed by Dekania Capital Management, LLC, a registered investment adviser subsidiary of the Company ( DCM\u201d). We are required to invest 4.5% of the total equity of the U.S. Insurance JV with an absolute limit of $3,000. The U.S. Insurance JV may use leverage to grow its assets. As of December 31, 2019, we had invested $2,642.\nThe insurance company debt that will be acquired by the U.S. Insurance JV may be originated by JVB and there may be origination fees earned in connection with such transactions. We also earn management fees as manager of the U.S. Insurance JV. We are entitled to a quarterly base management fee, an annual incentive fee (if certain return hurdles are met), and an additional incentive fee upon the liquidation of the portfolio (if certain return hurdles are met). See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nSPAC Funds\nIn August 2018, we invested in and became the general partner of a series of newly formed partnerships, the SPAC Funds, for the purposes of investing in the equity securities of SPACs. Cohen & Company Financial Management, LLC, a registered investment adviser subsidiary of the Company ( CCFM\u201d), is the manager of the SPAC Funds. As of December 31, 2019, we had invested $646 in the SPAC Funds. We are entitled to a quarterly base management fee based on a percentage of the net asset value of the SPAC Funds and an annual incentive allocation based on the actual returns earned by the SPAC Funds. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nInsurance Acquisition Corporation (the Insurance SPAC\u201d)\n\ufeff\nWe are the sponsor of the Insurance SPAC, a blank check company seeking to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses (each a Business Combination\u201d).\n\ufeff\nOn March 22, 2019, the Insurance SPAC completed the sale of 15,065,000 units (the SPAC Units\u201d) in its initial public offering (the IPO\u201d). Each SPAC Unit consists of one share of the SPAC's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ( SPAC Common Stock\u201d), and one-half of one warrant (each, a SPAC Warrant\u201d), where each whole SPAC Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The SPAC Units were sold in the IPO at an offering price of $10.00 per SPAC Unit, for gross proceeds of $150,650 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Pursuant to the underwriting agreement in the IPO, the Insurance SPAC granted the underwriters in the IPO (the Underwriters\u201d) a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,965,000 additional SPAC Units solely to cover over-allotments, if any (the Over-Allotment Option\u201d); and on March 22, 2019, the Underwriters exercised the Over-Allotment Option in full. Immediately following the completion of the IPO, there were an aggregate of 20,653,333 shares of SPAC Common Stock issued and outstanding.\nIf the Insurance SPAC fails to consummate a Business Combination within the first 18 months following the IPO, its corporate existence will cease except for the purposes of winding up its affairs and liquidating its assets.\nWe are the manager and a member of each of two entities: Insurance Acquisition Sponsor, LLC and Dioptra Advisors, LLC (together, the Sponsor Entities\u201d). The Sponsor Entities purchased 375,000 of the Insurance SPAC's placement units in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the IPO for an aggregate of $3,750, or $10.00 per placement unit. Each placement unit consists of one share of SPAC Common Stock and one-half of one warrant (the Placement Warrant\u201d). The placement units are identical to the SPAC Units sold in the IPO except (i) the shares of SPAC Common Stock issued as part of the placement units and the Placement Warrants will not be redeemable by the Insurance SPAC, (ii) the Placement Warrants may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis, (iii) the shares of SPAC Common Stock issued as part of the placement units, together with the Placement Warrants, are entitled to certain registration rights, and (iv) for so long as they are held by the Underwriter, the placement units will not be exercisable more than five years following the effective date of the registration statement filed by the Insurance SPAC in connection with the IPO. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the placement units (including the underlying Placement Warrants and SPAC Common Stock and the shares of SPAC Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Placement Warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We have agreed to lend the Insurance SPAC $750 for operating and acquisition related expenses. No amounts have been lent to date under this facility.\n\ufeff\nThe Sponsor Entities raised $2,550 from third-party investors and the remaining investment in the private placement was made by the Company. The Company consolidates the Sponsor Entities and treats its investment in the Insurance SPAC as an equity method investment. The $2,550 raised from third-party investors is treated as non-controlling interest. See notes 4 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe proceeds from the placement units were added to the net proceeds from the IPO to be held in a trust account. If the Insurance SPAC does not complete a Business Combination within the first 18 months following the IPO, the proceeds from the sale of the placement units will be used to fund the redemption of the SPAC Common Stock sold as part of the SPAC Units in the IPO (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Placement Warrants will expire worthless.\nThe Sponsor Entities collectively hold 5,103,333 founder shares of the Insurance SPAC. Subject to certain limited exceptions, placement units held by the Sponsor Entities will not be transferable or salable until 30 days following a Business Combination, and founder shares held by the Sponsor Entities will not be transferable or salable except (a) with respect to 20% of such shares, until consummation of a Business Combination, and (b) with respect to additional 20% tranches of such shares, when the closing price of the SPAC common stock exceeds $12.00, $13.50, $15.00, and $17.00, respectively, for 20 out of any 30 consecutive trading days following the consummation of a Business Combination, in each case subject to certain limited exceptions.\n\ufeff\nCohen & Company Financial (Europe) Limited\n\ufeff\nIn June 2018, in response to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, we formed a new subsidiary, CCFEL in Ireland, for the purpose of seeking to become regulated to perform asset management and capital markets activities in Ireland and the European Union. In April 2019, CCFEL received authorization from the CBI under the European Union (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2017 to provide investment services in respect of certain financial instruments including transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and various option, futures, swaps, forward rate agreements and other derivative contracts ( Financial Instruments\u201d). The services for which CCFEL received authorization include the receipt and transmission of orders in relation to Financial Instruments, the execution of orders on behalf of clients, portfolio management, investment advice and investment research, and financial analysis. In addition, CCFEL applied for approval of a French branch, which approval was granted by the CBI and the branch was authorized by the French regulators in April 2019. Following authorization of the French Branch of CCFEL, various contracts originally entered into by CCFL were novated to the French Branch of CCFEL. The novation of contracts was completed on July 1, 2019.\n\ufeff\nInvestment in CK Capital Partners B.V. and AOI\n\ufeff\nIn December 2019, we acquired a 45% interest in CK Capital Partners B.V. ( CK Capital\u201d), a private company incorporated in the Netherlands. CK Capital provides asset and investment advisory services relating to real estate holdings. We purchased this interest for $18 (of which $17 was from an entity controlled by our chairman, Daniel G. Cohen.) In addition, we also acquired a 10% interest in Amersfoort Office Investment I Cooperatief U. A. ( AOI\u201d), a real estate holding company, for $1 and subsequently invested $558. The investments in AOI and CK Capital Partners are included in equity method investments on the consolidated balance sheets. See notes 4,12, and 31 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nSecurities Purchase Agreement - Purchase of IMXI shares\nOn December 30, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SPA\u201d) with Daniel G. Cohen and the DGC Trust. In connection with the SPA, we purchased an aggregate of 662,361 shares of International Money Express, Inc. ( IMXI\u201d), an\nunrelated publicly traded company, from Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust. Of the 662,361 shares, 134,317 shares were unrestricted and 528,044 are subject to sale restrictions. Of the 528,044 restricted shares, 246,021 shares become freely tradeable if IMXI's share price equals or exceeds $15.00 per share for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days or upon a change of control of IMXI, and 264,023 shares become freely tradeable if IMXI's share price equals or exceed $17.00 per share 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days or upon a change of control of IMXI. IMXI's share price closed at $11.89 per share on December 31, 2019. In exchange for the IMXI shares, the Operating LLC issued an aggregate of 22,429,273 newly issued units of membership interests in the Operating LLC to Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust. These membership interests represent an equity interest in the Operating LLC. Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, units of membership interests in the Operating LLC are redeemable and, if redeemed, Cohen & Company Inc. can determine to have the Operating LLC pay cash in exchange for the membership interests or Cohen & Company Inc. may instead issue additional Common Shares on a 1 for 10 basis in exchange for the membership interests. Therefore, the membership interests in the Operating LLC issued in connection with the SPA may be convertible into an aggregate of up to 2,242,927 Common Shares (subject to certain restrictions set forth in the SPA). We obtained a third-party valuation of the IMXI shares and determined the value of these shares upon closing of the SPA was $7,779. We recorded this transaction as an increase in other investments, at fair value of $7,779 and an increase in non-controlling interest of $7,779 in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the SPA, Cohen & Company Inc. issued an aggregate of 22,429,541 newly issued shares Series F Preferred Stock to Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust. Our Series F Preferred Stock have no economic rights and entitle the holders thereof to vote together with holders of our Common Stock on all matters presented to the such common stockholders, with each holder of Series F Preferred Stock being entitled to one vote for every ten preferred shares held (i.e., the Series F Preferred Stock issued in connection with the SPA entitle the holder to 2,242,927 votes). The Series F Preferred Stock do not participate in earnings or dividends.\nImmediately prior to the effectiveness of the SPA, Cohen & Company Inc. owned 67.8% of the outstanding units of membership interests of the Operating LLC. Immediately subsequent to the effectiveness of the SPA, Cohen & Company Inc. owned 28.75% of the outstanding units of membership interests of the Operating LLC. As part of the SPA, Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust agreed to grant to Cohen & Company Inc. a proxy to vote, at any meeting of the Operating LLC, the number of the units of membership interests owned by Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust so that Cohen & Company Inc. would have 51.00% of the total votes eligible to vote at such meeting (the SPA Proxy\u201d). The actual units of membership interests that are subject to this proxy are determined at any meeting of the Operating LLC that a vote is held as follows: First, the total number of units of membership interests entitled to vote is determined. Second, the total number of units of membership interests entitled to vote is multiplied by 51.00% and the total units of membership interests held by Cohen & Company Inc. is subtracted from this amount. The result represents the total number of units of membership interests owned by Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust which will be subject to the SPA Proxy and that Cohen & Company Inc. will be entitled to vote. The number of units of membership interests subject to the proxy is allocated between Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust on a pro rata allocation.\nTherefore, subsequent to the SPA and taking into account the SPA Proxy, Cohen & Company Inc. own 28.75% of the economic interests of the Operating LLC and controls 51.00% of the voting interests of the Operating LLC. Because Cohen & Company Inc. continues to maintain voting control of the Operating LLC, Cohen & Company Inc. will continue to consolidate the Operating LLC in its consolidated financial statements. However, earnings shall be allocated to Cohen & Company Inc. and the other members of the Operating LLC based on their respective economic interests. Accordingly, the non-controlling interest percentage reflected in the consolidated statement of operations will change from 32.22% immediately prior to the effectiveness of the SPA to 71.25% immediately subsequent to the effectiveness of the SPA.\nSee notes 21 and 31 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following section provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the specified periods. The period-to-period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\ufeff\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\ufeff\nThe

We earn revenue from a limited number of engagements. Therefore, a small change in the number of engagements can result in large fluctuations in the revenue recognized. Further, even if the number of engagements remains consistent, the average revenue per engagement can fluctuate considerably. Finally, our revenue is generally earned when an underlying transaction closes (rather than on a monthly or quarterly basis). Therefore, the timing of underlying transactions increases the volatility of our revenue recognition.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we often incur certain costs related to new issue engagements. These costs are included as a component of either subscriptions, clearing and execution, or professional fees and other and will generally be recognized in the same period that the related revenue is

As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations.

As a result of the successful auction, our deferred subordinated management fees were paid. As a result, we recorded revenue of $2,997 and related professional fees and other expense of $999 in 2018. The total revenue earned on this CDO was $3,211 and $304 for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We will no longer earn any revenue in the future from this securitization. Except as set forth above, asset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - U.S. declined as compared to 2017 because AUM declined primarily due to principal repayments on the assets of these securitizations.\n\ufeff\nIn 2018, asset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - Europe was impacted by the successful auction and liquidation of Dekania Europe 1. As a result of the successful auction, our deferred subordinated management fees were paid as well as other one-time fees associated with termination. The total revenue earned on this CDO was $434 and $592 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition to this decrease, we experienced a decline in revenues earned from the remaining CDOs primarily due to principal payments on the assets in these securitizations.\n\ufeff\nAsset management fees for broadly syndicated loans - Europe consist of a single CLO. Fees declined primarily due to a decline in subordinated asset management fees. During 2018, the performance of the portfolio deteriorated and certain cash flow diversion features of the CLO were triggered. As a result, cash flow that would otherwise pay subordinated management fees was diverted to pay principal on the senior securities. In addition, fees declined because of a reduction in AUM due to principal payments received.\n\ufeff\nOther\n\ufeff\nOther asset management revenue increased by $2,568 to $4,617 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $2,049 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to performance fees being earned on and increases in the AUM of our managed accounts during 2018.\n\ufeff\nNew Issue and Advisory Revenue\n\ufeff\nNew issue and advisory revenue decreased by $3,361, or 53%, to $2,979 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $6,340 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nOur new issue and advisory revenue has been, and we expect it will continue to be, volatile. We earn revenue from a limited number of engagements. Therefore, a small change in the number of engagements can result in large fluctuations in the revenue recognized. Further, even if the number of engagements remains consistent, the average revenue per engagement can fluctuate considerably. Finally, our revenue is generally earned when an underlying transaction closes (rather than on a monthly or quarterly basis). Therefore, the timing of underlying transactions increases the volatility of our revenue recognition.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we often incur certain costs related to new issue engagements. These costs are included as a component of either subscriptions, clearing and execution, or professional fees and other and will generally be recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized.\n\ufeff\nPrincipal Transactions and Other Income\n\ufeff\nPrincipal transactions and other income decreased by $1,823 to $4,573 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $6,396

This increase was comprised of an increase of $97 in business development and an increase in occupancy and equipment of $175.

This increase was comprised of increases in subscriptions of $457 and clearing and execution of $874. The subscriptions increase was primarily the result of increases in Bloomberg licensing charges and new subscriptions to support the ViaNova business.

This increase was comprised of an increase of $1,140 in professional fees; partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses of $26. Professional fees increased due to sub-advisory fees incurred in connection with the successful auction of the Alesco II CDO managed by DCM, as well as a finder's fee incurred in connection with new issue and advisory revenue earned by JVB for the origination of financial assets.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\ufeff\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $12, or 5%, to $261 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $249 for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The tax benefit recognized in 2018 was comprised of a current tax benefit of $4 and a deferred tax benefit of $837. The deferred tax benefit recognized in 2018 was the result of the net loss incurred by us in 2018. This net loss provided additional NOL carryforwards that can be recognized as a benefit to the extent such carryforwards can be scheduled against our deferred tax liability reversal. The tax benefit recognized in 2017 was comprised of $1,279 of deferred tax benefit, partially offset by $68 of current tax expense. The deferred tax benefit recognized in 2017 was primarily the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA\u201d). Among other things, the TCJA reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, we revalued our deferred tax liability and recognized a one-time tax deferred income tax benefit.\n\ufeff\nNet Income / (Loss) Attributable to the Non-controlling Interest\n\ufeff\nNet income / (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was comprised of the non-controlling interest related to member interests in the Operating LLC other than interests held by us for the relevant periods.

In addition, our U.S., European, and United Kingdom broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to certain regulatory requirements to maintain minimum levels of net capital. Historically, our primary sources of funds have been our operating activities and general corporate borrowings. In addition, our trading operations have generally been financed by the use of collateralized securities financing arrangements as well as margin loans. In recent years, we have engaged in a number of capital raising transactions with Daniel G. Cohen, Chairman of the Board and President and Chief Executive of European operations, and/or persons or entities controlled by or close to Mr. Cohen because the terms of such transactions have been more favorable than terms available from unrelated third parties. Our ability to fund losses or expand our business operations on favorable terms in the future may depend on our continued ability to raise capital from Mr. Cohen and/or such persons and entities.\n\ufeff\nCertain subsidiaries of the Operating LLC have restrictions on the withdrawal of capital and otherwise in making distributions and loans. JVB is subject to net capital restrictions imposed by the SEC and FINRA that require certain minimum levels of net capital to remain in this subsidiary. In addition, these restrictions could potentially impose notice requirements or limit our ability to withdraw capital above the required minimum amounts (excess capital) whether through a distribution or a loan. CCFL is regulated by the\nFinancial Conduct Authority ( FCA\u201d) and CCFEL is regulated by the CBI and both must maintain certain minimum levels of capital. See note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations below.\nDuring the third quarter of 2010, our board of directors initiated a dividend of $0.50 per quarter, which was paid regularly through December 31, 2011. Beginning in 2012, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per quarter, which was paid regularly through the first quarter of 2019. Each time a cash dividend was declared by our board of directors, a pro rata distribution was made to the other members of the Operating LLC upon payment of dividends to our stockholders.\n\ufeff\nOn August 2, 2019, our board of directors announced that we have decided to suspend our quarterly cash dividend. We currently intend to use the related annual cash savings to invest in new business initiatives and improve our financial position. Any future determination to declare and pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account a variety of factors, including business, financial, and regulatory considerations as well as any limitations under Maryland law or imposed by any agreements governing our indebtedness. Going forward, the board of directors will re-assess our capital resources and may or may not determine to reinstate the dividend based on that assessment.\nEach time a cash dividend was declared by our board of directors, a pro rata distribution was made to the other members of the Operating LLC upon payment of dividends to our stockholders.\n\ufeff\nSince March 17, 2016, we entered into two letter agreements (together, the 10b5-1 Plan\u201d) with Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. (the Agent\u201d). The most recent letter agreement provided for the Agent to purchase up to an aggregate maximum of $2,000 of Common Stock and was in effect until March 19, 2019. It expired on that date and we did not enter into a new letter agreement. Pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan, purchases of Common Stock may have been made in public and private transactions and were required to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act.

See note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, our licensed broker-dealers are generally subject to capital withdrawal notification and restrictions.\n\ufeff\nSecurities Financing\n\ufeff\nWe maintain repurchase agreements with various third-party financial institutions. There is no maximum limit as to the amount of securities that may be transferred pursuant to these agreements, and transactions are approved on a case-by-case basis. The repurchase agreements do not include substantive provisions other than those covenants and other customary provisions contained in standard master repurchase agreements. The repurchase agreements generally require us to transfer additional securities to the counterparty in the event the value of the securities then held by the counterparty in the margin account falls below specified levels and contain events of default were we to breach our obligations under the agreement. We receive margin calls from our repurchase agreement counterparties from time to time in the ordinary course of business. To date, we have maintained sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls, and we have never been unable to satisfy a margin call, however, no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy requests from our counterparties to post additional collateral in the future. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nIf there were an event of default under a repurchase agreement, the counterparty would have the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and make any amount due from us to the counterparty payable immediately. Repurchase obligations are full recourse obligations to us. If we were to default under a repurchase obligation, the counterparty would have recourse to our other assets if the collateral was not sufficient to satisfy our obligations in full. Most of our repurchase agreements are entered into as part of our matched book repo business.\n\ufeff\nOur clearing brokers provide securities financing arrangements including margin arrangements and securities borrowing and lending arrangements. These arrangements generally require us to transfer additional securities or cash to the clearing broker in the event the value of the securities then held by the clearing broker in the margin account falls below specified levels and contain events of default were we to breach our obligations under such agreements.\n\ufeff\nAn event of default under the clearing agreement would give the counterparty the option to terminate the clearing arrangement. Any amounts owed to the clearing broker would be immediately due and payable. These obligations are recourse to us. Furthermore, a termination of any of our clearing arrangements would result in a significant disruption to our business and would have a significant negative impact on our dealings and relationship with our customers.\n\ufeff\nThe following table presents our period end balance, average monthly balance, and maximum balance at any month end for receivables under resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReceivables under resale agreements\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod end\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,500,002 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,632,230 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMonthly average\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,458,757 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,492,390 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaximum month end\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,500,002 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,632,230 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod end\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,534,443 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,671,764 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMonthly average\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,501,691 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,531,355 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaximum month end\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,534,443 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,671,764 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nFluctuations in the balance of our repurchase agreements from period to period and intraperiod are dependent on business activity in those periods.

Due to the uncertainties that exist in the economy, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\ufeff\nOur accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results in our consolidated financial statements. Our industry is subject to a number of highly complex accounting rules and requirements many of which place heavy burdens on management to make judgments relating to our business. We encourage readers of this Form 10-K to read all of our critical accounting policies, which are included in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a full understanding of these issues and how the financial statements are impacted by these judgments. Certain of these policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and\nin accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\n\ufeff\nWe consider the accounting policies discussed below to be the policies that are the most impactful to our financial statements and also subject to significant management judgment.\n\ufeff\nValuation of Financial Instruments\n\ufeff\nHow fair value determinations impact our financial statements\n\ufeff\nAll of the securities we own that are classified as investments-trading, securities sold, not yet purchased, or other investments, at fair value are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value (both unrealized and realized) recorded in earnings.\n\ufeff\nUnrealized and realized gains and losses on securities classified as investments-trading in the consolidated balance sheets are recorded as a component of net trading revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on securities classified as other investments, at fair value, in the consolidated balance sheets are recorded as a component of principal transactions and other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we may hold, from time to time, trading securities sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated balance sheets that represent our obligations to deliver the specified security at the contracted price, thereby creating a liability to purchase the security in the market at prevailing prices. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities sold, not yet purchased are recorded as a component of net trading revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\ufeff\nHow we determine fair value for securities\n\ufeff\nWe account for our investment securities at fair value under various accounting literature, including Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities ( ASC 320\u201d), pertaining to investments in debt and equity securities and the fair value option of financial instruments in ASC 825, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825\u201d). We also account for certain assets at fair value under the applicable industry guidance, namely FASB ASC 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies ( ASC 946\u201d).\n\ufeff\nThe determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices of an active exchange, independent broker market quotations, market price quotations from third-party pricing services, or, when independent broker quotations or market price quotations from third-party pricing services are unavailable, valuation models prepared by management. These models include estimates and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange.\n\ufeff\nWe adopted the fair value measurement provisions in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d), applicable to financial assets and financial liabilities effective January 1, 2008. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability between market participants at the measurement date ( exit price\u201d). An exit price valuation will include margins for risk even if they are not observable. In accordance with ASC 820, we categorize our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below.\n\ufeff\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLevel 1\n</td> <td>\nFinancial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLevel 2\n</td> <td>\nFinancial assets and liabilities whose values are based on one or more of the following: (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; (c) pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or (d) pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLevel 3\n</td> <td>\nFinancial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. These inputs reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the valuation hierarchy. In such cases, the level of the valuation hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\n\ufeff\nFinancial instruments carried at contract amounts with short-term maturities (one year or less) are repriced frequently or bear market interest rates. Accordingly, those contracts are carried at amounts approximating fair value. Financial instruments carried at contract amounts on our consolidated balance sheets include receivables from and payables to brokers, securities purchased under agreements to resell ( reverse repurchase agreements\u201d or receivables under resale agreements\u201d), and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase ( repurchase agreements\u201d).\n\ufeff\nHow we determine fair value for investments in investment funds and similar vehicles\n\ufeff\nA portion of our other investments, at fair value represents investments in investment funds and other non-publicly traded entities that have the attributes of investment companies as described in ASC 946-15-2. We estimate the fair value of these entities using the reported net asset value per share as of the reporting date in accordance with the practical expedient\u201d provisions related to investments in certain entities that calculated net asset value per share (or its equivalent) included in ASC 820.\n\ufeff\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\ufeff\nWe do not utilize hedge accounting for our derivatives. Accordingly, all derivatives are carried at fair value with unrealized and realized gains recognized in earnings.\n\ufeff\nIf the derivative is expected to be managed by employees of our Capital Markets business segment or is a hedge for an investment classified as investments-trading, the derivative will be carried as a component of investments-trading if it is an asset or securities sold, not yet purchased if a liability. If the derivative is a hedge for an investment carried as a component of other investments, at fair value, the derivative will be recorded in other investments, at fair value.\n\ufeff\nWe may, from time to time, enter into derivatives to manage our risk exposures arising from (i) fluctuations in foreign currency rates with respect to our investments in foreign currency denominated investments; (ii) our investments in interest sensitive investments; and (iii) our facilitation of mortgage-backed trading. Derivatives entered into by us, from time to time, may include (i) foreign currency forward contracts; (ii) purchase and sale agreements of TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts; and (iii) other extended settlement trades.\n\ufeff\nTBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell mortgage-backed securities whose collateral remain to be announced\u201d until just prior to the trade settlement. In addition to TBAs, we sometimes enter into forward purchases or sales of agency mortgage-backed securities where the underlying collateral has been identified. These transactions are referred to as other forward agency MBS contracts. We account for TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts as derivatives.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts as part of our broker-dealer operations, we may from time to time enter into other securities or loan trades that do not settle within the normal securities settlement period. In those cases, the purchase or sale of the security or loan is not recorded until the settlement date. However, from the trade date until the settlement date, our interest in the security is accounted for as a derivative as either a forward purchase commitment or forward sale commitment.\n\ufeff\nDerivatives involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk, whereby changes in the level or volatility of interest rates or market values of the underlying financial instruments may result in changes in the value of a particular financial instrument in excess of its carrying amount. Depending on our investment strategy, realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in principal transactions and other income or in net trading in our consolidated statements of operations on a trade date basis.\n\ufeff\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\ufeff\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n\ufeff\nOur policy is to record penalties and interest as a component of provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur voting-controlled subsidiary, the Operating LLC, is treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in most of the states in which we do business. The Operating LLC is subject to entity level taxes in certain state and foreign jurisdictions. However, as a result of the Merger, we acquired significant deferred tax assets and liabilities and now have significant tax attributes. Effective as of January 1, 2010, we began to be treated as a C corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.\n\ufeff\nAs shown in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein, we currently have significant unrecognized deferred tax assets. These assets are unrecognized because we have recorded valuation allowances as we have determined that it is not more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these tax assets. However, this determination is ongoing and subject to change. If we were to change this determination in the future, a significant tax benefit would be recognized as a component of earnings.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition\n\ufeff\nNet trading\n\ufeff\nNet trading includes: (i) all gains, losses, interest income, dividend income, and interest expense from securities classified as investments-trading and trading securities sold, not yet purchased; (ii) interest income and expense from collateralized securities transactions; and (iii) commissions and riskless trading profits. Net trading is reduced by margin interest, which is recorded on an accrual basis.\n\ufeff\nRiskless trades are transacted through our proprietary account with a customer order in hand, resulting in little or no market risk to us. Transactions that settle in the regular way are recognized on a trade date basis. Extended settlement transactions are recognized on a settlement date basis (although in cases of extended settlement trades, the unsettled trade is accounted for as a derivative between trade and settlement date). See notes 3 and 10. The investments classified as trading are carried at fair value. The determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices of an active exchange, independent broker market quotations, market price quotations from third-party pricing services or, when independent broker quotations or market price quotations from third-party pricing services are unavailable, valuation models prepared by our management. The models include estimates, and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange. See note 9.\n\ufeff\nAsset management\n\ufeff\nAsset management revenue consists of management fees earned from Investment Vehicles. In the case of CDOs, the fees earned by us generally consist of senior, subordinated, and incentive fees.\n\ufeff\nThe senior asset management fee is generally senior to all the securities in the CDO capital structure and is recognized on a monthly basis as services are performed. The senior asset management fee is generally paid on a quarterly basis.\n\ufeff\nThe subordinated asset management fee is an additional payment for the same services but has a lower priority in the CDO cash flows. If the CDO experiences a certain level of asset defaults and deferrals, these fees may not be paid. There is no recovery by the CDO of previously paid subordinated asset management fees. It is our policy to recognize these fees on a monthly basis as services are performed. The subordinated asset management fee is generally paid on a quarterly basis. However, if we determine that the subordinated asset management fee will not be paid (which generally occurs on the quarterly payment date), we will stop recognizing additional subordinated asset management fees on that particular CDO and will reverse any subordinated asset management fees that are accrued and unpaid. We will begin accruing the subordinated asset management fee again if payment resumes and, in management's estimate, continued payment is reasonably assured. If payment were to resume but we were unsure of continued payment, we would recognize the subordinated asset management fee as payments were received and would not accrue such fees on a monthly basis.\n\ufeff\nThe incentive management fee is an additional payment, made typically after five to seven years of the life of a CDO, which is based on the clearance of an accumulated cash return on investment ( Hurdle Return\u201d) received by the most junior CDO securities holders. It is an incentive for us to perform in our role as asset manager by minimizing defaults and maximizing recoveries. The incentive management fee is not ultimately determined or payable until the achievement of the Hurdle Return by the most junior CDO securities holders. We recognize incentive fee revenue when it is probable and there is not a significant chance of reversal in the future.\n\ufeff\nIn the case of Investment Vehicles other than CDOs, generally we earn a base fee and, in some cases, also earns an incentive fee. Base fees will generally be recognized monthly as services are performed and will be paid monthly or quarterly. The contractual terms of each arrangement will determine our revenue recognition policy for incentive fees in each case. However, in all cases, we recognize the incentive fees when they are probable and there is not a significant chance of reversal in the future.\n\ufeff\nNew issue and advisory\n\ufeff\nNew issue and advisory revenue include: (i) new issue revenue associated with originating, arranging, or placing newly created financial instruments and (ii) revenue from advisory services. New issue and advisory revenue is recognized when all services have been provided and payment is earned.\n\ufeff\nPrincipal transactions and other income\n\ufeff\nPrincipal transactions include all gains, losses, and income (interest and dividend) from financial instruments classified as other investments, at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\ufeff\nThe investments classified as other investments, at fair value are carried at fair value. The determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices of an active exchange, independent broker market quotations, market price quotations or models from third-party pricing services, or, when independent broker quotations or market price quotations or models from third-party pricing services are unavailable, valuation models prepared by management. These models include estimates, and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date.\n\ufeff\nOther income / (loss) includes foreign currency gains and losses, interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, interest earned and losses incurred on notes receivable, and other miscellaneous income including revenue from revenue sharing arrangements.\n\ufeff\nVariable Interest Entities\n\ufeff\nFASB ASC 810, Consolidation ( ASC 810\u201d) contains the guidance surrounding the definition of VIEs, the definition of variable interests, and the consolidation rules surrounding VIEs. In general, VIEs are entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. As a general matter, a reporting entity must consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (a) the power to direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE's financial performance and (b) a significant variable interest in the VIE.\n\ufeff\nWe can potentially become involved with a VIE in three main ways:\n\ufeff\nOur Principal Investing Portfolio\n\ufeff\nFor each investment made within the principal investing portfolio, we assess whether the investee is a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. If we determine the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, we will consolidate it.\n\ufeff\nOur Asset Management Activities\n\ufeff\nFor each investment management contract, we enter into, we will assess whether the entity being managed is a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. If we determine the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, we will consolidate it.\n\ufeff\nOur Trading Portfolio\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, we may have an interest in a VIE through the investments we make as part of our trading activities. Because of the high volume of trading activity in which we engage, we do not perform a formal assessment of each individual investment within our trading portfolio to determine if the investee is a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. Even if we were to obtain a variable interest in a VIE through our trading portfolio, we would not be deemed to be the primary beneficiary for two main reasons: (a) we do not usually obtain the power to direct activities that most significantly impact any investee's financial performance and (b) a scope exception exists within the consolidation guidance for cases where the reporting entity is a broker-dealer and any control (either as the primary beneficiary of a VIE or through a controlling interest in a voting interest entity) was deemed to be temporary. In the unlikely case that we obtained the power to direct activities and obtained a significant variable interest in an investee in our trading portfolio that was a VIE, any such control would be deemed to be temporary due to the rapid turnover within the trading portfolio.\n\ufeff\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\ufeff\nThe following is a list of recent accounting pronouncements that, we believe, will have a continuing impact on our financial statements going forward. For a more complete list of recent pronouncements, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in this ASU require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial\nassets held at the reporting date to be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Our adoption of this ASU effective January 1, 2020 did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments in this ASU eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual or interim goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework -Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The ASU modifies the disclosure requirements in Topic 820, by removing certain disclosure requirements related to the valuation hierarchy, modifying existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adding new disclosure requirements such as disclosing the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and disclosing the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Target Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities. The ASU made targeted changes to the related party consolidation guidance. The new guidance changes how entities evaluate decision-making fees under the variable interest entity guidance. To determine whether decision-making fees represent a variable interest, an entity will need to consider indirect interests held through related parties under common control on a proportionate basis under the new guidance, rather than in their entirety, as has been the case under current guidance. The guidance is effective in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction Between Topic 808 and Topic 606. The ASU also provides more comparability in the presentation of revenue for certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants. It accomplishes this by allowing organizations to only present units of account in collaborative arrangements that are within the scope of the revenue recognition standard together with revenue accounted for under the revenue recognition standard. The parts of the collaborative arrangement that are not in the scope of the revenue recognition standard should be presented separately from revenue accounted for under the revenue recognition. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-08, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic (718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Codification Improvements- Share-Based Consideration Payable to a Customer. This ASU requires companies to measure and classify (on the balance sheet) share-based payments to customers by applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. As a result, the amount recorded as a reduction in revenue would be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU is intended to simplify accounting for income taxes. It removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim period with those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "\ufeff\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

advisory has been, and we expect will continue to be, volatile. We earn revenue from a limited number of engagements. Therefore, a small change in the number of engagements can result in large fluctuations in the revenue recognized. Further, even if the number of engagements remains consistent, the average revenue per engagement can fluctuate considerably. Finally, our revenue is generally earned when an underlying transaction closes (rather than on a monthly or quarterly basis). Therefore, the timing of underlying transactions increases the volatility of our revenue recognition.\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nU.S.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>565 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEurope\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,130 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,695 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nASSET MANAGEMENT\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCDOs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,919 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,848 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,071 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,617 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,049 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,568 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>12,536 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,897 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,639 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash compensation and benefits in the table above is primarily comprised of salary, incentive compensation, and benefits.

We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations. The remaining portion of our AUM is from a diversified mix of other Investment Vehicles most of which were more recently formed.\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReceivables under resale agreements\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod end\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,500,002 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,632,230 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMonthly average\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,458,757 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,492,390 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaximum month end\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,500,002 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,632,230 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod end\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,534,443 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,671,764 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMonthly average\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,501,691 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,531,355 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaximum month end\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,534,443 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,671,764 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur voting-controlled subsidiary, the Operating LLC, is treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in most of the states in which we do business.

In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nEquity-based compensation increased by $121 to $744 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $623 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was a result of a higher level of grants in 2019 as compared to 2018.

The following table shows the detail by trading group.\nThe original maturity date of the 2013 Convertible Notes was September 25, 2018. Immediately prior to maturity, the 2013 Convertible Notes were held by three parties. On September 25, 2018, we fully paid off one holder in the amount of $1,461. We entered into amendments with the holders of the remaining $6,786 aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Convertible Notes: the Edward E. Cohen IRA and the EBC 2013 Family Trust. Edward E. Cohen is the benefactor of the Edward E. Cohen IRA and is the father of Daniel G. Cohen, the chairman of our board of directors and the president and chief executive of our European operations and chairman of our board of directors. Daniel G. Cohen is a trustee of the EBC 2013 Family Trust. Pursuant to the amendments, (i) the maturity date of each of the 2013 Convertible Notes was extended from September 25, 2018 to September 25, 2019 and (ii) the conversion price under each of the 2013 Convertible Notes was reduced from $30.00 per share of Common Stock to $12.00 per share of Common Stock. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset Management\nOur accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results in our consolidated financial statements. Our industry is subject to a number of highly complex accounting rules and requirements many of which place heavy burdens on management to make judgments relating to our business. We encourage readers of this Form 10-K to read all of our critical accounting policies, which are included in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a full understanding of these issues and how the financial statements are impacted by these judgments. Certain of these policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and\n\ufeff\nWe have seven primary uses for capital:\n (2) The holder of the 2017 Convertible Note may convert all or any part of the outstanding principal amount at any time prior to maturity into units of the Operating LLC at a conversion price of $1.45 per unit, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Units of the membership interests of Operating LLC not held by Cohen & Company Inc. may, with certain restrictions, be redeemed and exchanged into shares of Common Stock on a ten-for-one basis. Therefore, the 2017 Convertible Note can be converted into Operating LLC units of membership interests and then redeemed and exchanged into Common Stock at an effective conversion price of $14.50. \nRevenue Recognition\nPrincipal Transactions and Other Income\n \u00b7 During the fourth quarter of 2017, we purchased 27,346 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $273 or $10.00 per share from a former member of the board of directors, who was a director at the time of purchase. \n o Effective October 1, 2019, the DGC Trust / CBF redeemable financial instruments were amended and restated. The definition of Investment Return (as defined in the agreements) was modified in both the DGC Trust and CBF agreements. The Investment Amount was reduced by $1,500 in the CBF agreement and the Company made a $1,500 one-time payment to CBF. \nIn addition, we often incur certain costs related to new issue engagements. These costs are included as a component of either subscriptions, clearing and execution, or professional fees and other and will generally be recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized.\nCDOs\nProfessional Fee and Other Operating Expenses\nOur Principal Investing Portfolio\nOur CLO investments represented investments in the most junior tranche of certain CLOs. The average carrying value of our CLO investments for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11,384, as compared to $5,289 for the year ended December 31, 2017. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about how we determine the value of these instruments.\nFor each investment management contract, we enter into, we will assess whether the entity being managed is a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary.

As a result of the successful auction, our deferred subordinated management fees were paid as well as other one-time fees associated with termination. The total revenue earned on this CDO was $434 and $592 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition to this decrease, we experienced a decline in revenues earned from the remaining CDOs primarily due to principal payments on the assets in these securitizations.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nProfessional fee and other operating expenses increased by $1,114, or 15%, to $8,459 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $7,345 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was comprised of an increase of $1,140 in professional fees; partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses of $26. Professional fees increased due to sub-advisory fees incurred in connection with the successful auction of the Alesco II CDO managed by DCM, as well as a finder's fee incurred in connection with new issue and advisory revenue earned by JVB for the origination of financial assets.\nAsset Management:\n\ufeff\nThe tax benefit recognized in 2018 was comprised of a current tax benefit of $3 and a deferred tax benefit of $838. The deferred tax benefit was a U.S. tax benefit which was the result of the net loss incurred by us in 2018. This net loss provides additional NOL carryforwards that can be recognized as a benefit to the extent such NOLs can scheduled against our deferred tax liability reversal.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework -Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The ASU modifies the disclosure requirements in Topic 820, by removing certain disclosure requirements related to the valuation hierarchy, modifying existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adding new disclosure requirements such as disclosing the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and disclosing the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nDerivatives involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk, whereby changes in the level or volatility of interest rates or market values of the underlying financial instruments may result in changes in the value of a particular financial instrument in excess of its carrying amount. Depending on our investment strategy, realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in principal transactions and other income or in net trading in our consolidated statements of operations on a trade date basis.\nUnrealized and realized gains and losses on securities classified as investments-trading in the consolidated balance sheets are recorded as a component of net trading revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on securities classified as other investments, at fair value, in the consolidated balance sheets are recorded as a component of principal transactions and other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nSubscriptions, clearing, and execution increased by $1,055, or 12%, to $9,682 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $8,627 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to increases of $326 in subscriptions and $729 in clearing and execution. The increase in clearing and execution was due to increased trading volume.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur Trading Portfolio\n\ufeff\n (2) The interest on the junior subordinated notes related to Alesco Capital Trust I is variable. The interest rate of 5.94% (based on a 90-day LIBOR rate in effect as of December 31, 2019 plus 4.00%) was used to compute the contractual interest payment in each period noted. The interest on the junior subordinated notes related to Sunset Financial Statutory Trust I is variable. The interest rate of 6.11% (based on a 90-day LIBOR rate in effect as of December 31, 2019 plus 4.15%) was used to compute the contractual interest payment in each period noted. \nCompensation and benefits increased by $587, or 2%, to $25,972 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $25,385 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAsset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - U.S. increased primarily because the Alesco II CDO successfully auctioned off its assets and liquidated. As a result of the successful auction, our deferred subordinated management fees were paid. As a result, we recorded revenue of $2,997 and related professional fees and other expense of $999 in 2018. The total revenue earned on this CDO was $3,211 and $304 for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We will no longer earn any revenue in the future from this securitization. Except as set forth above, asset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - U.S. declined as compared to 2017 because AUM declined primarily due to principal repayments on the assets of these securitizations.\nOur currency hedge consisted of a Euro forward agreement designed to hedge the currency risk primarily associated with our investment in EuroDekania.\n\ufeff\n or acquisition activities, we may need to raise additional funding through an equity or debt offering. No assurances can be given that additional financing will be available in the future, or that if available, such financing will be on favorable terms. \n\ufeff\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe CLO investments represent investments in the most junior tranche of certain CLOs. The average carrying value of our CLO investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2,662 as compared to $11,384 for the year ended December 31, 2018. These investments are carried at fair value. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about how we determine the value of these instruments.\nIn addition, we may hold, from time to time, trading securities sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated balance sheets that represent our obligations to deliver the specified security at the contracted price, thereby creating a liability to purchase the security in the market at prevailing prices. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities sold, not yet purchased are recorded as a component of net trading revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur clearing brokers provide securities financing arrangements including margin arrangements and securities borrowing and lending arrangements. These arrangements generally require us to transfer additional securities or cash to the clearing broker in the event the value of the securities then held by the clearing broker in the margin account falls below specified levels and contain events of default were we to breach our obligations under such agreements.\nOther Business and Transactions\nA portion of our revenues is generated from our principal investing activities. Therefore, our revenues are impacted by the overall market supply and demand of these investments as well as the individual performance of each investment. Our principal investments are included within other investments, at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u00b7 Principal Investing: Our Principal Investing business segment is comprised of investments that we have made for the purpose of earning an investment return rather than investments made to support our trading, matched book repo, or other Capital Markets business segment activities. These investments are a component of our other investments, at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. \nAsset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - Europe declined. In June 2018, the Dekania Europe I CDO had a successful auction of its assets and liquidated. During 2018, the Company recorded management fee revenue of $435 associated with the Dekania Europe I CDO. The remaining reduction in asset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - Europe was a result a decline in AUM due to principal repayments on the assets in these securitizations.\n\ufeff\nBusiness Development, Occupancy, and Equipment\n (4) Represents the interest rate in effect as of the last day of the reporting period. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 During 2017: \nin accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nThe 2019 Senior Notes\n\ufeff\nThe cash provided by investing activities of $3,734 was comprised of (a) $10,114 of sales and returns of principal from other investments, at fair value, partially offset by (b) $4,352 of cash used to invest in an equity method affiliate (see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), (c) $101 of cash used to purchase furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and (d) $1,927 of cash used to purchase other investments, at fair value.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts as part of our broker-dealer operations, we may from time to time enter into other securities or loan trades that do not settle within the normal securities settlement period. In those cases, the purchase or sale of the security or loan is not recorded until the settlement date. However, from the trade date until the settlement date, our interest in the security is accounted for as a derivative as either a forward purchase commitment or forward sale commitment.\nPrincipal Transactions\n\ufeff\nProfessional fee and other operating expenses decreased by $2,208, or 26%, to $6,251 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $8,459 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was due to decreases of $2,098 in professional fees and $110 in other operating expense. The professional fee decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in consulting costs related to new issue revenue incurred in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to less new issue revenue earned in 2019. In addition, in 2018, we incurred sub-advisory fees in connection with the successful auction of the Alesco II CDO managed by DCM. No CDOs were the subject of a successful auction during 2019.\nOperating expenses increased by $5,587, or 14%, to $45,727 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $40,140 for the year ended December 31, 2017. As discussed in more detail below, the change was comprised of (i) an increase of $2,858 in compensation and benefits; (ii) an increase of $272 in business development, occupancy, and equipment; (iii) an increase of $1,331 in subscriptions, clearing, and execution; (iv) an increase of $1,114 in professional fee and other operating; and (v) an increase of $12 in depreciation and amortization.\nFluctuations in the balance of our repurchase agreements from period to period and intraperiod are dependent on business activity in those periods. The fluctuations in the balances of our receivables under resale agreements over the periods presented were impacted by our clients' desires to execute collateralized financing arrangements through the repurchase market or other financing products.\n\ufeff\nOther asset management revenue decreased by $1,085 to $3,532 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $4,617 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower performance fees being earned on managed accounts in 2019 as compared 2018.\n \u00b7 During the fourth quarter of 2019, we purchased 1,000 shares of Common Stock for $5 or $4.50 per share from the Company's chief financial officer. \nInvestment in CK Capital Partners B.V. and AOI\n \ufeff Level 1 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. \ufeff Level 2 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on one or more of the following: (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; (c) pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or (d) pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \ufeff Level 3 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. These inputs reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. \nThe tax benefit recognized in 2019 was comprised of a deferred tax benefit of $678 partially offset by current tax expense of $155. The current tax expense incurred in 2019 was primarily the result of foreign income tax. The deferred tax benefit was a U.S. tax benefit, which was the result of the net loss incurred by us in 2019. This net loss provides additional net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards which can be recognized as a benefit to the extent such NOLs can scheduled against our deferred tax liability reversal.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n (1) Assumes the 2017 Convertible Note is not converted prior to maturity. \nIn August 2018, we invested in and became the general partner of a series of newly formed partnerships, the SPAC Funds, for the purposes of investing in the equity securities of SPACs. Cohen & Company Financial Management, LLC, a registered investment adviser subsidiary of the Company ( CCFM\u201d), is the manager of the SPAC Funds. As of December 31, 2019, we had invested $646 in the SPAC Funds. We are entitled to a quarterly base management fee based on a percentage of the net asset value of the SPAC Funds and an annual incentive allocation based on the actual returns earned by the SPAC Funds.

Beginning in 2012, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per quarter, which was paid regularly through the first quarter of 2019. Each time a cash dividend was declared by our board of directors, a pro rata distribution was made to the other members of the Operating LLC upon payment of dividends to our stockholders.\nAll of the repurchases noted above were completed using cash on hand.\nThe following is a list of recent accounting pronouncements that, we believe, will have a continuing impact on our financial statements going forward.

This increase was comprised of an increase of $97 in business development and an increase in occupancy and equipment of $175. Occupancy and equipment increased primarily due to our entry into a new office lease for office space in New York City, which commenced in August 2018.\n\ufeff\nPrincipal transactions and other income decreased by $2,470 to $2,103 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $4,573 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCompensation and benefits increased by $2,858, or 13%, to $25,385 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $22,527 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nused for the partial redemption of a redeemable financial instrument (see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); (e) $128 of cash used to net settle equity awards; (f) $299 of cash used to purchase and retire Common Stock, (g) $213 of cash used for distributions to the non-controlling interests of the Operating LLC; and (h) $519 of cash used to pay Common Stock dividends.\nProfessional Fee and Other Operating Expenses\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nCohen & Company Financial (Europe) Limited\nSubscriptions, Clearing, and Execution\n\ufeff\n same, except that (i) the maturity date thereof changed from September 25, 2019 to September 25, 2020; (ii) the conversion feature in the 2013 Convertible Notes was removed; (iii) the interest rate thereunder changed from 8% per annum (9% in the event of certain events of default) to 12% per annum (13% in the event of certain events of default); and (iv) the restrictions regarding prepayment were removed. The post-amendment notes are referred to herein as the 2019 Senior Notes\u201d and the pre-amendment notes are referred to herein as the 2013 Convertible Notes.\u201d \n\ufeff\nAsset management\n (1) Non-controlling interest is recorded on a monthly basis. Because earnings are recognized unevenly throughout the year and the non-controlling interest percentage may change during the period, the average effective non-controlling interest percentage may not equal the percentage at the end of any period or the simple average of the beginning and ending percentages. \n\ufeff\nIf the derivative is expected to be managed by employees of our Capital Markets business segment or is a hedge for an investment classified as investments-trading, the derivative will be carried as a component of investments-trading if it is an asset or securities sold, not yet purchased if a liability. If the derivative is a hedge for an investment carried as a component of other investments, at fair value, the derivative will be recorded in other investments, at fair value.\nAssets Under Management\nIf there were an event of default under a repurchase agreement, the counterparty would have the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and make any amount due from us to the counterparty payable immediately. Repurchase obligations are full recourse obligations to us. If we were to default under a repurchase obligation, the counterparty would have recourse to our other assets if the collateral was not sufficient to satisfy our obligations in full. Most of our repurchase agreements are entered into as part of our matched book repo business.\n\ufeff\n (4) The redeemable financial instruments require certain variable payments be made by us based on revenues earned by certain of our operations. The amounts shown here represent the minimum amount of payments that would be due under these instruments. \n\ufeff\nNon-Operating Income and Expense\nNet trading\nIf we are unable to raise sufficient capital on economically favorable terms, we may need to reduce the amount of capital invested for the uses described above, which may adversely impact earnings and our ability to pay dividends.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 The IIFC revenue share arrangement expires at the earlier of (i) the dissolution of IIFC or (ii) when we have earned a cumulative $20,000 in revenue share payments. Through December 31, 2019, we have earned $2,716 in the aggregate. Also, in any particular year, the revenue share earned by us cannot exceed $2,000. \nSecurities Purchase Agreement - Purchase of IMXI shares\n\ufeff\n (2) To fund the expansion of our Asset Management business segment. We generally grow our AUM by sponsoring new Investment Vehicles. The creation of a new Investment Vehicle often requires us to invest a certain amount of our own capital to attract outside capital to manage. Also, these new Investment Vehicles often require warehouse and other third-party financing to fund the acquisition of investments. Finally, we generally will hire employees to manage new Investment Vehicles and will operate at a loss for a startup period. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nassets held at the reporting date to be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Our adoption of this ASU effective January 1, 2020 did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOther\n (1) To fund the operations of our Capital Markets business segment. Our Capital Markets business segment utilizes capital (i) to fund securities inventory to facilitate client trading activities; (ii) for risk trading for our own account; (iii) to fund our collateralized securities lending activities; (iv) for temporary capital needs associated with underwriting activities; (v) to fund business expansion into existing or new product lines including additional capital dedicated to our mortgage group as well as our matched book repo business; and (vi) to fund any operating losses incurred. \nAsset management fees for broadly syndicated loans - Europe consist of a single CLO. During August 2019, this CLO liquidated. Of the revenue earned in 2019, $452 represented fees earned by us upon successful liquidation. No significant future revenue will be earned related to this management contract.\nRevenues increased by $1,844, or 4%, to $49,386 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $47,542 for the year ended December 31, 2017. As discussed in more detail below, the change was comprised of (i) an increase of $2,389 in net trading revenue; (ii) an increase of $4,639 in asset management revenue; (iii) a decrease of $3,361 in new issue and advisory revenue; and (iv) a decrease of $1,823 in principal transactions and other income.\n o We raised $11,000 in proceeds from redeemable financial instruments: $10,000 by issuing redeemable financial instruments to CBF and the DGC Trust; and, $1,000 in additional proceeds from the already issued redeemable financial instrument to JKD Capital Partners I LTD. \nThe investments classified as other investments, at fair value are carried at fair value. The determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices of an active exchange, independent broker market quotations, market price quotations or models from third-party pricing services, or, when independent broker quotations or market price quotations or models from third-party pricing services are unavailable, valuation models prepared by management. These models include estimates, and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date.\n\ufeff\n\nWe consider the accounting policies discussed below to be the policies that are the most impactful to our financial statements and also subject to significant management judgment.\nU.S. Insurance JV\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents were $8,304, representing a decrease of $5,802 from December 31, 2018. The decrease was attributable to the cash used by operating activities of $15,463, the cash provided by investing activities of $3,734, the cash provided in financing activities of $5,936, and the decrease in cash resulting from a change in exchange rates of $9.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense, net\nSubscriptions, clearing, and execution increased by $1,331, or 18%, to $8,627 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $7,296 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was comprised of increases in subscriptions of $457 and clearing and execution of $874. The subscriptions increase was primarily the result of increases in Bloomberg licensing charges and new subscriptions to support the ViaNova business. The increase in clearing and execution was due to increased trading volume and a full year of operation in 2018 for our GCF matched repo business.\n\ufeff\nFinancial Conduct Authority ( FCA\u201d) and CCFEL is regulated by the CBI and both must maintain certain minimum levels of capital. See note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEquity-based compensation decreased by $109 to $623 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $732 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decline was the result of there being no restricted stock grants to the board of directors during 2018. There were grants to the board of directors during 2017. See note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe income tax expense / (benefit) was ($523) for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to ($841) for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n (5) To fund potential dividends and distributions. During the third quarter of 2010 and for each subsequent quarter through March 31, 2019, the board of directors declared a dividend. A pro rata distribution was paid to the other members of the Operating LLC upon the payment of any dividends to our stockholders. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 During 2018: \n o We amended and restructured the 2018 FT LOC and issued a new subordinated revolving note, the 2019 FT Revolver. We have not borrowed under the 2018 FT LOC or the 2019 FT LOC. \n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $22,933, representing an increase of $7,717 from December 31, 2016. The increase was attributable to the cash used by operating activities of $11,916, the cash used by investing activities of $3,896, the cash provided in financing activities of $23,118, and the increase in cash resulting from a change in exchange rates of $411.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Incentive management fees earned based on the performance of the certain Investment Vehicles. \nMargins and volumes in certain products and markets within the fixed income brokerage business continue to decrease materially as competition has increased and general market activity has declined. Further, we continue to expect that competition will increase over time, resulting in continued margin pressure.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nAs shown in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein, we currently have significant unrecognized deferred tax assets. These assets are unrecognized because we have recorded valuation allowances as we have determined that it is not more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these tax assets. However, this determination is ongoing and subject to change. If we were to change this determination in the future, a significant tax benefit would be recognized as a component of earnings.\n\ufeff\nNet trading revenue increased by $2,389, or 9%, to $29,298 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $26,909 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table shows the detail by trading group.\nEuroDekania was an investment company and we carried our investment at the NAV of the fund. Income recognized in each period was the result of changes in the underlying NAV of the fund as well as distributions received. Our investment in EuroDekania was denominated in Euros. We sometimes hedged this exposure (as described in greater detail below). EuroDekania was liquidated in 2019.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIMXI represents unrestricted and restricted equity positions of International Money Express, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMXI), a publicly traded company that resulted from the merger of Intermex Holdings, LLC and FinTech Acquisition Corp. II. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about how we determine the value of these instruments. Also see note 4 and 31 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn December 2019, we acquired a 45% interest in CK Capital Partners B.V. ( CK Capital\u201d), a private company incorporated in the Netherlands. CK Capital provides asset and investment advisory services relating to real estate holdings. We purchased this interest for $18 (of which $17 was from an entity controlled by our chairman, Daniel G. Cohen.) In addition, we also acquired a 10% interest in Amersfoort Office Investment I Cooperatief U. A. ( AOI\u201d), a real estate holding company, for $1 and subsequently invested $558. The investments in AOI and CK Capital Partners are included in equity method investments on the consolidated balance sheets. See notes 4,12, and 31 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n (1) On September 25, 2019, we amended and restated the previously outstanding 2013 Convertible Notes, which were scheduled to mature September 25, 2019. The material terms and conditions of the 2013 Convertible Notes remained substantially the \nAverage balances and period end balances will fluctuate based on market and liquidity conditions and we consider such intraperiod fluctuations as typical for the repurchase market. Month-end balances may be higher or lower than average period balances.\n o The Company entered into the SPA with Daniel G. Cohen and DGC Trust effective December 30, 2019. This transaction combined with the related issuance of series F preferred stock resulted in an increases in non-controlling interest of $7,779 and an increase in preferred stock of $22. See note 4 and 31 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense / (benefit) was $(841) for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to income tax expense / (benefit) of $(1,211) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The tax benefit recognized in 2018 was comprised of a current tax benefit of $4 and a deferred tax benefit of $837. The deferred tax benefit recognized in 2018 was the result of the net loss incurred by us in 2018. This net loss provided additional NOL carryforwards that can be recognized as a benefit to the extent such carryforwards can be scheduled against our deferred tax liability reversal. The tax benefit recognized in 2017 was comprised of $1,279 of deferred tax benefit, partially offset by $68 of current tax expense. The deferred tax benefit recognized in 2017 was primarily the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA\u201d). Among other things, the TCJA reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, we revalued our deferred tax liability and recognized a one-time tax deferred income tax benefit.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFASB ASC 810, Consolidation ( ASC 810\u201d) contains the guidance surrounding the definition of VIEs, the definition of variable interests, and the consolidation rules surrounding VIEs. In general, VIEs are entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. As a general matter, a reporting entity must consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (a) the power to direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE's financial performance and (b) a significant variable interest in the VIE.\n\ufeff\nThe Sponsor Entities raised $2,550 from third-party investors and the remaining investment in the private placement was made by the Company. The Company consolidates the Sponsor Entities and treats its investment in the Insurance SPAC as an equity method investment. The $2,550 raised from third-party investors is treated as non-controlling interest. See notes 4 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe SPAC Funds primarily invest in the equity of SPACs and we carry our investment at its reported NAV. Income recognized in each period is the result of changes in the underlying NAV of the SPAC Funds as well as distributions received. See notes 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n o We entered into a credit facility with LegacyTexas Bank (the LegacyTexas Credit Facility\u201d) related to our ViaNova business line, which provides for draws up to $12,500. \nCapital Markets:\n\ufeff\nWe are a financial services company specializing in fixed income markets. We were founded in 1999 as an investment firm focused on small-cap banking institutions but have grown to provide an expanding range of capital markets and asset management services. We are organized into three business segments: Capital Markets, Asset Management, and Principal Investing.\n\ufeff\nNew issue and advisory revenue include: (i) new issue revenue associated with originating, arranging, or placing newly created financial instruments and (ii) revenue from advisory services. New issue and advisory revenue is recognized when all services have been provided and payment is earned.\nIncome Tax Expense / (Benefit)\nOn March 22, 2019, the Insurance SPAC completed the sale of 15,065,000 units (the SPAC Units\u201d) in its initial public offering (the IPO\u201d). Each SPAC Unit consists of one share of the SPAC's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ( SPAC Common Stock\u201d), and one-half of one warrant (each, a SPAC Warrant\u201d), where each whole SPAC Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The SPAC Units were sold in the IPO at an offering price of $10.00 per SPAC Unit, for gross proceeds of $150,650 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Pursuant to the underwriting agreement in the IPO, the Insurance SPAC granted the underwriters in the IPO (the Underwriters\u201d) a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,965,000 additional SPAC Units solely to cover over-allotments, if any (the Over-Allotment Option\u201d); and on March 22, 2019, the Underwriters exercised the Over-Allotment Option in full. Immediately following the completion of the IPO, there were an aggregate of 20,653,333 shares of SPAC Common Stock issued and outstanding.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-08, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic (718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Codification Improvements- Share-Based Consideration Payable to a Customer. This ASU requires companies to measure and classify (on the balance sheet) share-based payments to customers by applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. As a result, the amount recorded as a reduction in revenue would be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $903, or 11%, to $7,584 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $8,487 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we often incur certain costs related to new issue engagements. These costs are included as a component of either subscriptions, clearing and execution, or professional fees and other and will generally be recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nPrincipal Transactions\n\ufeff\nNew issue and advisory revenue decreased by $1,148, or 39%, to $1,831 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $2,979 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nAsset management revenue from Company-sponsored CDOs decreased by $3,891 to $4,028 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $7,919 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the periods presented by asset class.\nA substantial portion of our asset management fees are earned from the management of CDOs. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations.\nAmendments to 2013 Convertible Notes\nWe believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and other sources of credit. Due to the uncertainties that exist in the economy, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future.\nRedeemable Financial Instruments\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU is intended to simplify accounting for income taxes. It removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim period with those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nSPAC Funds\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCompensation and Benefits\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nOur AUM equals the sum of: (1) the gross assets included in CDOs that we have sponsored and manage; plus (2) the NAV of investment funds we manage; plus (3) the NAV or gross assets of other accounts we manage.\nInterest Expense, net\nOther income / (loss) includes foreign currency gains and losses, interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, interest earned and losses incurred on notes receivable, and other miscellaneous income including revenue from revenue sharing arrangements.\nInterest expense, net increased by $2,309, or 37%, to $8,487 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $6,178 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments in this ASU eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual or interim goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nEuroDekania was a company that invested in hybrid capital securities of European companies and we carried our investment at the reported NAV. Income recognized in each period was the result of changes in the underlying NAV of the fund as well as distributions received. EuroDekania sold its remaining investments and liquidated in 2019.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIn addition, as a smaller firm, we are exposed to intense competition. Although we provide financing to our customers, larger firms have a much greater capability to provide their clients with financing, giving them a competitive advantage. We are much more reliant upon our employees' relationships, networks, and abilities to identify and capitalize on market opportunities. Therefore, our business may be significantly impacted by the addition or loss of key personnel.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 During the fourth quarter of 2019, we purchased 23,000 shares of Common Stock for $230 or $10.00 per share from a former member of the board of directors. \nOn September 1, 2017, we filed two Articles of Amendment to our charter with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, pursuant to which we (i) changed our name to Cohen & Company Inc.\u201d; (ii) effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (iii) increased the par value of our Common Stock from $0.001 per share to $0.01 per share. All share and per share amounts for all periods presented herein reflect the reverse split as if it had occurred as of the beginning of the first period presented.\n\ufeff\nOn September 25, 2019, we amended and restated the previously outstanding 2013 Convertible Notes that were scheduled to mature on September 25, 2019. The material terms and conditions of the 2013 Convertible Notes remained substantially the same, except that (i) the maturity date thereof changed from September 25, 2019 to September 25, 2020; (ii) the conversion feature in the 2013 Convertible Notes was removed; (iii) the interest rate thereunder changed from 8% per annum (9% in the event of certain events of default) to 12% per annum (13% in the event of certain events of default); and (iv) the restrictions regarding prepayment were removed. The post amendment notes are referred to herein as the 2019 Senior Notes\u201d and the pre-amendment notes are referred to herein as the 2013 Convertible Notes.\u201d See note 33 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the issuance of the 2020 Senior Notes and partial repayment of the 2019 Senior Notes.\n\ufeff\nTherefore, subsequent to the SPA and taking into account the SPA Proxy, Cohen & Company Inc. own 28.75% of the economic interests of the Operating LLC and controls 51.00% of the voting interests of the Operating LLC. Because Cohen & Company Inc. continues to maintain voting control of the Operating LLC, Cohen & Company Inc. will continue to consolidate the Operating LLC in its consolidated financial statements. However, earnings shall be allocated to Cohen & Company Inc. and the other members of the Operating LLC based on their respective economic interests. Accordingly, the non-controlling interest percentage reflected in the consolidated statement of operations will change from 32.22% immediately prior to the effectiveness of the SPA to 71.25% immediately subsequent to the effectiveness of the SPA.\n o We raised an additional $1,268 from redeemable financial instruments via an additional investment by JKD Capital Partners I on January 9, 2019. On March 6, 2019, the agreement was amended to change the definition of Investment Return (as defined in the agreement). \n\ufeff\nOther asset management revenue increased by $2,568 to $4,617 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $2,049 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to performance fees being earned on and increases in the AUM of our managed accounts during 2018.\n\ufeff\nOur business environment is rapidly changing. New risks and uncertainties emerge continuously and it is not possible for us to predict all the risks we will face. This may negatively impact our operating performance.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nA substantial portion of our asset management revenue is earned from the management of CDOs. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNew issue and advisory\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Net interest income on our matched book repo financing activities; and \n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, we may have an interest in a VIE through the investments we make as part of our trading activities. Because of the high volume of trading activity in which we engage, we do not perform a formal assessment of each individual investment within our trading portfolio to determine if the investee is a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. Even if we were to obtain a variable interest in a VIE through our trading portfolio, we would not be deemed to be the primary beneficiary for two main reasons: (a) we do not usually obtain the power to direct activities that most significantly impact any investee's financial performance and (b) a scope exception exists within the consolidation guidance for cases where the reporting entity is a broker-dealer and any control (either as the primary beneficiary of a VIE or through a controlling interest in a voting interest entity) was deemed to be temporary. In the unlikely case that we obtained the power to direct activities and obtained a significant variable interest in an investee in our trading portfolio that was a VIE, any such control would be deemed to be temporary due to the rapid turnover within the trading portfolio.\nNet income / (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was comprised of the non-controlling interest related to member interests in the Operating LLC other than interests held by us for the relevant periods. In addition, net income / (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest also included non-controlling interest related to entities that were consolidated but not wholly owned by the Operating LLC.\n\ufeff\nPerformance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of the economy and financial market activity. Overall market conditions are a product of many factors beyond our control and can be unpredictable. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors including the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets, the level and shape of the various yield curves, and the volume and value of trading in securities.\nOur net trading revenue includes unrealized gains on our trading investments as of the applicable measurement date, which may never be realized due to changes in market or other conditions not in our control. This may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from these investments. In addition, our net trading revenue also includes realized gains on certain proprietary trading positions. Our ability to derive trading gains from such trading positions is subject to overall market conditions. Due to volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, the net trading revenue recognized during any year may not be indicative of future results. Furthermore, from time to time, some of the assets included in the Investments-trading line of our consolidated balance sheets represent level 3 valuations within the FASB valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets are carried at fair value based on estimates derived using internal valuation models and other estimates. See notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The fair value estimates determined by us may not be indicative of the final sale price at which these assets may be sold.\n o We raised $500 in proceeds from redeemable financial instruments related to ViaNova. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nThe revenue share arrangements noted in the table above entitle us to either a percentage of revenue earned by certain entities or a percentage of revenue earned above certain thresholds. See discussion of revenue share arrangements in Item 1 - Business\u201d beginning on page 5. These arrangements expire, or have expired, as follows:\n\ufeff\n (6) To fund potential repurchases of Common Stock. We have opportunistically repurchased Common Stock in private transactions as well through the 10b5-1 Plan. See note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nOur response to this margin compression has included: (i) building a diversified fixed income trading platform; (ii) acquiring or building out new product lines and expanding existing product lines; (iii) building a hedging execution and funding operation to service mortgage originators; (iv) becoming a full netting member of the FICC enabling us to expand our matched book repo business, and (v) monitoring our fixed costs. Our cost management initiatives are ongoing. However, there can be no certainty that these efforts will be sufficient. If insufficient, we will likely see a decline in profitability.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nSee notes 21 and 31 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nNon-Operating Income and Expense\nWe maintain repurchase agreements with various third-party financial institutions. There is no maximum limit as to the amount of securities that may be transferred pursuant to these agreements, and transactions are approved on a case-by-case basis. The repurchase agreements do not include substantive provisions other than those covenants and other customary provisions contained in standard master repurchase agreements. The repurchase agreements generally require us to transfer additional securities to the counterparty in the event the value of the securities then held by the counterparty in the margin account falls below specified levels and contain events of default were we to breach our obligations under the agreement. We receive margin calls from our repurchase agreement counterparties from time to time in the ordinary course of business. To date, we have maintained sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls, and we have never been unable to satisfy a margin call, however, no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy requests from our counterparties to post additional collateral in the future. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHow fair value determinations impact our financial statements\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 The Star Asia revenue share arrangement terminated during 2018. \n\ufeff\nWe adopted the fair value measurement provisions in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d), applicable to financial assets and financial liabilities effective January 1, 2008. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability between market participants at the measurement date ( exit price\u201d). An exit price valuation will include margins for risk even if they are not observable. In accordance with ASC 820, we categorize our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe account for our investment securities at fair value under various accounting literature, including Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities ( ASC 320\u201d), pertaining to investments in debt and equity securities and the fair value option of financial instruments in ASC 825, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825\u201d). We also account for certain assets at fair value under the applicable industry guidance, namely FASB ASC 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies ( ASC 946\u201d).\n\ufeff\n o We entered into the 2018 FT LOC credit facility with Fifth Third Bank ( FT Financial\u201d). Nothing has been drawn on this facility to date. \n\ufeff\n o We issued the 2017 Convertible Note in an aggregate principal amount of $15,000 to the DGC Trust. \n\ufeff\nNet trading includes: (i) all gains, losses, interest income, dividend income, and interest expense from securities classified as investments-trading and trading securities sold, not yet purchased; (ii) interest income and expense from collateralized securities transactions; and (iii) commissions and riskless trading profits. Net trading is reduced by margin interest, which is recorded on an accrual basis.\nWe consider our matched book repo business to be subject to significant concentration risk. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet Trading\n\ufeff\n (3) Represents redemption value of the redeemable financial instruments as of the reporting period. The redeemable financial instruments do not have a fixed maturity date. The period shown above represents the first period the holder of these instruments has the ability to require redemption by us. \n2019 Cash Flows\n\ufeff\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 7,890 shares in the open market under the 10b5-1 Plan for a total purchase price of $65. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 57,526 shares in the open market under the 10b5-1 Plan for a total purchase price of $594. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 15,270 shares in the open market under the 10b5-1 Plan for a total purchase price of $149.\n\ufeff\nWe may, from time to time, enter into derivatives to manage our risk exposures arising from (i) fluctuations in foreign currency rates with respect to our investments in foreign currency denominated investments; (ii) our investments in interest sensitive investments; and (iii) our facilitation of mortgage-backed trading. Derivatives entered into by us, from time to time, may include (i) foreign currency forward contracts; (ii) purchase and sale agreements of TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts; and (iii) other extended settlement trades.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNet income / (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was comprised of the non-controlling interest related to member interests in the Operating LLC other than interests held by us for the relevant periods. In addition, net income / (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest also included non-controlling interest related to entities that were consolidated but not wholly owned by the Operating LLC.\n\ufeff\nAsset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - U.S. declined. In October 2018, the Alesco II CDO had a successful auction of its assets and liquidated. During 2018, the Company recorded management fee revenue of $3,211 associated with the Alesco II CDO, which included $2,974 earned upon the successful auction. The remaining reduction in asset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - U.S. was a result of average AUM declining due to principal repayments on the assets in these securitizations.\nPrincipal Investing:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe cash provided by investing activities of $2,156 was comprised of (a) $30,023 of sales and returns of principal from other investments, at fair value, partially offset by (b) $1,002 of cash used to purchase furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and (c) $26,865 of cash used to purchase other investments, at fair value.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nThe cash provided in financing activities of $5,936 was comprised of (a) $1,268 of proceeds from redeemable financing instrument (see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); (b) $4,777 in proceeds from net draws on the LegacyTexas Credit Facility (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); (c) $2,550 in proceeds from the issuance of non-controlling interests); partially offset by (d) $1,500 of cash\n\ufeff\nPrincipal Transactions and Other Income\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nBusiness Environment\nOur Asset Management Activities\n\ufeff\nNew Issue and Advisory Revenue\n\ufeff\nWe are the manager and a member of each of two entities: Insurance Acquisition Sponsor, LLC and Dioptra Advisors, LLC (together, the Sponsor Entities\u201d). The Sponsor Entities purchased 375,000 of the Insurance SPAC's placement units in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the IPO for an aggregate of $3,750, or $10.00 per placement unit. Each placement unit consists of one share of SPAC Common Stock and one-half of one warrant (the Placement Warrant\u201d). The placement units are identical to the SPAC Units sold in the IPO except (i) the shares of SPAC Common Stock issued as part of the placement units and the Placement Warrants will not be redeemable by the Insurance SPAC, (ii) the Placement Warrants may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis, (iii) the shares of SPAC Common Stock issued as part of the placement units, together with the Placement Warrants, are entitled to certain registration rights, and (iv) for so long as they are held by the Underwriter, the placement units will not be exercisable more than five years following the effective date of the registration statement filed by the Insurance SPAC in connection with the IPO. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the placement units (including the underlying Placement Warrants and SPAC Common Stock and the shares of SPAC Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Placement Warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We have agreed to lend the Insurance SPAC $750 for operating and acquisition related expenses. No amounts have been lent to date under this facility.\nOther income decreased by $165 to $583 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $748 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nImmediately prior to the effectiveness of the SPA, Cohen & Company Inc. owned 67.8% of the outstanding units of membership interests of the Operating LLC. Immediately subsequent to the effectiveness of the SPA, Cohen & Company Inc. owned 28.75% of the outstanding units of membership interests of the Operating LLC. As part of the SPA, Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust agreed to grant to Cohen & Company Inc. a proxy to vote, at any meeting of the Operating LLC, the number of the units of membership interests owned by Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust so that Cohen & Company Inc. would have 51.00% of the total votes eligible to vote at such meeting (the SPA Proxy\u201d). The actual units of membership interests that are subject to this proxy are determined at any meeting of the Operating LLC that a vote is held as follows: First, the total number of units of membership interests entitled to vote is determined. Second, the total number of units of membership interests entitled to vote is multiplied by 51.00% and the total units of membership interests held by Cohen & Company Inc. is subtracted from this amount. The result represents the total number of units of membership interests owned by Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust which will be subject to the SPA Proxy and that Cohen & Company Inc. will be entitled to vote. The number of units of membership interests subject to the proxy is allocated between Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust on a pro rata allocation.\nEach time a cash dividend was declared by our board of directors, a pro rata distribution was made to the other members of the Operating LLC upon payment of dividends to our stockholders.\nA portion of our revenue is generated from management fees. Our ability to charge management fees and the amount of those fees is dependent upon the underlying investment performance and stability of the Investment Vehicles. If these types of investments do not provide attractive returns to investors, the demand for such instruments will likely fall, thereby reducing our opportunity to earn\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe can potentially become involved with a VIE in three main ways:\n\ufeff\nThe following table presents our period end balance, average monthly balance, and maximum balance at any month end for receivables under resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\n2018 Cash Flows\nNet Income / (Loss) Attributable to the Non-controlling Interest\n\ufeff\nWe do not utilize hedge accounting for our derivatives. Accordingly, all derivatives are carried at fair value with unrealized and realized gains recognized in earnings.\n\ufeff\nOn December 30, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SPA\u201d) with Daniel G. Cohen and the DGC Trust. In connection with the SPA, we purchased an aggregate of 662,361 shares of International Money Express, Inc. ( IMXI\u201d), an\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 New issue and advisory revenue comprised of (a) new issue revenue associated with originating, arranging, or placing newly created financial instruments; and (b) revenue from advisory services. \nOther income decreased by $4,838 to $748 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $5,586 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNew Issue and Advisory Revenue\n \u00b7 Gains and losses (unrealized and realized) and income and expense earned on securities classified as other investments, at fair value. \n\ufeff\n (1) Other Investment Vehicles include any Investment Vehicle that is not a Company sponsored CDO. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nEquity securities represented unrestricted and restricted equity investments in publicly traded corporations See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about how we determine the value of these instruments.\nOur new issue and advisory revenue has been, and we expect it will continue to be, volatile. We earn revenue from a limited number of engagements. Therefore, a small change in the number of engagements can result in large fluctuations in the revenue recognized. Further, even if the number of engagements remains consistent, the average revenue per engagement can fluctuate considerably. Finally, our revenue is generally earned when an underlying transaction closes (rather than on a monthly or quarterly basis). Therefore, the timing of underlying transactions increases the volatility of our revenue recognition.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements including ongoing commitments to repay debt borrowings, make interest payments on outstanding borrowings, fund investments, and support other general business purposes. In addition, our U.S., European, and United Kingdom broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to certain regulatory requirements to maintain minimum levels of net capital. Historically, our primary sources of funds have been our operating activities and general corporate borrowings. In addition, our trading operations have generally been financed by the use of collateralized securities financing arrangements as well as margin loans. In recent years, we have engaged in a number of capital raising transactions with Daniel G. Cohen, Chairman of the Board and President and Chief Executive of European operations, and/or persons or entities controlled by or close to Mr. Cohen because the terms of such transactions have been more favorable than terms available from unrelated third parties. Our ability to fund losses or expand our business operations on favorable terms in the future may depend on our continued ability to raise capital from Mr. Cohen and/or such persons and entities.\n\ufeff\nOperating Expenses\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 During 2019: \n\ufeff\nWe generate our revenue by business segment primarily through the following activities.\nAs a general rule, our trading business benefits from increased market volatility. Increased volatility usually results in increased activity from our clients and counterparties. However, periods of extreme volatility may at times result in clients reducing their trading volumes, which would negatively impact our results. Also, periods of extreme volatility may result in large fluctuations in securities valuations and we may incur losses on our holdings. Also, our mortgage group's business benefits when mortgage volumes increase, and may suffer when mortgage volumes decrease. Among other things, mortgage volumes are significantly impacted by changes in interest rates.\nSPAC equity positions represents unrestricted equity investments in publicly traded SPACs. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about how we determine the value of these instruments\nFinancial instruments carried at contract amounts with short-term maturities (one year or less) are repriced frequently or bear market interest rates. Accordingly, those contracts are carried at amounts approximating fair value. Financial instruments carried at contract amounts on our consolidated balance sheets include receivables from and payables to brokers, securities purchased under agreements to resell ( reverse repurchase agreements\u201d or receivables under resale agreements\u201d), and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase ( repurchase agreements\u201d).\n (2) In some cases, accounts we manage employ leverage. In some cases, our fees are based on gross assets while in other cases our fees are based on net assets. AUM included herein is calculated using either the gross or net assets of each Investment Vehicle based on whichever serves as the basis for calculation of our management fees. \nCash compensation and benefits in the table above is primarily comprised of salary, incentive compensation, and benefits. Cash compensation and benefits increased by $466 to $25,228 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $24,762 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our headcount increased to 94 as of December 31, 2019 from 88 as of December 31, 2018. Cash compensation increased primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation related to the increase in net trading revenue.\n\ufeff\n o We amended the previously outstanding 2013 Convertible Notes, extending the maturity date from September 25, 2019 to September 25, 2020, increasing the interest rate from 8% to 12%, and removing the conversion feature. The post amendment notes are referred to as the 2019 Senior Notes. \n (4) To fund mergers or acquisitions. We may opportunistically use capital to acquire other asset managers, individual asset management contracts, or financial services firms. To the extent our liquidity sources are insufficient to fund our future merger \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the valuation hierarchy. In such cases, the level of the valuation hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\n\nCDOs\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe cash used in financing activities of $3,722 was comprised of (a) $1,461 of cash used to repay a portion of the 2013 Convertible Notes (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); (b) $525 of payment of debt issuance costs; (c) $75 of cash used to net settle equity awards; (d) $769 of cash used to repurchase and retire Common Stock; (e) $426 of distributions to the non-controlling interests of the Operating LLC; (f) $966 of dividends to our stockholders. partially offset by (g) $500 of cash proceeds from redeemable financial instruments (see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\ufeff\nIn 2018, we formed a new subsidiary, ViaNova, for the purpose of building a RTL business. RTLs are small balance commercial loans secured by first lien mortgages used by professional investors and real estate developers to finance the purchase and rehabilitation of residential properties. ViaNova's business plan includes buying, aggregating, and distributing these loans to produce superior risk-adjusted returns through the pursuit of opportunities overlooked by commercial banks. To that end, we have hired four professionals and entered into a line of credit with LegacyTexas Bank. See notes 4, 19, and 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nAsset management fees for broadly syndicated loans - Europe consist of a single CLO. Fees declined primarily due to a decline in subordinated asset management fees. During 2018, the performance of the portfolio deteriorated and certain cash flow diversion features of the CLO were triggered. As a result, cash flow that would otherwise pay subordinated management fees was diverted to pay principal on the senior securities. In addition, fees declined because of a reduction in AUM due to principal payments received.\n\ufeff\nAll amounts in this disclosure are in thousands (except share, unit, per share, and per unit data) except where otherwise noted.\n\ufeff\nOperating Expenses\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\ufeff\nThe insurance company debt that will be acquired by the U.S. Insurance JV may be originated by JVB and there may be origination fees earned in connection with such transactions. We also earn management fees as manager of the U.S. Insurance JV. We are entitled to a quarterly base management fee, an annual incentive fee (if certain return hurdles are met), and an additional incentive fee upon the liquidation of the portfolio (if certain return hurdles are met). See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nRiskless trades are transacted through our proprietary account with a customer order in hand, resulting in little or no market risk to us. Transactions that settle in the regular way are recognized on a trade date basis. Extended settlement transactions are recognized on a settlement date basis (although in cases of extended settlement trades, the unsettled trade is accounted for as a derivative between trade and settlement date). See notes 3 and 10. The investments classified as trading are carried at fair value. The determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices of an active exchange, independent broker market quotations, market price quotations from third-party pricing services or, when independent broker quotations or market price quotations from third-party pricing services are unavailable, valuation models prepared by our management. The models include estimates, and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange. See note 9.\n o The Sponsor Entities raised $2,550 from equity investors, which is recorded as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. \n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have the following sources of financing, which we account for as redeemable financial instruments. See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\ufeff\nThe cash used by operating activities of $15,463 was comprised of (a) net cash outflows of $32,007 related to working capital fluctuations; (b) net cash inflows of $19,458 from trading activities comprised of our investments-trading, trading securities sold, not yet purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, receivables under resale agreements, and receivables and payables from brokers, dealers, and clearing agencies, as well as the changes in unrealized gains and losses on the investments-trading and trading securities sold, not yet purchased; and (c) net cash outflows from other earnings items of $2,914 (which represents net income or loss adjusted for the following non-cash operating items: other income / (expense), realized and unrealized gains and losses on other investments, income / (loss) from equity method affiliates, equity based compensation, depreciation, and amortization).\n \u00b7 During the third quarter of 2018, we purchased 17,555 shares of Common Stock for $176 or $10.00 per share from a current member of the board of directors. \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in this ASU require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial\n \u00b7 During the fourth quarter of 2017, we purchased 11,177 shares of Common Stock from an unrelated third-party in a privately negotiated transaction for an aggregate purchase price of $112 or $10.00 per share. \nnew management fees or maintain existing management fees. As of December 31, 2019, 79.7% of our existing AUM were CDOs. The creation of CDOs has depended upon a vibrant securitization market. Since 2008, volumes within the securitization market have dropped significantly and have not fully recovered since that time. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. The remaining portion of our AUM is from a diversified mix of other Investment Vehicles most of which were more recently formed.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nInsurance Acquisition Corporation (the Insurance SPAC\u201d)\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations below.\nIn recent years, our mortgage group has grown in significance to our Capital Markets segment and our company overall. The mortgage group primarily earns revenue by providing hedging execution, securities financing, and trade execution services to mortgage originators and other investors in mortgage backed securities. Therefore, this group's revenue is highly dependent on the volume of mortgage originations in the U.S. Origination activity is highly sensitive to interest rates, the U.S. job market, housing starts, sale activity of existing housing stock, as well as the general health of the U.S. economy. In addition, any new regulation that impacts U.S. government agency mortgage backed security issuance activity, residential mortgage underwriting standards, or otherwise impacts mortgage originators will impact our business. We have no control over these external factors and there is no effective way for us to hedge against these risks. Our mortgage group's volumes and profitability will be highly impacted by these external factors.\n o We repaid $1,461 of the 2013 Convertible Notes and extended the maturity of the remaining $6,786 outstanding 2013 Convertible Notes from September 25, 2018 to September 25, 2019. \nOur business in general and our Capital Markets business segment in particular, do not produce predictable earnings. Our results can vary dramatically from year to year and quarter to quarter.\n\ufeff\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had the following other significant financing transactions. See notes 19 and 20 in our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nBusiness development, occupancy, and equipment increased by $407, or 14%, to $3,402 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $2,995 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was comprised of an increase in business development of $148 and an increase in occupancy and equipment of $259. Occupancy and equipment increased primarily due to our entry into a new office lease for office space in New York City, which commenced in August 2018.\n\ufeff\nOther\n\ufeff\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were $14,106, representing a decrease of $8,827 from December 31, 2017. The decrease was attributable to the cash used by operating activities of $6,999, the cash provided by investing activities of $2,156, the cash used in financing activities of $3,722, and the decrease in cash resulting from a change in exchange rates of $262.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe cash used by operating activities of $6,999 was comprised of (a) net cash outflows of $2,896 related to working capital fluctuations; (b) net cash inflows of $2,219 from trading activities comprised of our investments-trading, trading securities sold, not yet purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, receivables from resale agreements, and receivables and payables from brokers, dealers, and clearing agencies, as well as the changes in unrealized gains and losses on the investments-trading and trading securities sold, not yet purchased; and (c) net cash outflows from other earnings items of $6,322 (which represents net income or loss adjusted for the following non-cash operating items: other income / (expense), realized and unrealized gains and losses on other investments, equity based compensation, depreciation, and amortization).\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nSecurities Financing\nOur currency hedge consisted of a Euro forward agreement designed to hedge the currency risk primarily associated with our investment in EuroDekania. We terminated this hedge during 2019 and do not expect to enter into this hedge going forward.\nOther Income\nOur calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations used by other asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. This definition of AUM is not necessarily identical to the definitions of AUM that may be used in our management agreements.\nThe incentive management fee is an additional payment, made typically after five to seven years of the life of a CDO, which is based on the clearance of an accumulated cash return on investment ( Hurdle Return\u201d) received by the most junior CDO securities holders. It is an incentive for us to perform in our role as asset manager by minimizing defaults and maximizing recoveries. The incentive management fee is not ultimately determined or payable until the achievement of the Hurdle Return by the most junior CDO securities holders. We recognize incentive fee revenue when it is probable and there is not a significant chance of reversal in the future.\n \u00b7 The IIFC revenue share arrangement expires at the earlier of (i) the dissolution of IIFC or (ii) when we have earned a cumulative $20,000 in revenue share payments. Through December 31, 2018, we had earned $2,185 in the aggregate. Also, in any particular year, the revenue share earned by us cannot exceed $2,000. \nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction Between Topic 808 and Topic 606. The ASU also provides more comparability in the presentation of revenue for certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants. It accomplishes this by allowing organizations to only present units of account in collaborative arrangements that are within the scope of the revenue recognition standard together with revenue accounted for under the revenue recognition standard. The parts of the collaborative arrangement that are not in the scope of the revenue recognition standard should be presented separately from revenue accounted for under the revenue recognition. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nSee the statements of cash flows in our consolidated financial statements. We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, as well as our investment in our trading portfolio and related borrowing capacity, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the cash needs of our ongoing operations in the near term.\nAs of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, we maintained cash and cash equivalents of $8,304 and $14,106, respectively. We generated cash from or used cash for the activities described below.\nWe have three subsidiaries that are licensed securities dealers: JVB in the U.S., CCFL in the United Kingdom, and CCFEL in Ireland. As a U.S. broker-dealer, JVB is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule in Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. Our London-based subsidiary, CCFL, is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of the FCA and our Ireland-based subsidiary, CCFEL, is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of the CBI. The amount of net assets that these subsidiaries may distribute is subject to restrictions under these applicable net capital rules. These subsidiaries have historically operated in excess of minimum net capital requirements. Our minimum capital requirements at December 31, 2019 were as follows.\nA portion of our revenue is generated from new issue and advisory engagements. The fees charged and volume of these engagements are sensitive to the overall business environment. We provide investment banking and advisory services in Europe primarily through our subsidiary CCFEL and new issue services in the U.S. through our subsidiary JVB. Currently, our primary source of new issue revenue is from originating assets for our U.S. insurance asset management business and the PriDe funds and managed accounts.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe cash provided in financing activities of $23,118 was comprised of (a) $11,000 in proceeds from the issuance of the redeemable financial instrument (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); (b) $15,000 in proceeds from issuance of the 2017 Convertible Note (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); partially offset by (c) $800 in cash used to pay issuance and financing costs; (d) $100 in cash used to net settle equity awards; (e) $572 in repurchases of our Common Stock; (f) $985 of dividends to our stockholders; and (g) $425 of distributions to the non-controlling interests of the Operating LLC.\nIf the Insurance SPAC fails to consummate a Business Combination within the first 18 months following the IPO, its corporate existence will cease except for the purposes of winding up its affairs and liquidating its assets.\nOur business is materially affected by economic conditions in the financial markets, political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, the housing and mortgage markets, changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions, and changes in interest rates, including overnight funding rates, all of which can affect our profitability and are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors and companies, including their level of participation in the financial markets and their willingness to participate in corporate transactions. Severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce our trading volume and revenues, negatively affect our ability to generate new issue and advisory revenue, and adversely affect our profitability.\nCash Flows\nWe operate with more than the minimum regulatory capital requirement in our licensed broker-dealers and at December 31, 2019 total net capital, or the equivalent as defined by the relevant statutory regulations, in our licensed broker-dealers totaled $61,610. See note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, our licensed broker-dealers are generally subject to capital withdrawal notification and restrictions.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\n\ufeff\nThe Sponsor Entities collectively hold 5,103,333 founder shares of the Insurance SPAC. Subject to certain limited exceptions, placement units held by the Sponsor Entities will not be transferable or salable until 30 days following a Business Combination, and founder shares held by the Sponsor Entities will not be transferable or salable except (a) with respect to 20% of such shares, until consummation of a Business Combination, and (b) with respect to additional 20% tranches of such shares, when the closing price of the SPAC common stock exceeds $12.00, $13.50, $15.00, and $17.00, respectively, for 20 out of any 30 consecutive trading days following the consummation of a Business Combination, in each case subject to certain limited exceptions.\nIn the case of Investment Vehicles other than CDOs, generally we earn a base fee and, in some cases, also earns an incentive fee. Base fees will generally be recognized monthly as services are performed and will be paid monthly or quarterly. The contractual terms of each arrangement will determine our revenue recognition policy for incentive fees in each case. However, in all cases, we recognize the incentive fees when they are probable and there is not a significant chance of reversal in the future.\nAsset management fees increased by $4,639, or 59%, to $12,536 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $7,897 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as discussed in more detail below.\nPrincipal transactions and other income\n\ufeff\nAsset management fees decreased by $4,976, or 40%, to $7,560 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $12,536 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as discussed in more detail below.\nThe senior asset management fee is generally senior to all the securities in the CDO capital structure and is recognized on a monthly basis as services are performed. The senior asset management fee is generally paid on a quarterly basis.\n\ufeff\nU.S. Housing Market\nThe cash used by operating activities of $11,916 was comprised of (a) net cash inflows of $3,659 related to working capital fluctuations; (b) net cash outflows of $18,224 from trading activities comprised of our investments-trading, trading securities sold, not yet purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, receivables from resales agreements, and receivables and payables from brokers, dealers, and clearing agencies, as well as the changes in unrealized gains and losses on the investments-trading and trading securities sold, not yet purchased; and (c) net cash inflows from other earnings items of $2,649 (which represents net income or loss adjusted for the following non-cash operating items: other income / (expense), realized and unrealized gains and losses on other investments, equity based compensation, depreciation, and amortization).\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Asset Management: Our Asset Management business segment manages assets within CDOs, managed accounts, joint ventures, and investment funds (collectively, Investment Vehicles\u201d). A CDO is a form of secured borrowing. The borrowing is secured by different types of fixed income assets such as corporate or mortgage loans or bonds. The borrowing is in the form of a securitization, which means that the lenders are actually investing in notes backed by the assets. In the event of default, the lenders will have recourse only to the assets securing the loan. Our Asset Management business segment includes our fee-based asset management operations, which include on-going base and incentive management fees. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2.76 billion in AUM of which 79.7%, or $2.20 billion, was in CDOs. A substantial portion of our asset management revenue is earned from the management of CDOs. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations. The remaining portion of our AUM is from a diversified mix of other Investment Vehicles that were more recently formed. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n2017 Cash Flows\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Our trading activities, which include execution and brokerage services, securities lending activities, riskless trading activities, as well as gains and losses (unrealized and realized) and income and expense earned on securities classified as trading; \nThe proceeds from the placement units were added to the net proceeds from the IPO to be held in a trust account. If the Insurance SPAC does not complete a Business Combination within the first 18 months following the IPO, the proceeds from the sale of the placement units will be used to fund the redemption of the SPAC Common Stock sold as part of the SPAC Units in the IPO (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Placement Warrants will expire worthless.\nHow we determine fair value for securities\n\ufeff\n\nAsset management revenue from Company-sponsored CDOs increased by $2,071 to $7,919 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $5,848 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the periods presented by asset class.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n (5) Represents material operating contracts for various services. \nIn October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Target Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities. The ASU made targeted changes to the related party consolidation guidance. The new guidance changes how entities evaluate decision-making fees under the variable interest entity guidance. To determine whether decision-making fees represent a variable interest, an entity will need to consider indirect interests held through related parties under common control on a proportionate basis under the new guidance, rather than in their entirety, as has been the case under current guidance. The guidance is effective in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nNew issue and advisory revenue decreased by $3,361, or 53%, to $2,979 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $6,340 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nRevenues increased by $280, or 1%, to $49,666 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $49,386 for the year ended December 31, 2018. As discussed in more detail below, the change was comprised of (i) an increase of $8,874 in net trading revenue; (ii) a decrease of $4,976 in asset management revenue; (iii) a decrease of $1,148 in new issue and advisory revenue; and (iv) a decrease of $2,470 in principal transactions and other income.\n\ufeff\nThe subordinated asset management fee is an additional payment for the same services but has a lower priority in the CDO cash flows. If the CDO experiences a certain level of asset defaults and deferrals, these fees may not be paid. There is no recovery by the CDO of previously paid subordinated asset management fees. It is our policy to recognize these fees on a monthly basis as services are performed. The subordinated asset management fee is generally paid on a quarterly basis. However, if we determine that the subordinated asset management fee will not be paid (which generally occurs on the quarterly payment date), we will stop recognizing additional subordinated asset management fees on that particular CDO and will reverse any subordinated asset management fees that are accrued and unpaid. We will begin accruing the subordinated asset management fee again if payment resumes and, in management's estimate, continued payment is reasonably assured. If payment were to resume but we were unsure of continued payment, we would recognize the subordinated asset management fee as payments were received and would not accrue such fees on a monthly basis.\nAn event of default under the clearing agreement would give the counterparty the option to terminate the clearing arrangement. Any amounts owed to the clearing broker would be immediately due and payable. These obligations are recourse to us. Furthermore, a termination of any of our clearing arrangements would result in a significant disruption to our business and would have a significant negative impact on our dealings and relationship with our customers.\nAll of the securities we own that are classified as investments-trading, securities sold, not yet purchased, or other investments, at fair value are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value (both unrealized and realized) recorded in earnings.\n\ufeff\nViaNova\nIn June 2018, in response to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, we formed a new subsidiary, CCFEL in Ireland, for the purpose of seeking to become regulated to perform asset management and capital markets activities in Ireland and the European Union. In April 2019, CCFEL received authorization from the CBI under the European Union (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2017 to provide investment services in respect of certain financial instruments including transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and various option, futures, swaps, forward rate agreements and other derivative contracts ( Financial Instruments\u201d). The services for which CCFEL received authorization include the receipt and transmission of orders in relation to Financial Instruments, the execution of orders on behalf of clients, portfolio management, investment advice and investment research, and financial analysis. In addition, CCFEL applied for approval of a French branch, which approval was granted by the CBI and the branch was authorized by the French regulators in April 2019. Following authorization of the French Branch of CCFEL, various contracts originally entered into by CCFL were novated to the French Branch of CCFEL. The novation of contracts was completed on July 1, 2019.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nName Change; Common Stock Reverse Stock Split\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $57, or 22%, to $318 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $261 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was the result of additional leasehold improvements during 2019.\nSubscriptions, Clearing, and Execution\n\ufeff\nThe U.S. Insurance JV is a company that invests in debt issued by insurance companies and we carry our investment at its NAV. Income recognized in each period is the result of changes in the underlying NAV of the fund as well as distributions received. See notes 4 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n\nA portion of our revenue is generated from net trading activity. We engage in proprietary trading for our own account, provide securities financing for our customers, and execute riskless\u201d trades with a customer order in hand resulting in limited market risk to us. The inventory of securities held for our own account, as well as held to facilitate customer trades, and our market making activities are sensitive to market movements.\n\ufeff\nHow we determine fair value for investments in investment funds and similar vehicles\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nSince March 17, 2016, we entered into two letter agreements (together, the 10b5-1 Plan\u201d) with Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. (the Agent\u201d). The most recent letter agreement provided for the Agent to purchase up to an aggregate maximum of $2,000 of Common Stock and was in effect until March 19, 2019. It expired on that date and we did not enter into a new letter agreement. Pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan, purchases of Common Stock may have been made in public and private transactions and were required to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The 10b5-1 Plan was designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\nPrincipal transactions and other income decreased by $1,823 to $4,573 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $6,396 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nSee notes 19 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nFor each investment made within the principal investing portfolio, we assess whether the investee is a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. If we determine the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, we will consolidate it.\nDebt Financing\nOther than as described in note 10 (derivative financial instruments) and note 18 (variable interest entities) to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there were no material off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet Trading\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Asset management fees for our on-going asset management services provided to certain Investment Vehicles, which may include fees both senior and subordinate to the securities issued by the Investment Vehicle; and \n\ufeff\n (1) Non-controlling interest is recorded on a monthly basis. Because earnings are recognized unevenly throughout the year and the non-controlling interest percentage may change during the period, the average effective non-controlling interest percentage may not equal the percentage at the end of any period or the simple average of the beginning and ending percentages. The non-controlling interest percentage changed to 72.25% effective December 30, 2019. This change did not have a significant impact the average for the year ended December 31, 2019, but we expect it to have a much greater impact going forward. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe try to address these challenges by (i) focusing our business on clients and asset classes that are underserved by the large firms, (ii) continuing to monitor our fixed costs to enhance operating leverage and limit our losses during periods of low volumes, and (iii) attempting to hire and retain entrepreneurial and effective traders and salespeople.\n\ufeff\nWe are the sponsor of the Insurance SPAC, a blank check company seeking to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses (each a Business Combination\u201d).\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCertain subsidiaries of the Operating LLC have restrictions on the withdrawal of capital and otherwise in making distributions and loans. JVB is subject to net capital restrictions imposed by the SEC and FINRA that require certain minimum levels of net capital to remain in this subsidiary. In addition, these restrictions could potentially impose notice requirements or limit our ability to withdraw capital above the required minimum amounts (excess capital) whether through a distribution or a loan. CCFL is regulated by the\n\n\ufeff\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including fair value of financial instruments. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n \u00b7 The Alesco X-XVII revenue share arrangement expired in February 2017. Included in the revenue share revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1,579 of contingent amounts that became due upon the conclusion of the arrangement. No additional revenue will be earned from this arrangement. \n\ufeff\nOur net trading revenue includes unrealized gains on our trading investments, as of the applicable measurement date that may never be realized due to changes in market or other conditions not in our control. This may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from these investments. In addition, our net trading revenue also includes realized gains on certain proprietary trading positions. Our ability to derive trading gains from such trading positions is subject to overall market conditions. Due to volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, the net trading revenue recognized during the year may not be indicative of future results. Furthermore, from time to time, some of the assets included in the Investments-trading line of our consolidated balance sheets represent level 3 valuations within the FASB valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets are carried at fair value based on estimates derived using internal valuation models and other estimates. See notes 9 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The fair value estimates made by us may not be indicative of the final sale price at which these assets may be sold.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOn August 2, 2019, our board of directors announced that we have decided to suspend our quarterly cash dividend. We currently intend to use the related annual cash savings to invest in new business initiatives and improve our financial position. Any future determination to declare and pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account a variety of factors, including business, financial, and regulatory considerations as well as any limitations under Maryland law or imposed by any agreements governing our indebtedness. Going forward, the board of directors will re-assess our capital resources and may or may not determine to reinstate the dividend based on that assessment.\nThe determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices of an active exchange, independent broker market quotations, market price quotations from third-party pricing services, or, when independent broker quotations or market price quotations from third-party pricing services are unavailable, valuation models prepared by management. These models include estimates and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIn May 2018, we committed to invest up to $3,000 in a newly formed joint venture (the U.S. Insurance JV\u201d) with an outside investor that committed to invest approximately $63,000 of equity in the U.S. Insurance JV. The U.S. Insurance JV was formed for the purposes of investing in debt issued by small and medium sized U.S. and Bermuda insurance and reinsurance companies and is managed by Dekania Capital Management, LLC, a registered investment adviser subsidiary of the Company ( DCM\u201d). We are required to invest 4.5% of the total equity of the U.S. Insurance JV with an absolute limit of $3,000. The U.S. Insurance JV may use leverage to grow its assets. As of December 31, 2019, we had invested $2,642.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe U.S. Insurance JV is an investment company and we carry our investment at the NAV of the fund. Income recognized in each period is the result of changes in the underlying NAV of the fund as well as distributions received. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes our long-term indebtedness and other financing outstanding. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\n (3) The junior subordinated notes listed represent debt the Company owes to the two trusts noted above. The total par amount owed by the Company to the trusts is $49,614. However, the Company owns the common stock of the trusts in a total par amount of $1,489. The Company pays interest (and at maturity, principal) to the trusts on the entire $49,614 junior notes outstanding. However, the Company receives back from the trusts the pro rata share of interest and principal on the common stock held by the Company. These trusts are variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) and the Company does not consolidate them even though the Company holds the common stock. The Company carries the common stock on its balance sheet at a value of $0. The junior subordinated notes are recorded at a discount to par. When factoring in the discount, the yield to maturity of the junior subordinated notes as of December 31, 2019 on a combined basis is 15.04% assuming the variable rate in effect on the last day of the reporting period remains in effect until maturity. \nDepreciation and amortization increased by $12, or 5%, to $261 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $249 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe revenue share arrangements noted in the table above entitle us to either a percentage of revenue earned by certain entities or a percentage of revenue earned above certain thresholds. See discussion of revenue share arrangements in Item 1 - Business\u201d beginning on page 5. These arrangements expire, or have expired, as follows:", "item_7_text": "\ufeff\n o We began periodic draws on the LegacyTexas Credit Facility of which $4,777 remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019. \nAsset Management\n \u00b7 Capital Markets: Our Capital Markets business segment consists primarily of fixed income sales, trading, matched book repo financing, new issue placements in corporate and securitized products, and advisory services. Our fixed income sales and trading group provides trade execution to corporate investors, institutional investors, mortgage originators, and other smaller broker-dealers. We specialize in a variety of products, including but not limited to: corporate bonds, ABS, MBS, RMBS, CDOs, CLOs, CBOs, CMOs, municipal securities, TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts, SBA loans, U.S. government bonds, U.S. government agency securities, brokered deposits and CDs for small banks, and hybrid capital of financial institutions including TruPS, whole loans, and other structured financial instruments. We also offer execution and brokerage services for equity products. We carry out our capital markets activities primarily through our subsidiaries: JVB in the U.S. and CCFL and CCFEL in Europe. \n\ufeff\nMargin Pressures in Fixed Income Brokerage Business\nIncome Tax Expense / (Benefit)\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNet Income / (Loss) Attributable to the Non-controlling Interest\n\ufeff\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAsset management revenue consists of management fees earned from Investment Vehicles. In the case of CDOs, the fees earned by us generally consist of senior, subordinated, and incentive fees.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur revenue earned from new issue and advisory has been, and we expect will continue to be, volatile. We earn revenue from a limited number of engagements. Therefore, a small change in the number of engagements can result in large fluctuations in the revenue recognized. Further, even if the number of engagements remains consistent, the average revenue per engagement can fluctuate considerably. Finally, our revenue is generally earned when an underlying transaction closes (rather than on a monthly or quarterly basis). Therefore, the timing of underlying transactions increases the volatility of our revenue recognition.\nOther Income\nCash compensation and benefits in the table above is primarily comprised of salary, incentive compensation, and benefits. Cash compensation and benefits increased by $2,967 to $24,762 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $21,795 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our headcount remained the same at 88 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Cash compensation increased primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation related to increases in net trading and asset management revenues.\nOverview\n\ufeff\nThe SPAC Funds are investment companies and we carry our investment at the NAV of the funds. Income recognized in each period is a result of changes in the underlying NAV of the SPAC Funds as well as distributions received. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA portion of our other investments, at fair value represents investments in investment funds and other non-publicly traded entities that have the attributes of investment companies as described in ASC 946-15-2. We estimate the fair value of these entities using the reported net asset value per share as of the reporting date in accordance with the practical expedient\u201d provisions related to investments in certain entities that calculated net asset value per share (or its equivalent) included in ASC 820.\nTBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell mortgage-backed securities whose collateral remain to be announced\u201d until just prior to the trade settlement. In addition to TBAs, we sometimes enter into forward purchases or sales of agency mortgage-backed securities where the underlying collateral has been identified. These transactions are referred to as other forward agency MBS contracts. We account for TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts as derivatives.\nRevenues\nA substantial portion of our asset management fees are earned from the management of CDOs. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations. The remaining portion of our AUM is from a diversified mix of other Investment Vehicles most of which were more recently formed.\nOur voting-controlled subsidiary, the Operating LLC, is treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in most of the states in which we do business. The Operating LLC is subject to entity level taxes in certain state and foreign jurisdictions. However, as a result of the Merger, we acquired significant deferred tax assets and liabilities and now have significant tax attributes. Effective as of January 1, 2010, we began to be treated as a C corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nunrelated publicly traded company, from Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust. Of the 662,361 shares, 134,317 shares were unrestricted and 528,044 are subject to sale restrictions. Of the 528,044 restricted shares, 246,021 shares become freely tradeable if IMXI's share price equals or exceeds $15.00 per share for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days or upon a change of control of IMXI, and 264,023 shares become freely tradeable if IMXI's share price equals or exceed $17.00 per share 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days or upon a change of control of IMXI. IMXI's share price closed at $11.89 per share on December 31, 2019. In exchange for the IMXI shares, the Operating LLC issued an aggregate of 22,429,273 newly issued units of membership interests in the Operating LLC to Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust. These membership interests represent an equity interest in the Operating LLC. Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, units of membership interests in the Operating LLC are redeemable and, if redeemed, Cohen & Company Inc. can determine to have the Operating LLC pay cash in exchange for the membership interests or Cohen & Company Inc. may instead issue additional Common Shares on a 1 for 10 basis in exchange for the membership interests. Therefore, the membership interests in the Operating LLC issued in connection with the SPA may be convertible into an aggregate of up to 2,242,927 Common Shares (subject to certain restrictions set forth in the SPA). We obtained a third-party valuation of the IMXI shares and determined the value of these shares upon closing of the SPA was $7,779. We recorded this transaction as an increase in other investments, at fair value of $7,779 and an increase in non-controlling interest of $7,779 in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the SPA, Cohen & Company Inc. issued an aggregate of 22,429,541 newly issued shares Series F Preferred Stock to Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust. Our Series F Preferred Stock have no economic rights and entitle the holders thereof to vote together with holders of our Common Stock on all matters presented to the such common stockholders, with each holder of Series F Preferred Stock being entitled to one vote for every ten preferred shares held (i.e., the Series F Preferred Stock issued in connection with the SPA entitle the holder to 2,242,927 votes). The Series F Preferred Stock do not participate in earnings or dividends.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 The Star Asia revenue share arrangement terminated during 2018. We earned a large incentive payment from Star Asia in the year ended December 31, 2017. \n\ufeff\nSee notes 19 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\ufeff\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nEquity-based compensation increased by $121 to $744 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $623 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was a result of a higher level of grants in 2019 as compared to 2018. See note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n \u00b7 During the second quarter of 2017, we purchased 2,774 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $33 or $12.00 per share from an employee of the Company. \nThe cash used by investing activities of $3,896 was comprised of (a) $7,155 of cash used to purchase other investments, at fair value; (b) $143 of cash used to purchase furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements; partially offset by (c) $3,402 of cash provided by sales and returns of principal of other investments, at fair value.\nOperating expenses decreased by $102, or 0%, to $45,625 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $45,727 for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The following table shows the detail by trading group.\nThe original maturity date of the 2013 Convertible Notes was September 25, 2018. Immediately prior to maturity, the 2013 Convertible Notes were held by three parties. On September 25, 2018, we fully paid off one holder in the amount of $1,461. We entered into amendments with the holders of the remaining $6,786 aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Convertible Notes: the Edward E. Cohen IRA and the EBC 2013 Family Trust. Edward E. Cohen is the benefactor of the Edward E. Cohen IRA and is the father of Daniel G.

See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset Management\nOur accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results in our consolidated financial statements. Our industry is subject to a number of highly complex accounting rules and requirements many of which place heavy burdens on management to make judgments relating to our business. We encourage readers of this Form 10-K to read all of our critical accounting policies, which are included in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a full understanding of these issues and how the financial statements are impacted by these judgments. Certain of these policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and\n\ufeff\nWe have seven primary uses for capital:\n (2) The holder of the 2017 Convertible Note may convert all or any part of the outstanding principal amount at any time prior to maturity into units of the Operating LLC at a conversion price of $1.45 per unit, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Units of the membership interests of Operating LLC not held by Cohen & Company Inc. may, with certain restrictions, be redeemed and exchanged into shares of Common Stock on a ten-for-one basis. Therefore, the 2017 Convertible Note can be converted into Operating LLC units of membership interests and then redeemed and exchanged into Common Stock at an effective conversion price of $14.50. \nRevenue Recognition\nPrincipal Transactions and Other Income\n \u00b7 During the fourth quarter of 2017, we purchased 27,346 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $273 or $10.00 per share from a former member of the board of directors, who was a director at the time of purchase. \n o Effective October 1, 2019, the DGC Trust / CBF redeemable financial instruments were amended and restated. The definition of Investment Return (as defined in the agreements) was modified in both the DGC Trust and CBF agreements. The Investment Amount was reduced by $1,500 in the CBF agreement and the Company made a $1,500 one-time payment to CBF. \nIn addition, we often incur certain costs related to new issue engagements. These costs are included as a component of either subscriptions, clearing and execution, or professional fees and other and will generally be recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized.\nCDOs\nProfessional Fee and Other Operating Expenses\nOur Principal Investing Portfolio\nOur CLO investments represented investments in the most junior tranche of certain CLOs. The average carrying value of our CLO investments for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11,384, as compared to $5,289 for the year ended December 31, 2017. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about how we determine the value of these instruments.\nFor each investment management contract, we enter into, we will assess whether the entity being managed is a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. If we determine the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, we will consolidate it.\n\ufeff\nThe table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. Our junior subordinated notes are assumed to be repaid on their respective maturity dates. Also, we have assumed that the 2017 Convertible Note is not converted prior to maturity. Excluded from the table are\nSee note 33 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of partial repayment of 2019 Senior Notes in 2020.\nContractual Obligations\nOur policy is to record penalties and interest as a component of provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\ufeff\nCompensation and Benefits\nIn addition to purchases made under the 10b5-1 plan, we made the following repurchases in privately negotiated transactions during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\n\ufeff\nPrincipal transactions include all gains, losses, and income (interest and dividend) from financial instruments classified as other investments, at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn 2018, asset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - Europe was impacted by the successful auction and liquidation of Dekania Europe 1. As a result of the successful auction, our deferred subordinated management fees were paid as well as other one-time fees associated with termination. The total revenue earned on this CDO was $434 and $592 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition to this decrease, we experienced a decline in revenues earned from the remaining CDOs primarily due to principal payments on the assets in these securitizations.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nProfessional fee and other operating expenses increased by $1,114, or 15%, to $8,459 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $7,345 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was comprised of an increase of $1,140 in professional fees; partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses of $26. Professional fees increased due to sub-advisory fees incurred in connection with the successful auction of the Alesco II CDO managed by DCM, as well as a finder's fee incurred in connection with new issue and advisory revenue earned by JVB for the origination of financial assets.\nAsset Management:\n\ufeff\nThe tax benefit recognized in 2018 was comprised of a current tax benefit of $3 and a deferred tax benefit of $838. The deferred tax benefit was a U.S. tax benefit which was the result of the net loss incurred by us in 2018. This net loss provides additional NOL carryforwards that can be recognized as a benefit to the extent such NOLs can scheduled against our deferred tax liability reversal.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework -Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The ASU modifies the disclosure requirements in Topic 820, by removing certain disclosure requirements related to the valuation hierarchy, modifying existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adding new disclosure requirements such as disclosing the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and disclosing the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nDerivatives involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk, whereby changes in the level or volatility of interest rates or market values of the underlying financial instruments may result in changes in the value of a particular financial instrument in excess of its carrying amount. Depending on our investment strategy, realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in principal transactions and other income or in net trading in our consolidated statements of operations on a trade date basis.\nUnrealized and realized gains and losses on securities classified as investments-trading in the consolidated balance sheets are recorded as a component of net trading revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on securities classified as other investments, at fair value, in the consolidated balance sheets are recorded as a component of principal transactions and other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nSubscriptions, clearing, and execution increased by $1,055, or 12%, to $9,682 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $8,627 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to increases of $326 in subscriptions and $729 in clearing and execution. The increase in clearing and execution was due to increased trading volume.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur Trading Portfolio\n\ufeff\n (2) The interest on the junior subordinated notes related to Alesco Capital Trust I is variable. The interest rate of 5.94% (based on a 90-day LIBOR rate in effect as of December 31, 2019 plus 4.00%) was used to compute the contractual interest payment in each period noted. The interest on the junior subordinated notes related to Sunset Financial Statutory Trust I is variable. The interest rate of 6.11% (based on a 90-day LIBOR rate in effect as of December 31, 2019 plus 4.15%) was used to compute the contractual interest payment in each period noted. \nCompensation and benefits increased by $587, or 2%, to $25,972 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $25,385 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAsset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - U.S. increased primarily because the Alesco II CDO successfully auctioned off its assets and liquidated. As a result of the successful auction, our deferred subordinated management fees were paid. As a result, we recorded revenue of $2,997 and related professional fees and other expense of $999 in 2018. The total revenue earned on this CDO was $3,211 and $304 for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We will no longer earn any revenue in the future from this securitization. Except as set forth above, asset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - U.S. declined as compared to 2017 because AUM declined primarily due to principal repayments on the assets of these securitizations.\nOur currency hedge consisted of a Euro forward agreement designed to hedge the currency risk primarily associated with our investment in EuroDekania.\n\ufeff\n or acquisition activities, we may need to raise additional funding through an equity or debt offering.

The average carrying value of our CLO investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2,662 as compared to $11,384 for the year ended December 31, 2018. These investments are carried at fair value. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about how we determine the value of these instruments.\nIn addition, we may hold, from time to time, trading securities sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated balance sheets that represent our obligations to deliver the specified security at the contracted price, thereby creating a liability to purchase the security in the market at prevailing prices. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities sold, not yet purchased are recorded as a component of net trading revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur clearing brokers provide securities financing arrangements including margin arrangements and securities borrowing and lending arrangements. These arrangements generally require us to transfer additional securities or cash to the clearing broker in the event the value of the securities then held by the clearing broker in the margin account falls below specified levels and contain events of default were we to breach our obligations under such agreements.\nOther Business and Transactions\nA portion of our revenues is generated from our principal investing activities. Therefore, our revenues are impacted by the overall market supply and demand of these investments as well as the individual performance of each investment. Our principal investments are included within other investments, at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u00b7 Principal Investing: Our Principal Investing business segment is comprised of investments that we have made for the purpose of earning an investment return rather than investments made to support our trading, matched book repo, or other Capital Markets business segment activities. These investments are a component of our other investments, at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. \nAsset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - Europe declined. In June 2018, the Dekania Europe I CDO had a successful auction of its assets and liquidated. During 2018, the Company recorded management fee revenue of $435 associated with the Dekania Europe I CDO. The remaining reduction in asset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - Europe was a result a decline in AUM due to principal repayments on the assets in these securitizations.\n\ufeff\nBusiness Development, Occupancy, and Equipment\n (4) Represents the interest rate in effect as of the last day of the reporting period. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 During 2017: \nin accordance with U.S. GAAP.

In those cases, the purchase or sale of the security or loan is not recorded until the settlement date. However, from the trade date until the settlement date, our interest in the security is accounted for as a derivative as either a forward purchase commitment or forward sale commitment.\nPrincipal Transactions\n\ufeff\nProfessional fee and other operating expenses decreased by $2,208, or 26%, to $6,251 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $8,459 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was due to decreases of $2,098 in professional fees and $110 in other operating expense. The professional fee decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in consulting costs related to new issue revenue incurred in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to less new issue revenue earned in 2019. In addition, in 2018, we incurred sub-advisory fees in connection with the successful auction of the Alesco II CDO managed by DCM. No CDOs were the subject of a successful auction during 2019.\nOperating expenses increased by $5,587, or 14%, to $45,727 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $40,140 for the year ended December 31, 2017. As discussed in more detail below, the change was comprised of (i) an increase of $2,858 in compensation and benefits; (ii) an increase of $272 in business development, occupancy, and equipment; (iii) an increase of $1,331 in subscriptions, clearing, and execution; (iv) an increase of $1,114 in professional fee and other operating; and (v) an increase of $12 in depreciation and amortization.\nFluctuations in the balance of our repurchase agreements from period to period and intraperiod are dependent on business activity in those periods. The fluctuations in the balances of our receivables under resale agreements over the periods presented were impacted by our clients' desires to execute collateralized financing arrangements through the repurchase market or other financing products.\n\ufeff\nOther asset management revenue decreased by $1,085 to $3,532 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $4,617 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower performance fees being earned on managed accounts in 2019 as compared 2018.\n \u00b7 During the fourth quarter of 2019, we purchased 1,000 shares of Common Stock for $5 or $4.50 per share from the Company's chief financial officer. \nInvestment in CK Capital Partners B.V. and AOI\n \ufeff Level 1 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. \ufeff Level 2 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on one or more of the following: (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; (c) pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or (d) pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \ufeff Level 3 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. These inputs reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. \nThe tax benefit recognized in 2019 was comprised of a deferred tax benefit of $678 partially offset by current tax expense of $155. The current tax expense incurred in 2019 was primarily the result of foreign income tax. The deferred tax benefit was a U.S. tax benefit, which was the result of the net loss incurred by us in 2019. This net loss provides additional net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards which can be recognized as a benefit to the extent such NOLs can scheduled against our deferred tax liability reversal.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n (1) Assumes the 2017 Convertible Note is not converted prior to maturity. \nIn August 2018, we invested in and became the general partner of a series of newly formed partnerships, the SPAC Funds, for the purposes of investing in the equity securities of SPACs. Cohen & Company Financial Management, LLC, a registered investment adviser subsidiary of the Company ( CCFM\u201d), is the manager of the SPAC Funds. As of December 31, 2019, we had invested $646 in the SPAC Funds. We are entitled to a quarterly base management fee based on a percentage of the net asset value of the SPAC Funds and an annual incentive allocation based on the actual returns earned by the SPAC Funds.

Beginning in 2012, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per quarter, which was paid regularly through the first quarter of 2019. Each time a cash dividend was declared by our board of directors, a pro rata distribution was made to the other members of the Operating LLC upon payment of dividends to our stockholders.\nAll of the repurchases noted above were completed using cash on hand.\nThe following is a list of recent accounting pronouncements that, we believe, will have a continuing impact on our financial statements going forward. For a more complete list of recent pronouncements, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe following section provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the specified periods.

If the derivative is a hedge for an investment carried as a component of other investments, at fair value, the derivative will be recorded in other investments, at fair value.\nAssets Under Management\nIf there were an event of default under a repurchase agreement, the counterparty would have the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and make any amount due from us to the counterparty payable immediately. Repurchase obligations are full recourse obligations to us. If we were to default under a repurchase obligation, the counterparty would have recourse to our other assets if the collateral was not sufficient to satisfy our obligations in full. Most of our repurchase agreements are entered into as part of our matched book repo business.\n\ufeff\n (4) The redeemable financial instruments require certain variable payments be made by us based on revenues earned by certain of our operations.

We generally grow our AUM by sponsoring new Investment Vehicles. The creation of a new Investment Vehicle often requires us to invest a certain amount of our own capital to attract outside capital to manage.

In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

These models include estimates, and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange.

The decrease was attributable to the cash used by operating activities of $15,463, the cash provided by investing activities of $3,734, the cash provided in financing activities of $5,936, and the decrease in cash resulting from a change in exchange rates of $9.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense, net\nSubscriptions, clearing, and execution increased by $1,331, or 18%, to $8,627 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $7,296 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was comprised of increases in subscriptions of $457 and clearing and execution of $874. The subscriptions increase was primarily the result of increases in Bloomberg licensing charges and new subscriptions to support the ViaNova business. The increase in clearing and execution was due to increased trading volume and a full year of operation in 2018 for our GCF matched repo business.\n\ufeff\nFinancial Conduct Authority ( FCA\u201d) and CCFEL is regulated by the CBI and both must maintain certain minimum levels of capital. See note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEquity-based compensation decreased by $109 to $623 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $732 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decline was the result of there being no restricted stock grants to the board of directors during 2018. There were grants to the board of directors during 2017. See note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe income tax expense / (benefit) was ($523) for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to ($841) for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n (5) To fund potential dividends and distributions. During the third quarter of 2010 and for each subsequent quarter through March 31, 2019, the board of directors declared a dividend. A pro rata distribution was paid to the other members of the Operating LLC upon the payment of any dividends to our stockholders. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 During 2018: \n o We amended and restructured the 2018 FT LOC and issued a new subordinated revolving note, the 2019 FT Revolver. We have not borrowed under the 2018 FT LOC or the 2019 FT LOC. \n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $22,933, representing an increase of $7,717 from December 31, 2016. The increase was attributable to the cash used by operating activities of $11,916, the cash used by investing activities of $3,896, the cash provided in financing activities of $23,118, and the increase in cash resulting from a change in exchange rates of $411.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Incentive management fees earned based on the performance of the certain Investment Vehicles. \nMargins and volumes in certain products and markets within the fixed income brokerage business continue to decrease materially as competition has increased and general market activity has declined. Further, we continue to expect that competition will increase over time, resulting in continued margin pressure.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nAs shown in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein, we currently have significant unrecognized deferred tax assets. These assets are unrecognized because we have recorded valuation allowances as we have determined that it is not more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these tax assets. However, this determination is ongoing and subject to change. If we were to change this determination in the future, a significant tax benefit would be recognized as a component of earnings.\n\ufeff\nNet trading revenue increased by $2,389, or 9%, to $29,298 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $26,909 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table shows the detail by trading group.\nEuroDekania was an investment company and we carried our investment at the NAV of the fund. Income recognized in each period was the result of changes in the underlying NAV of the fund as well as distributions received. Our investment in EuroDekania was denominated in Euros. We sometimes hedged this exposure (as described in greater detail below). EuroDekania was liquidated in 2019.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIMXI represents unrestricted and restricted equity positions of International Money Express, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMXI), a publicly traded company that resulted from the merger of Intermex Holdings, LLC and FinTech Acquisition Corp. II. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about how we determine the value of these instruments. Also see note 4 and 31 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn December 2019, we acquired a 45% interest in CK Capital Partners B.V. ( CK Capital\u201d), a private company incorporated in the Netherlands. CK Capital provides asset and investment advisory services relating to real estate holdings. We purchased this interest for $18 (of which $17 was from an entity controlled by our chairman, Daniel G. Cohen.) In addition, we also acquired a 10% interest in Amersfoort Office Investment I Cooperatief U. A. ( AOI\u201d), a real estate holding company, for $1 and subsequently invested $558. The investments in AOI and CK Capital Partners are included in equity method investments on the consolidated balance sheets. See notes 4,12, and 31 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n (1) On September 25, 2019, we amended and restated the previously outstanding 2013 Convertible Notes, which were scheduled to mature September 25, 2019. The material terms and conditions of the 2013 Convertible Notes remained substantially the \nAverage balances and period end balances will fluctuate based on market and liquidity conditions and we consider such intraperiod fluctuations as typical for the repurchase market. Month-end balances may be higher or lower than average period balances.\n o The Company entered into the SPA with Daniel G. Cohen and DGC Trust effective December 30, 2019. This transaction combined with the related issuance of series F preferred stock resulted in an increases in non-controlling interest of $7,779 and an increase in preferred stock of $22. See note 4 and 31 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense / (benefit) was $(841) for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to income tax expense / (benefit) of $(1,211) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The tax benefit recognized in 2018 was comprised of a current tax benefit of $4 and a deferred tax benefit of $837. The deferred tax benefit recognized in 2018 was the result of the net loss incurred by us in 2018. This net loss provided additional NOL carryforwards that can be recognized as a benefit to the extent such carryforwards can be scheduled against our deferred tax liability reversal. The tax benefit recognized in 2017 was comprised of $1,279 of deferred tax benefit, partially offset by $68 of current tax expense. The deferred tax benefit recognized in 2017 was primarily the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA\u201d). Among other things, the TCJA reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, we revalued our deferred tax liability and recognized a one-time tax deferred income tax benefit.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nFASB ASC 810, Consolidation ( ASC 810\u201d) contains the guidance surrounding the definition of VIEs, the definition of variable interests, and the consolidation rules surrounding VIEs. In general, VIEs are entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. As a general matter, a reporting entity must consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (a) the power to direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE's financial performance and (b) a significant variable interest in the VIE.\n\ufeff\nThe Sponsor Entities raised $2,550 from third-party investors and the remaining investment in the private placement was made by the Company. The Company consolidates the Sponsor Entities and treats its investment in the Insurance SPAC as an equity method investment. The $2,550 raised from third-party investors is treated as non-controlling interest. See notes 4 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe SPAC Funds primarily invest in the equity of SPACs and we carry our investment at its reported NAV. Income recognized in each period is the result of changes in the underlying NAV of the SPAC Funds as well as distributions received. See notes 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n o We entered into a credit facility with LegacyTexas Bank (the LegacyTexas Credit Facility\u201d) related to our ViaNova business line, which provides for draws up to $12,500. \nCapital Markets:\n\ufeff\nWe are a financial services company specializing in fixed income markets. We were founded in 1999 as an investment firm focused on small-cap banking institutions but have grown to provide an expanding range of capital markets and asset management services. We are organized into three business segments: Capital Markets, Asset Management, and Principal Investing.\n\ufeff\nNew issue and advisory revenue include: (i) new issue revenue associated with originating, arranging, or placing newly created financial instruments and (ii) revenue from advisory services. New issue and advisory revenue is recognized when all services have been provided and payment is earned.\nIncome Tax Expense / (Benefit)\nOn March 22, 2019, the Insurance SPAC completed the sale of 15,065,000 units (the SPAC Units\u201d) in its initial public offering (the IPO\u201d). Each SPAC Unit consists of one share of the SPAC's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ( SPAC Common Stock\u201d), and one-half of one warrant (each, a SPAC Warrant\u201d), where each whole SPAC Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The SPAC Units were sold in the IPO at an offering price of $10.00 per SPAC Unit, for gross proceeds of $150,650 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Pursuant to the underwriting agreement in the IPO, the Insurance SPAC granted the underwriters in the IPO (the Underwriters\u201d) a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,965,000 additional SPAC Units solely to cover over-allotments, if any (the Over-Allotment Option\u201d); and on March 22, 2019, the Underwriters exercised the Over-Allotment Option in full. Immediately following the completion of the IPO, there were an aggregate of 20,653,333 shares of SPAC Common Stock issued and outstanding.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-08, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic (718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Codification Improvements- Share-Based Consideration Payable to a Customer. This ASU requires companies to measure and classify (on the balance sheet) share-based payments to customers by applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. As a result, the amount recorded as a reduction in revenue would be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $903, or 11%, to $7,584 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $8,487 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we often incur certain costs related to new issue engagements. These costs are included as a component of either subscriptions, clearing and execution, or professional fees and other and will generally be recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nPrincipal Transactions\n\ufeff\nNew issue and advisory revenue decreased by $1,148, or 39%, to $1,831 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $2,979 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nAsset management revenue from Company-sponsored CDOs decreased by $3,891 to $4,028 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $7,919 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the periods presented by asset class.\nA substantial portion of our asset management fees are earned from the management of CDOs. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations.\nAmendments to 2013 Convertible Notes\nWe believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and other sources of credit. Due to the uncertainties that exist in the economy, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future.\nRedeemable Financial Instruments\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU is intended to simplify accounting for income taxes. It removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim period with those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nSPAC Funds\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCompensation and Benefits\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nOur AUM equals the sum of: (1) the gross assets included in CDOs that we have sponsored and manage; plus (2) the NAV of investment funds we manage; plus (3) the NAV or gross assets of other accounts we manage.\nInterest Expense, net\nOther income / (loss) includes foreign currency gains and losses, interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, interest earned and losses incurred on notes receivable, and other miscellaneous income including revenue from revenue sharing arrangements.\nInterest expense, net increased by $2,309, or 37%, to $8,487 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $6,178 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments in this ASU eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual or interim goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nEuroDekania was a company that invested in hybrid capital securities of European companies and we carried our investment at the reported NAV. Income recognized in each period was the result of changes in the underlying NAV of the fund as well as distributions received. EuroDekania sold its remaining investments and liquidated in 2019.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIn addition, as a smaller firm, we are exposed to intense competition. Although we provide financing to our customers, larger firms have a much greater capability to provide their clients with financing, giving them a competitive advantage. We are much more reliant upon our employees' relationships, networks, and abilities to identify and capitalize on market opportunities. Therefore, our business may be significantly impacted by the addition or loss of key personnel.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 During the fourth quarter of 2019, we purchased 23,000 shares of Common Stock for $230 or $10.00 per share from a former member of the board of directors. \nOn September 1, 2017, we filed two Articles of Amendment to our charter with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, pursuant to which we (i) changed our name to Cohen & Company Inc.\u201d; (ii) effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (iii) increased the par value of our Common Stock from $0.001 per share to $0.01 per share. All share and per share amounts for all periods presented herein reflect the reverse split as if it had occurred as of the beginning of the first period presented.\n\ufeff\nOn September 25, 2019, we amended and restated the previously outstanding 2013 Convertible Notes that were scheduled to mature on September 25, 2019. The material terms and conditions of the 2013 Convertible Notes remained substantially the same, except that (i) the maturity date thereof changed from September 25, 2019 to September 25, 2020; (ii) the conversion feature in the 2013 Convertible Notes was removed; (iii) the interest rate thereunder changed from 8% per annum (9% in the event of certain events of default) to 12% per annum (13% in the event of certain events of default); and (iv) the restrictions regarding prepayment were removed. The post amendment notes are referred to herein as the 2019 Senior Notes\u201d and the pre-amendment notes are referred to herein as the 2013 Convertible Notes.\u201d See note 33 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the issuance of the 2020 Senior Notes and partial repayment of the 2019 Senior Notes.\n\ufeff\nTherefore, subsequent to the SPA and taking into account the SPA Proxy, Cohen & Company Inc. own 28.75% of the economic interests of the Operating LLC and controls 51.00% of the voting interests of the Operating LLC. Because Cohen & Company Inc. continues to maintain voting control of the Operating LLC, Cohen & Company Inc. will continue to consolidate the Operating LLC in its consolidated financial statements. However, earnings shall be allocated to Cohen & Company Inc. and the other members of the Operating LLC based on their respective economic interests. Accordingly, the non-controlling interest percentage reflected in the consolidated statement of operations will change from 32.22% immediately prior to the effectiveness of the SPA to 71.25% immediately subsequent to the effectiveness of the SPA.\n o We raised an additional $1,268 from redeemable financial instruments via an additional investment by JKD Capital Partners I on January 9, 2019. On March 6, 2019, the agreement was amended to change the definition of Investment Return (as defined in the agreement). \n\ufeff\nOther asset management revenue increased by $2,568 to $4,617 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $2,049 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to performance fees being earned on and increases in the AUM of our managed accounts during 2018.\n\ufeff\nOur business environment is rapidly changing. New risks and uncertainties emerge continuously and it is not possible for us to predict all the risks we will face. This may negatively impact our operating performance.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nA substantial portion of our asset management revenue is earned from the management of CDOs. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations.\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNew issue and advisory\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Net interest income on our matched book repo financing activities; and \n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, we may have an interest in a VIE through the investments we make as part of our trading activities. Because of the high volume of trading activity in which we engage, we do not perform a formal assessment of each individual investment within our trading portfolio to determine if the investee is a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. Even if we were to obtain a variable interest in a VIE through our trading portfolio, we would not be deemed to be the primary beneficiary for two main reasons: (a) we do not usually obtain the power to direct activities that most significantly impact any investee's financial performance and (b) a scope exception exists within the consolidation guidance for cases where the reporting entity is a broker-dealer and any control (either as the primary beneficiary of a VIE or through a controlling interest in a voting interest entity) was deemed to be temporary. In the unlikely case that we obtained the power to direct activities and obtained a significant variable interest in an investee in our trading portfolio that was a VIE, any such control would be deemed to be temporary due to the rapid turnover within the trading portfolio.\nNet income / (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was comprised of the non-controlling interest related to member interests in the Operating LLC other than interests held by us for the relevant periods. In addition, net income / (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest also included non-controlling interest related to entities that were consolidated but not wholly owned by the Operating LLC.\n\ufeff\nPerformance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of the economy and financial market activity. Overall market conditions are a product of many factors beyond our control and can be unpredictable. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors including the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets, the level and shape of the various yield curves, and the volume and value of trading in securities.\nOur net trading revenue includes unrealized gains on our trading investments as of the applicable measurement date, which may never be realized due to changes in market or other conditions not in our control. This may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from these investments. In addition, our net trading revenue also includes realized gains on certain proprietary trading positions. Our ability to derive trading gains from such trading positions is subject to overall market conditions. Due to volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, the net trading revenue recognized during any year may not be indicative of future results. Furthermore, from time to time, some of the assets included in the Investments-trading line of our consolidated balance sheets represent level 3 valuations within the FASB valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets are carried at fair value based on estimates derived using internal valuation models and other estimates. See notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The fair value estimates determined by us may not be indicative of the final sale price at which these assets may be sold.\n o We raised $500 in proceeds from redeemable financial instruments related to ViaNova. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nThe revenue share arrangements noted in the table above entitle us to either a percentage of revenue earned by certain entities or a percentage of revenue earned above certain thresholds. See discussion of revenue share arrangements in Item 1 - Business\u201d beginning on page 5. These arrangements expire, or have expired, as follows:\n\ufeff\n (6) To fund potential repurchases of Common Stock. We have opportunistically repurchased Common Stock in private transactions as well through the 10b5-1 Plan. See note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nOur response to this margin compression has included: (i) building a diversified fixed income trading platform; (ii) acquiring or building out new product lines and expanding existing product lines; (iii) building a hedging execution and funding operation to service mortgage originators; (iv) becoming a full netting member of the FICC enabling us to expand our matched book repo business, and (v) monitoring our fixed costs. Our cost management initiatives are ongoing. However, there can be no certainty that these efforts will be sufficient. If insufficient, we will likely see a decline in profitability.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nSee notes 21 and 31 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nNon-Operating Income and Expense\nWe maintain repurchase agreements with various third-party financial institutions. There is no maximum limit as to the amount of securities that may be transferred pursuant to these agreements, and transactions are approved on a case-by-case basis. The repurchase agreements do not include substantive provisions other than those covenants and other customary provisions contained in standard master repurchase agreements. The repurchase agreements generally require us to transfer additional securities to the counterparty in the event the value of the securities then held by the counterparty in the margin account falls below specified levels and contain events of default were we to breach our obligations under the agreement. We receive margin calls from our repurchase agreement counterparties from time to time in the ordinary course of business. To date, we have maintained sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls, and we have never been unable to satisfy a margin call, however, no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy requests from our counterparties to post additional collateral in the future. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHow fair value determinations impact our financial statements\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 The Star Asia revenue share arrangement terminated during 2018. \n\ufeff\nWe adopted the fair value measurement provisions in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d), applicable to financial assets and financial liabilities effective January 1, 2008. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability between market participants at the measurement date ( exit price\u201d). An exit price valuation will include margins for risk even if they are not observable. In accordance with ASC 820, we categorize our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe account for our investment securities at fair value under various accounting literature, including Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities ( ASC 320\u201d), pertaining to investments in debt and equity securities and the fair value option of financial instruments in ASC 825, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825\u201d). We also account for certain assets at fair value under the applicable industry guidance, namely FASB ASC 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies ( ASC 946\u201d).\n\ufeff\n o We entered into the 2018 FT LOC credit facility with Fifth Third Bank ( FT Financial\u201d). Nothing has been drawn on this facility to date. \n\ufeff\n o We issued the 2017 Convertible Note in an aggregate principal amount of $15,000 to the DGC Trust. \n\ufeff\nNet trading includes: (i) all gains, losses, interest income, dividend income, and interest expense from securities classified as investments-trading and trading securities sold, not yet purchased; (ii) interest income and expense from collateralized securities transactions; and (iii) commissions and riskless trading profits. Net trading is reduced by margin interest, which is recorded on an accrual basis.\nWe consider our matched book repo business to be subject to significant concentration risk. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet Trading\n\ufeff\n (3) Represents redemption value of the redeemable financial instruments as of the reporting period. The redeemable financial instruments do not have a fixed maturity date. The period shown above represents the first period the holder of these instruments has the ability to require redemption by us. \n2019 Cash Flows\n\ufeff\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 7,890 shares in the open market under the 10b5-1 Plan for a total purchase price of $65. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 57,526 shares in the open market under the 10b5-1 Plan for a total purchase price of $594. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 15,270 shares in the open market under the 10b5-1 Plan for a total purchase price of $149.\n\ufeff\nWe may, from time to time, enter into derivatives to manage our risk exposures arising from (i) fluctuations in foreign currency rates with respect to our investments in foreign currency denominated investments; (ii) our investments in interest sensitive investments; and (iii) our facilitation of mortgage-backed trading. Derivatives entered into by us, from time to time, may include (i) foreign currency forward contracts; (ii) purchase and sale agreements of TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts; and (iii) other extended settlement trades.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nNet income / (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was comprised of the non-controlling interest related to member interests in the Operating LLC other than interests held by us for the relevant periods. In addition, net income / (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest also included non-controlling interest related to entities that were consolidated but not wholly owned by the Operating LLC.\n\ufeff\nAsset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - U.S. declined. In October 2018, the Alesco II CDO had a successful auction of its assets and liquidated. During 2018, the Company recorded management fee revenue of $3,211 associated with the Alesco II CDO, which included $2,974 earned upon the successful auction. The remaining reduction in asset management fees for TruPS and insurance company debt - U.S. was a result of average AUM declining due to principal repayments on the assets in these securitizations.\nPrincipal Investing:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe cash provided by investing activities of $2,156 was comprised of (a) $30,023 of sales and returns of principal from other investments, at fair value, partially offset by (b) $1,002 of cash used to purchase furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and (c) $26,865 of cash used to purchase other investments, at fair value.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nThe cash provided in financing activities of $5,936 was comprised of (a) $1,268 of proceeds from redeemable financing instrument (see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); (b) $4,777 in proceeds from net draws on the LegacyTexas Credit Facility (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); (c) $2,550 in proceeds from the issuance of non-controlling interests); partially offset by (d) $1,500 of cash\n\ufeff\nPrincipal Transactions and Other Income\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nBusiness Environment\nOur Asset Management Activities\n\ufeff\nNew Issue and Advisory Revenue\n\ufeff\nWe are the manager and a member of each of two entities: Insurance Acquisition Sponsor, LLC and Dioptra Advisors, LLC (together, the Sponsor Entities\u201d). The Sponsor Entities purchased 375,000 of the Insurance SPAC's placement units in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the IPO for an aggregate of $3,750, or $10.00 per placement unit. Each placement unit consists of one share of SPAC Common Stock and one-half of one warrant (the Placement Warrant\u201d). The placement units are identical to the SPAC Units sold in the IPO except (i) the shares of SPAC Common Stock issued as part of the placement units and the Placement Warrants will not be redeemable by the Insurance SPAC, (ii) the Placement Warrants may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis, (iii) the shares of SPAC Common Stock issued as part of the placement units, together with the Placement Warrants, are entitled to certain registration rights, and (iv) for so long as they are held by the Underwriter, the placement units will not be exercisable more than five years following the effective date of the registration statement filed by the Insurance SPAC in connection with the IPO. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the placement units (including the underlying Placement Warrants and SPAC Common Stock and the shares of SPAC Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Placement Warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We have agreed to lend the Insurance SPAC $750 for operating and acquisition related expenses. No amounts have been lent to date under this facility.\nOther income decreased by $165 to $583 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $748 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nImmediately prior to the effectiveness of the SPA, Cohen & Company Inc. owned 67.8% of the outstanding units of membership interests of the Operating LLC. Immediately subsequent to the effectiveness of the SPA, Cohen & Company Inc. owned 28.75% of the outstanding units of membership interests of the Operating LLC. As part of the SPA, Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust agreed to grant to Cohen & Company Inc. a proxy to vote, at any meeting of the Operating LLC, the number of the units of membership interests owned by Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust so that Cohen & Company Inc. would have 51.00% of the total votes eligible to vote at such meeting (the SPA Proxy\u201d). The actual units of membership interests that are subject to this proxy are determined at any meeting of the Operating LLC that a vote is held as follows: First, the total number of units of membership interests entitled to vote is determined. Second, the total number of units of membership interests entitled to vote is multiplied by 51.00% and the total units of membership interests held by Cohen & Company Inc. is subtracted from this amount. The result represents the total number of units of membership interests owned by Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust which will be subject to the SPA Proxy and that Cohen & Company Inc. will be entitled to vote. The number of units of membership interests subject to the proxy is allocated between Mr. Cohen and the DGC Trust on a pro rata allocation.\nEach time a cash dividend was declared by our board of directors, a pro rata distribution was made to the other members of the Operating LLC upon payment of dividends to our stockholders.\nA portion of our revenue is generated from management fees. Our ability to charge management fees and the amount of those fees is dependent upon the underlying investment performance and stability of the Investment Vehicles. If these types of investments do not provide attractive returns to investors, the demand for such instruments will likely fall, thereby reducing our opportunity to earn\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe can potentially become involved with a VIE in three main ways:\n\ufeff\nThe following table presents our period end balance, average monthly balance, and maximum balance at any month end for receivables under resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\n2018 Cash Flows\nNet Income / (Loss) Attributable to the Non-controlling Interest\n\ufeff\nWe do not utilize hedge accounting for our derivatives. Accordingly, all derivatives are carried at fair value with unrealized and realized gains recognized in earnings.\n\ufeff\nOn December 30, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SPA\u201d) with Daniel G. Cohen and the DGC Trust. In connection with the SPA, we purchased an aggregate of 662,361 shares of International Money Express, Inc. ( IMXI\u201d), an\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 New issue and advisory revenue comprised of (a) new issue revenue associated with originating, arranging, or placing newly created financial instruments; and (b) revenue from advisory services. \nOther income decreased by $4,838 to $748 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $5,586 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNew Issue and Advisory Revenue\n \u00b7 Gains and losses (unrealized and realized) and income and expense earned on securities classified as other investments, at fair value. \n\ufeff\n (1) Other Investment Vehicles include any Investment Vehicle that is not a Company sponsored CDO. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nEquity securities represented unrestricted and restricted equity investments in publicly traded corporations See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about how we determine the value of these instruments.\nOur new issue and advisory revenue has been, and we expect it will continue to be, volatile. We earn revenue from a limited number of engagements. Therefore, a small change in the number of engagements can result in large fluctuations in the revenue recognized. Further, even if the number of engagements remains consistent, the average revenue per engagement can fluctuate considerably. Finally, our revenue is generally earned when an underlying transaction closes (rather than on a monthly or quarterly basis). Therefore, the timing of underlying transactions increases the volatility of our revenue recognition.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements including ongoing commitments to repay debt borrowings, make interest payments on outstanding borrowings, fund investments, and support other general business purposes. In addition, our U.S., European, and United Kingdom broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to certain regulatory requirements to maintain minimum levels of net capital. Historically, our primary sources of funds have been our operating activities and general corporate borrowings. In addition, our trading operations have generally been financed by the use of collateralized securities financing arrangements as well as margin loans. In recent years, we have engaged in a number of capital raising transactions with Daniel G. Cohen, Chairman of the Board and President and Chief Executive of European operations, and/or persons or entities controlled by or close to Mr. Cohen because the terms of such transactions have been more favorable than terms available from unrelated third parties. Our ability to fund losses or expand our business operations on favorable terms in the future may depend on our continued ability to raise capital from Mr. Cohen and/or such persons and entities.\n\ufeff\nOperating Expenses\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 During 2019: \n\ufeff\nWe generate our revenue by business segment primarily through the following activities.\nAs a general rule, our trading business benefits from increased market volatility. Increased volatility usually results in increased activity from our clients and counterparties. However, periods of extreme volatility may at times result in clients reducing their trading volumes, which would negatively impact our results. Also, periods of extreme volatility may result in large fluctuations in securities valuations and we may incur losses on our holdings. Also, our mortgage group's business benefits when mortgage volumes increase, and may suffer when mortgage volumes decrease. Among other things, mortgage volumes are significantly impacted by changes in interest rates.\nSPAC equity positions represents unrestricted equity investments in publicly traded SPACs. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about how we determine the value of these instruments\nFinancial instruments carried at contract amounts with short-term maturities (one year or less) are repriced frequently or bear market interest rates. Accordingly, those contracts are carried at amounts approximating fair value. Financial instruments carried at contract amounts on our consolidated balance sheets include receivables from and payables to brokers, securities purchased under agreements to resell ( reverse repurchase agreements\u201d or receivables under resale agreements\u201d), and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase ( repurchase agreements\u201d).\n (2) In some cases, accounts we manage employ leverage. In some cases, our fees are based on gross assets while in other cases our fees are based on net assets. AUM included herein is calculated using either the gross or net assets of each Investment Vehicle based on whichever serves as the basis for calculation of our management fees. \nCash compensation and benefits in the table above is primarily comprised of salary, incentive compensation, and benefits. Cash compensation and benefits increased by $466 to $25,228 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $24,762 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our headcount increased to 94 as of December 31, 2019 from 88 as of December 31, 2018. Cash compensation increased primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation related to the increase in net trading revenue.\n\ufeff\n o We amended the previously outstanding 2013 Convertible Notes, extending the maturity date from September 25, 2019 to September 25, 2020, increasing the interest rate from 8% to 12%, and removing the conversion feature. The post amendment notes are referred to as the 2019 Senior Notes. \n (4) To fund mergers or acquisitions. We may opportunistically use capital to acquire other asset managers, individual asset management contracts, or financial services firms. To the extent our liquidity sources are insufficient to fund our future merger \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the valuation hierarchy. In such cases, the level of the valuation hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\n\nCDOs\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe cash used in financing activities of $3,722 was comprised of (a) $1,461 of cash used to repay a portion of the 2013 Convertible Notes (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); (b) $525 of payment of debt issuance costs; (c) $75 of cash used to net settle equity awards; (d) $769 of cash used to repurchase and retire Common Stock; (e) $426 of distributions to the non-controlling interests of the Operating LLC; (f) $966 of dividends to our stockholders. partially offset by (g) $500 of cash proceeds from redeemable financial instruments (see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\ufeff\nIn 2018, we formed a new subsidiary, ViaNova, for the purpose of building a RTL business. RTLs are small balance commercial loans secured by first lien mortgages used by professional investors and real estate developers to finance the purchase and rehabilitation of residential properties. ViaNova's business plan includes buying, aggregating, and distributing these loans to produce superior risk-adjusted returns through the pursuit of opportunities overlooked by commercial banks. To that end, we have hired four professionals and entered into a line of credit with LegacyTexas Bank. See notes 4, 19, and 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nAsset management fees for broadly syndicated loans - Europe consist of a single CLO. Fees declined primarily due to a decline in subordinated asset management fees. During 2018, the performance of the portfolio deteriorated and certain cash flow diversion features of the CLO were triggered. As a result, cash flow that would otherwise pay subordinated management fees was diverted to pay principal on the senior securities. In addition, fees declined because of a reduction in AUM due to principal payments received.\n\ufeff\nAll amounts in this disclosure are in thousands (except share, unit, per share, and per unit data) except where otherwise noted.\n\ufeff\nOperating Expenses\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\ufeff\nThe insurance company debt that will be acquired by the U.S. Insurance JV may be originated by JVB and there may be origination fees earned in connection with such transactions. We also earn management fees as manager of the U.S. Insurance JV. We are entitled to a quarterly base management fee, an annual incentive fee (if certain return hurdles are met), and an additional incentive fee upon the liquidation of the portfolio (if certain return hurdles are met). See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nRiskless trades are transacted through our proprietary account with a customer order in hand, resulting in little or no market risk to us. Transactions that settle in the regular way are recognized on a trade date basis. Extended settlement transactions are recognized on a settlement date basis (although in cases of extended settlement trades, the unsettled trade is accounted for as a derivative between trade and settlement date). See notes 3 and 10. The investments classified as trading are carried at fair value. The determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices of an active exchange, independent broker market quotations, market price quotations from third-party pricing services or, when independent broker quotations or market price quotations from third-party pricing services are unavailable, valuation models prepared by our management. The models include estimates, and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange. See note 9.\n o The Sponsor Entities raised $2,550 from equity investors, which is recorded as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. \n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have the following sources of financing, which we account for as redeemable financial instruments. See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\ufeff\nThe cash used by operating activities of $15,463 was comprised of (a) net cash outflows of $32,007 related to working capital fluctuations; (b) net cash inflows of $19,458 from trading activities comprised of our investments-trading, trading securities sold, not yet purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, receivables under resale agreements, and receivables and payables from brokers, dealers, and clearing agencies, as well as the changes in unrealized gains and losses on the investments-trading and trading securities sold, not yet purchased; and (c) net cash outflows from other earnings items of $2,914 (which represents net income or loss adjusted for the following non-cash operating items: other income / (expense), realized and unrealized gains and losses on other investments, income / (loss) from equity method affiliates, equity based compensation, depreciation, and amortization).\n \u00b7 During the third quarter of 2018, we purchased 17,555 shares of Common Stock for $176 or $10.00 per share from a current member of the board of directors. \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.

As of December 31, 2019, 79.7% of our existing AUM were CDOs. The creation of CDOs has depended upon a vibrant securitization market. Since 2008, volumes within the securitization market have dropped significantly and have not fully recovered since that time. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. The remaining portion of our AUM is from a diversified mix of other Investment Vehicles most of which were more recently formed.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nInsurance Acquisition Corporation (the Insurance SPAC\u201d)\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations below.\nIn recent years, our mortgage group has grown in significance to our Capital Markets segment and our company overall. The mortgage group primarily earns revenue by providing hedging execution, securities financing, and trade execution services to mortgage originators and other investors in mortgage backed securities. Therefore, this group's revenue is highly dependent on the volume of mortgage originations in the U.S. Origination activity is highly sensitive to interest rates, the U.S. job market, housing starts, sale activity of existing housing stock, as well as the general health of the U.S. economy. In addition, any new regulation that impacts U.S. government agency mortgage backed security issuance activity, residential mortgage underwriting standards, or otherwise impacts mortgage originators will impact our business. We have no control over these external factors and there is no effective way for us to hedge against these risks. Our mortgage group's volumes and profitability will be highly impacted by these external factors.\n o We repaid $1,461 of the 2013 Convertible Notes and extended the maturity of the remaining $6,786 outstanding 2013 Convertible Notes from September 25, 2018 to September 25, 2019. \nOur business in general and our Capital Markets business segment in particular, do not produce predictable earnings. Our results can vary dramatically from year to year and quarter to quarter.\n\ufeff\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had the following other significant financing transactions. See notes 19 and 20 in our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nBusiness development, occupancy, and equipment increased by $407, or 14%, to $3,402 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $2,995 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was comprised of an increase in business development of $148 and an increase in occupancy and equipment of $259. Occupancy and equipment increased primarily due to our entry into a new office lease for office space in New York City, which commenced in August 2018.\n\ufeff\nOther\n\ufeff\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were $14,106, representing a decrease of $8,827 from December 31, 2017. The decrease was attributable to the cash used by operating activities of $6,999, the cash provided by investing activities of $2,156, the cash used in financing activities of $3,722, and the decrease in cash resulting from a change in exchange rates of $262.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe cash used by operating activities of $6,999 was comprised of (a) net cash outflows of $2,896 related to working capital fluctuations; (b) net cash inflows of $2,219 from trading activities comprised of our investments-trading, trading securities sold, not yet purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, receivables from resale agreements, and receivables and payables from brokers, dealers, and clearing agencies, as well as the changes in unrealized gains and losses on the investments-trading and trading securities sold, not yet purchased; and (c) net cash outflows from other earnings items of $6,322 (which represents net income or loss adjusted for the following non-cash operating items: other income / (expense), realized and unrealized gains and losses on other investments, equity based compensation, depreciation, and amortization).\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nSecurities Financing\nOur currency hedge consisted of a Euro forward agreement designed to hedge the currency risk primarily associated with our investment in EuroDekania. We terminated this hedge during 2019 and do not expect to enter into this hedge going forward.\nOther Income\nOur calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations used by other asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. This definition of AUM is not necessarily identical to the definitions of AUM that may be used in our management agreements.\nThe incentive management fee is an additional payment, made typically after five to seven years of the life of a CDO, which is based on the clearance of an accumulated cash return on investment ( Hurdle Return\u201d) received by the most junior CDO securities holders. It is an incentive for us to perform in our role as asset manager by minimizing defaults and maximizing recoveries. The incentive management fee is not ultimately determined or payable until the achievement of the Hurdle Return by the most junior CDO securities holders. We recognize incentive fee revenue when it is probable and there is not a significant chance of reversal in the future.\n \u00b7 The IIFC revenue share arrangement expires at the earlier of (i) the dissolution of IIFC or (ii) when we have earned a cumulative $20,000 in revenue share payments. Through December 31, 2018, we had earned $2,185 in the aggregate. Also, in any particular year, the revenue share earned by us cannot exceed $2,000. \nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction Between Topic 808 and Topic 606. The ASU also provides more comparability in the presentation of revenue for certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants. It accomplishes this by allowing organizations to only present units of account in collaborative arrangements that are within the scope of the revenue recognition standard together with revenue accounted for under the revenue recognition standard. The parts of the collaborative arrangement that are not in the scope of the revenue recognition standard should be presented separately from revenue accounted for under the revenue recognition. This ASU is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nSee the statements of cash flows in our consolidated financial statements. We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, as well as our investment in our trading portfolio and related borrowing capacity, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the cash needs of our ongoing operations in the near term.\nAs of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, we maintained cash and cash equivalents of $8,304 and $14,106, respectively. We generated cash from or used cash for the activities described below.\nWe have three subsidiaries that are licensed securities dealers: JVB in the U.S., CCFL in the United Kingdom, and CCFEL in Ireland. As a U.S. broker-dealer, JVB is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule in Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. Our London-based subsidiary, CCFL, is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of the FCA and our Ireland-based subsidiary, CCFEL, is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of the CBI. The amount of net assets that these subsidiaries may distribute is subject to restrictions under these applicable net capital rules. These subsidiaries have historically operated in excess of minimum net capital requirements. Our minimum capital requirements at December 31, 2019 were as follows.\nA portion of our revenue is generated from new issue and advisory engagements. The fees charged and volume of these engagements are sensitive to the overall business environment. We provide investment banking and advisory services in Europe primarily through our subsidiary CCFEL and new issue services in the U.S. through our subsidiary JVB. Currently, our primary source of new issue revenue is from originating assets for our U.S. insurance asset management business and the PriDe funds and managed accounts.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe cash provided in financing activities of $23,118 was comprised of (a) $11,000 in proceeds from the issuance of the redeemable financial instrument (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); (b) $15,000 in proceeds from issuance of the 2017 Convertible Note (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); partially offset by (c) $800 in cash used to pay issuance and financing costs; (d) $100 in cash used to net settle equity awards; (e) $572 in repurchases of our Common Stock; (f) $985 of dividends to our stockholders; and (g) $425 of distributions to the non-controlling interests of the Operating LLC.\nIf the Insurance SPAC fails to consummate a Business Combination within the first 18 months following the IPO, its corporate existence will cease except for the purposes of winding up its affairs and liquidating its assets.\nOur business is materially affected by economic conditions in the financial markets, political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, the housing and mortgage markets, changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions, and changes in interest rates, including overnight funding rates, all of which can affect our profitability and are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors and companies, including their level of participation in the financial markets and their willingness to participate in corporate transactions. Severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce our trading volume and revenues, negatively affect our ability to generate new issue and advisory revenue, and adversely affect our profitability.\nCash Flows\nWe operate with more than the minimum regulatory capital requirement in our licensed broker-dealers and at December 31, 2019 total net capital, or the equivalent as defined by the relevant statutory regulations, in our licensed broker-dealers totaled $61,610. See note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, our licensed broker-dealers are generally subject to capital withdrawal notification and restrictions.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\n\ufeff\nThe Sponsor Entities collectively hold 5,103,333 founder shares of the Insurance SPAC. Subject to certain limited exceptions, placement units held by the Sponsor Entities will not be transferable or salable until 30 days following a Business Combination, and founder shares held by the Sponsor Entities will not be transferable or salable except (a) with respect to 20% of such shares, until consummation of a Business Combination, and (b) with respect to additional 20% tranches of such shares, when the closing price of the SPAC common stock exceeds $12.00, $13.50, $15.00, and $17.00, respectively, for 20 out of any 30 consecutive trading days following the consummation of a Business Combination, in each case subject to certain limited exceptions.\nIn the case of Investment Vehicles other than CDOs, generally we earn a base fee and, in some cases, also earns an incentive fee. Base fees will generally be recognized monthly as services are performed and will be paid monthly or quarterly. The contractual terms of each arrangement will determine our revenue recognition policy for incentive fees in each case. However, in all cases, we recognize the incentive fees when they are probable and there is not a significant chance of reversal in the future.\nAsset management fees increased by $4,639, or 59%, to $12,536 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $7,897 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as discussed in more detail below.\nPrincipal transactions and other income\n\ufeff\nAsset management fees decreased by $4,976, or 40%, to $7,560 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $12,536 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as discussed in more detail below.\nThe senior asset management fee is generally senior to all the securities in the CDO capital structure and is recognized on a monthly basis as services are performed. The senior asset management fee is generally paid on a quarterly basis.\n\ufeff\nU.S. Housing Market\nThe cash used by operating activities of $11,916 was comprised of (a) net cash inflows of $3,659 related to working capital fluctuations; (b) net cash outflows of $18,224 from trading activities comprised of our investments-trading, trading securities sold, not yet purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, receivables from resales agreements, and receivables and payables from brokers, dealers, and clearing agencies, as well as the changes in unrealized gains and losses on the investments-trading and trading securities sold, not yet purchased; and (c) net cash inflows from other earnings items of $2,649 (which represents net income or loss adjusted for the following non-cash operating items: other income / (expense), realized and unrealized gains and losses on other investments, equity based compensation, depreciation, and amortization).\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Asset Management: Our Asset Management business segment manages assets within CDOs, managed accounts, joint ventures, and investment funds (collectively, Investment Vehicles\u201d). A CDO is a form of secured borrowing. The borrowing is secured by different types of fixed income assets such as corporate or mortgage loans or bonds. The borrowing is in the form of a securitization, which means that the lenders are actually investing in notes backed by the assets. In the event of default, the lenders will have recourse only to the assets securing the loan. Our Asset Management business segment includes our fee-based asset management operations, which include on-going base and incentive management fees. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2.76 billion in AUM of which 79.7%, or $2.20 billion, was in CDOs. A substantial portion of our asset management revenue is earned from the management of CDOs. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations. The remaining portion of our AUM is from a diversified mix of other Investment Vehicles that were more recently formed. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n2017 Cash Flows\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Our trading activities, which include execution and brokerage services, securities lending activities, riskless trading activities, as well as gains and losses (unrealized and realized) and income and expense earned on securities classified as trading; \nThe proceeds from the placement units were added to the net proceeds from the IPO to be held in a trust account. If the Insurance SPAC does not complete a Business Combination within the first 18 months following the IPO, the proceeds from the sale of the placement units will be used to fund the redemption of the SPAC Common Stock sold as part of the SPAC Units in the IPO (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Placement Warrants will expire worthless.\nHow we determine fair value for securities\n\ufeff\n\nAsset management revenue from Company-sponsored CDOs increased by $2,071 to $7,919 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $5,848 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the periods presented by asset class.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n (5) Represents material operating contracts for various services. \nIn October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Target Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities. The ASU made targeted changes to the related party consolidation guidance. The new guidance changes how entities evaluate decision-making fees under the variable interest entity guidance. To determine whether decision-making fees represent a variable interest, an entity will need to consider indirect interests held through related parties under common control on a proportionate basis under the new guidance, rather than in their entirety, as has been the case under current guidance. The guidance is effective in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nNew issue and advisory revenue decreased by $3,361, or 53%, to $2,979 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $6,340 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nRevenues increased by $280, or 1%, to $49,666 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $49,386 for the year ended December 31, 2018. As discussed in more detail below, the change was comprised of (i) an increase of $8,874 in net trading revenue; (ii) a decrease of $4,976 in asset management revenue; (iii) a decrease of $1,148 in new issue and advisory revenue; and (iv) a decrease of $2,470 in principal transactions and other income.\n\ufeff\nThe subordinated asset management fee is an additional payment for the same services but has a lower priority in the CDO cash flows. If the CDO experiences a certain level of asset defaults and deferrals, these fees may not be paid. There is no recovery by the CDO of previously paid subordinated asset management fees. It is our policy to recognize these fees on a monthly basis as services are performed. The subordinated asset management fee is generally paid on a quarterly basis. However, if we determine that the subordinated asset management fee will not be paid (which generally occurs on the quarterly payment date), we will stop recognizing additional subordinated asset management fees on that particular CDO and will reverse any subordinated asset management fees that are accrued and unpaid. We will begin accruing the subordinated asset management fee again if payment resumes and, in management's estimate, continued payment is reasonably assured. If payment were to resume but we were unsure of continued payment, we would recognize the subordinated asset management fee as payments were received and would not accrue such fees on a monthly basis.\nAn event of default under the clearing agreement would give the counterparty the option to terminate the clearing arrangement. Any amounts owed to the clearing broker would be immediately due and payable. These obligations are recourse to us. Furthermore, a termination of any of our clearing arrangements would result in a significant disruption to our business and would have a significant negative impact on our dealings and relationship with our customers.\nAll of the securities we own that are classified as investments-trading, securities sold, not yet purchased, or other investments, at fair value are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value (both unrealized and realized) recorded in earnings.\n\ufeff\nViaNova\nIn June 2018, in response to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, we formed a new subsidiary, CCFEL in Ireland, for the purpose of seeking to become regulated to perform asset management and capital markets activities in Ireland and the European Union. In April 2019, CCFEL received authorization from the CBI under the European Union (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2017 to provide investment services in respect of certain financial instruments including transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and various option, futures, swaps, forward rate agreements and other derivative contracts ( Financial Instruments\u201d). The services for which CCFEL received authorization include the receipt and transmission of orders in relation to Financial Instruments, the execution of orders on behalf of clients, portfolio management, investment advice and investment research, and financial analysis. In addition, CCFEL applied for approval of a French branch, which approval was granted by the CBI and the branch was authorized by the French regulators in April 2019. Following authorization of the French Branch of CCFEL, various contracts originally entered into by CCFL were novated to the French Branch of CCFEL. The novation of contracts was completed on July 1, 2019.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nName Change; Common Stock Reverse Stock Split\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $57, or 22%, to $318 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $261 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was the result of additional leasehold improvements during 2019.\nSubscriptions, Clearing, and Execution\n\ufeff\nThe U.S. Insurance JV is a company that invests in debt issued by insurance companies and we carry our investment at its NAV. Income recognized in each period is the result of changes in the underlying NAV of the fund as well as distributions received. See notes 4 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n\nA portion of our revenue is generated from net trading activity. We engage in proprietary trading for our own account, provide securities financing for our customers, and execute riskless\u201d trades with a customer order in hand resulting in limited market risk to us. The inventory of securities held for our own account, as well as held to facilitate customer trades, and our market making activities are sensitive to market movements.\n\ufeff\nHow we determine fair value for investments in investment funds and similar vehicles\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nSince March 17, 2016, we entered into two letter agreements (together, the 10b5-1 Plan\u201d) with Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. (the Agent\u201d). The most recent letter agreement provided for the Agent to purchase up to an aggregate maximum of $2,000 of Common Stock and was in effect until March 19, 2019. It expired on that date and we did not enter into a new letter agreement. Pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan, purchases of Common Stock may have been made in public and private transactions and were required to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The 10b5-1 Plan was designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\nPrincipal transactions and other income decreased by $1,823 to $4,573 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $6,396 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nSee notes 19 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nFor each investment made within the principal investing portfolio, we assess whether the investee is a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. If we determine the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, we will consolidate it.\nDebt Financing\nOther than as described in note 10 (derivative financial instruments) and note 18 (variable interest entities) to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there were no material off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet Trading\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 Asset management fees for our on-going asset management services provided to certain Investment Vehicles, which may include fees both senior and subordinate to the securities issued by the Investment Vehicle; and \n\ufeff\n (1) Non-controlling interest is recorded on a monthly basis. Because earnings are recognized unevenly throughout the year and the non-controlling interest percentage may change during the period, the average effective non-controlling interest percentage may not equal the percentage at the end of any period or the simple average of the beginning and ending percentages. The non-controlling interest percentage changed to 72.25% effective December 30, 2019. This change did not have a significant impact the average for the year ended December 31, 2019, but we expect it to have a much greater impact going forward. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe try to address these challenges by (i) focusing our business on clients and asset classes that are underserved by the large firms, (ii) continuing to monitor our fixed costs to enhance operating leverage and limit our losses during periods of low volumes, and (iii) attempting to hire and retain entrepreneurial and effective traders and salespeople.\n\ufeff\nWe are the sponsor of the Insurance SPAC, a blank check company seeking to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses (each a Business Combination\u201d).\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCertain subsidiaries of the Operating LLC have restrictions on the withdrawal of capital and otherwise in making distributions and loans. JVB is subject to net capital restrictions imposed by the SEC and FINRA that require certain minimum levels of net capital to remain in this subsidiary. In addition, these restrictions could potentially impose notice requirements or limit our ability to withdraw capital above the required minimum amounts (excess capital) whether through a distribution or a loan. CCFL is regulated by the\n\n\ufeff\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including fair value of financial instruments. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n \u00b7 The Alesco X-XVII revenue share arrangement expired in February 2017. Included in the revenue share revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1,579 of contingent amounts that became due upon the conclusion of the arrangement. No additional revenue will be earned from this arrangement. \n\ufeff\nOur net trading revenue includes unrealized gains on our trading investments, as of the applicable measurement date that may never be realized due to changes in market or other conditions not in our control. This may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from these investments. In addition, our net trading revenue also includes realized gains on certain proprietary trading positions. Our ability to derive trading gains from such trading positions is subject to overall market conditions. Due to volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, the net trading revenue recognized during the year may not be indicative of future results. Furthermore, from time to time, some of the assets included in the Investments-trading line of our consolidated balance sheets represent level 3 valuations within the FASB valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets are carried at fair value based on estimates derived using internal valuation models and other estimates. See notes 9 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The fair value estimates made by us may not be indicative of the final sale price at which these assets may be sold.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOn August 2, 2019, our board of directors announced that we have decided to suspend our quarterly cash dividend. We currently intend to use the related annual cash savings to invest in new business initiatives and improve our financial position. Any future determination to declare and pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account a variety of factors, including business, financial, and regulatory considerations as well as any limitations under Maryland law or imposed by any agreements governing our indebtedness. Going forward, the board of directors will re-assess our capital resources and may or may not determine to reinstate the dividend based on that assessment.\nThe determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices of an active exchange, independent broker market quotations, market price quotations from third-party pricing services, or, when independent broker quotations or market price quotations from third-party pricing services are unavailable, valuation models prepared by management. These models include estimates and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nIn May 2018, we committed to invest up to $3,000 in a newly formed joint venture (the U.S. Insurance JV\u201d) with an outside investor that committed to invest approximately $63,000 of equity in the U.S. Insurance JV. The U.S. Insurance JV was formed for the purposes of investing in debt issued by small and medium sized U.S. and Bermuda insurance and reinsurance companies and is managed by Dekania Capital Management, LLC, a registered investment adviser subsidiary of the Company ( DCM\u201d). We are required to invest 4.5% of the total equity of the U.S. Insurance JV with an absolute limit of $3,000. The U.S. Insurance JV may use leverage to grow its assets. As of December 31, 2019, we had invested $2,642.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe U.S. Insurance JV is an investment company and we carry our investment at the NAV of the fund. Income recognized in each period is the result of changes in the underlying NAV of the fund as well as distributions received. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes our long-term indebtedness and other financing outstanding. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\n (3) The junior subordinated notes listed represent debt the Company owes to the two trusts noted above. The total par amount owed by the Company to the trusts is $49,614. However, the Company owns the common stock of the trusts in a total par amount of $1,489. The Company pays interest (and at maturity, principal) to the trusts on the entire $49,614 junior notes outstanding. However, the Company receives back from the trusts the pro rata share of interest and principal on the common stock held by the Company. These trusts are variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) and the Company does not consolidate them even though the Company holds the common stock. The Company carries the common stock on its balance sheet at a value of $0. The junior subordinated notes are recorded at a discount to par. When factoring in the discount, the yield to maturity of the junior subordinated notes as of December 31, 2019 on a combined basis is 15.04% assuming the variable rate in effect on the last day of the reporting period remains in effect until maturity. \nDepreciation and amortization increased by $12, or 5%, to $261 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $249 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe revenue share arrangements noted in the table above entitle us to either a percentage of revenue earned by certain entities or a percentage of revenue earned above certain thresholds. See discussion of revenue share arrangements in Item 1 - Business\u201d beginning on page 5.
