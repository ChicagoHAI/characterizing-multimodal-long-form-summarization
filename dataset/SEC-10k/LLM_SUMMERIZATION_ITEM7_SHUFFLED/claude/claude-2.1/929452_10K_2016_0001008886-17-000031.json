We have grown substantially by increasing the geographic reach of our service center network and by expanding the breadth of our services for customers. Our Trucking segment provides truckload transportation, including dedicated services, of various products, goods, and materials for our diverse customer base through our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operating units. The Brokerage and Intermodal operating units of our Logistics segment provide a multitude of shipment solutions, including additional sources of truckload capacity and alternative transportation modes, by utilizing our vast network of third-party capacity providers and rail providers, as well as certain logistics, freight management, and other non-Trucking services. Our objective is to operate our Trucking and Logistics businesses with industry-leading margins and growth, while providing safe, high-quality, cost-effective solutions for our customers.\nFactors that affect our results of operations are industry-wide economic factors, such as freight demand, truckload and rail intermodal capacity, fuel prices, inventory levels, industrial production, government regulation, and unemployment rates, as well as our capital allocation, sales and marketing, operating, and spending decisions. We measure our results through key metrics, such as the number of tractors we operate, our revenue per tractor (which includes primarily our revenue per total mile and our number of miles per tractor), freight volumes brokered to third-party capacity providers (including our rail partners), driver and independent contractor recruitment and retention, and our ability to control costs on a company-wide basis, as measured by cost per mile in our Trucking segment and non-GAAP operating ratio ( Adjusted Operating Ratio\u201d) in both segments. Please see the reconciliation table below for a reconciliation of GAAP operating ratio to Adjusted Operating Ratio. Our success depends on our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our resources in providing transportation and logistics solutions to our customers in light of such factors. We evaluate the growth opportunities for each of our Trucking and Logistics businesses based on customer demand and supply chain trends, availability of drivers and third-party capacity providers, expected returns on invested capital, expected net cash flows, and our company-specific capabilities.\nRecent Consolidated Results of Operations and Year-End Financial Condition\nOur consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, were as follows:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Total revenue decreased 5.5%, to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net income attributable to Knight Transportation decreased 19.6%, to $93.9 million from $116.7 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net earnings attributable to Knight Transportation per diluted share decreased 18.4%, to $1.16 from $1.42.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue and net income decreased in 2016, compared to 2015. The freight environment was more challenging in 2016 compared to 2015, but modestly improved as the year progressed. We attribute the change to excess trucking capacity in the markets we serve, and fewer non-contract opportunities that reduced our revenue per loaded mile. However, we sustained improvement in our asset utilization and experienced more favorable freight conditions toward the end of the year. In this environment, we diligently focused our efforts on cost control and continued to seek operational efficiencies, while providing industry-leading service.\nIn 2016, our Trucking segment operated an average of 4,706 tractors, a decrease of 87 tractors from a year ago. Asset utilization, as measured by average miles per tractor, improved 1.4% in 2016 compared to 2015, while productivity, as measured by average annual revenue per tractor, before fuel surcharge, decreased 0.7% in 2016. Our Trucking segment achieved an operating ratio of 84.9% and an Adjusted Operating Ratio of 83.2% in 2016, compared to an Adjusted Operating Ratio of 80.5% in 2015. Higher net fuel expense, less gain on sale of revenue equipment, and higher driver-related expenses were the main factors negatively affecting our 2016 operating results when compared to the prior year. Shipments serviced by our Logistics segment increased as we continued to increase our Logistics services customers, and to expand our third-party carrier network. However, revenues in our Logistics segment decreased 5.7% in 2016, compared to 2015, due to a decrease in revenue per load.\nIn 2016, we generated $243.4 million in cash flow from operations and used $89.0 million for capital expenditures, net of equipment sales. During 2016, we returned $59.5 million to our shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and stock repurchases. We ended the year with $8.0 million of cash, $18.0 million of long-term debt, and $786.5 million of shareholders' equity.\nThe factors below should be considered when comparing our results of operations in 2016 to our results of operations in 2015. Our 2016 results included:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> a $2.5 million pretax ($1.5 million after-tax) settlement expense for two class action lawsuits;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> an $8.1 million pretax ($5.0 million after-tax) gain on sale of equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> a $4.5 million pretax ($2.8 million after-tax) gain on sale of available-for-sale securities; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> an effective tax rate that positively affected net income by $1.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2015 results included:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> a $7.2 million pretax ($4.4 million after-tax) settlement expense for two class action lawsuits;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> a $15.3 million pretax ($9.7 million after-tax) gain in sale of equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> an $8.6 million pretax ($5.3 million after-tax) gain on sale of available-for-sale securities; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> an effective tax rate that positively affected net income by $5.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur liquidity is not materially affected by off-balance sheet transactions. See the discussion under \"Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\" under Item 7 to Part II of this Annual Report for a description of our off-balance sheet transactions.\nConsolidated Revenue and Expenses\nWe primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers in our Trucking segment or arranging for the transportation of customer freight by third-party capacity providers in our Logistics segment. Our total revenue is reported under \"Results of Operations\" under Item 7 to Part II of this Annual Report and categorized as (i) Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge, (ii) Trucking fuel surcharge revenue, and (iii) Logistics revenue. Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge, and Trucking fuel surcharge revenue are largely generated by the Trucking services provided by our three Trucking operating units (Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage), whereas Logistics revenue is mostly generated by the logistics services provided by our two Logistics operating units (Brokerage and Intermodal). We also provide logistics, freight management, sourcing, and other non-Trucking services, such as used equipment sales and leasing to independent contractors and third-parties through our Logistics business.\nThe total revenue and operating expenses of our Trucking and Logistics segments are similarly affected by certain factors that generally relate to, among other things, overall economic and weather conditions in the United States, customer inventory levels, specific customer demand, the levels of truckload and rail intermodal capacity, and availability of qualified drivers, independent contractors, and third-party capacity providers. See the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d set forth above, along with various disclosures in our press releases, shareholder reports, and other filings with the SEC.\nTo reduce our risk to fuel price fluctuations in our Trucking segment, we have a fuel surcharge program under which we obtain from our customers additional fuel surcharges that generally recover a majority, but not all, of the increased fuel costs; however, we cannot ensure whether current recovery levels will continue in the future. In discussing our overall and segment-based results of operations, because changes in fuel costs typically cause fuel surcharge revenue to fluctuate, we identify Trucking fuel surcharge revenue separately and omit fuel surcharge revenue from our statistical calculations. We believe that omitting this potentially volatile source of revenue provides a more meaningful comparison of our operating results from period to period.\nThe following table sets forth revenue and operating income between the Trucking and Logistics segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands).\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

<td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe primary measures we use to evaluate the profitability of our Trucking segment are operating ratio, measured on a GAAP basis (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of revenue), and Adjusted Operating Ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure (operating expenses, net of Trucking fuel surcharge revenue, expressed as a percentage of Trucking revenue, excluding Trucking fuel surcharge revenue). We believe the use of Adjusted Operating Ratio allows us to more effectively compare periods, while excluding the potentially volatile effect of changes in fuel prices. The Board and management focus on our Adjusted Operating Ratio as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of Adjusted Operating Ratio is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance.\nAdjusted Operating Ratio is not a substitute for operating ratio measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Although we believe that Adjusted Operating Ratio improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define Adjusted Operating Ratio differently. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Operating Ratio should not be considered a measure of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nThe tables below compare our GAAP operating ratio to our non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Ratio (dollars in thousands).\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> GAAP Presentation:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nTrucking Strategy and Segment Information\nOur Trucking operating strategy is to achieve a high level of asset utilization within a highly disciplined operating system, while maintaining strict controls over our cost structure. To achieve these goals, we operate primarily in high-density, predictable freight lanes in select geographic regions and attempt to develop and expand our customer base around each of our service centers by providing multiple truckload services for each customer. This operating strategy allows us to take advantage of the large amount of freight transported in regional markets. Our service centers enable us to better serve our customers and work more closely with our driving associates. We operate a premium modern fleet to appeal to drivers and customers, reduce maintenance expenses and driver and equipment downtime, and enhance our fuel and other operating efficiencies. We employ technology in a cost-effective manner to assist us in controlling operating costs and enhancing revenue.\nTrucking revenue is generated by our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operating units. Generally, we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our Trucking services. Additional revenues are generated by charging for tractor and trailer detention, loading and unloading activities, dedicated services, and other specialized services, as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel. The main factors that affect our Trucking revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, and the number of loaded miles we generate with our equipment.\nEffectively controlling our expenses is an important element of maximizing our profitability. The most significant expenses of our Trucking segment are primarily variable and include fuel and fuel taxes, driver-related expenses (such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment) and costs associated with independent contractors (which are primarily included in purchased transportation expense recorded on the \"Purchased transportation\" line of our consolidated statements of income). Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance expense (which includes costs for replacement tires for our revenue equipment) and our total cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency, and other factors. The main fixed costs for our Trucking segment are the acquisition and depreciation of long-term assets (such as revenue equipment and service centers) and the compensation of non-driver personnel.\nWhen evaluating Trucking revenue, we consider the following key operating statistics for each period: (i) average revenue per tractor; (ii) average length of haul (miles with loaded trailer cargo); (iii) average percentage of non-paid empty miles (miles without trailer cargo); and (iv) average number of tractors and trailers in operation. The following table sets forth certain key operating statistics and certain other statistical data of the Trucking segment for the indicated periods (dollars in thousands).\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per tractor(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,185\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 173,329\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,510\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average length of haul\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-paid empty mile percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average tractors in operation during period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,706\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,793\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,173\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average trailers in operation during period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,288\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11,789\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,732\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Average revenue per tractor is based on Trucking revenue, net of intersegment transactions, and does not include fuel surcharge revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Trucking segment requires substantial capital expenditures for purchases of new revenue equipment. We fund these purchases with cash flows from operations and financing available under our existing line of credit. We operated an average of 4,706 tractors in 2016, of which 4,286 were company-owned tractors. The average age of our company-owned tractor fleet was 1.9 years at December 31, 2016, which we expect to increase slightly in 2017. We also operated an average of 12,288 trailers in 2016, with an average age of 4.4 years as of December 31, 2016. We expect the average age of our trailers to remain relatively constant in 2017. Our net property and equipment at December 31, 2016 was $802.9 million, most of which relates to our Trucking segment.\nOur capital expenditures can also affect depreciation expense. Trucking depreciation relates primarily to our owned tractors, trailers, ELDs and other communication units, and other similar assets. Changes to this fixed cost are generally attributed to increases or decreases to company-owned equipment and fluctuations in new equipment purchase prices, which have historically been precipitated in part by new or proposed federal and state regulations (such as the EPA engine emissions requirements relating to post-2014 model tractors and the California trailer efficiency requirements). Depreciation can also be affected by the cost of used equipment that we sell or trade and the replacement of older used equipment. Our management periodically reviews the condition, average age, and reasonableness of estimated useful lives and salvage values of our equipment and considers such factors in light of our experience with similar assets, used equipment market conditions, and prevailing industry practice. Total Trucking segment depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $111.7 million in 2016.\nLogistics Strategy and Segment Information\nLogistics revenue is generated primarily by our Brokerage and Intermodal operating units. We also provide logistics, freight management and other non-Trucking services to our customers through our Logistics business. We are generally paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for arranging freight transportation for our customers and providing other Logistics services. Additional revenue is generated by offering specialized logistics solutions (including, but not limited to, origin management, surge volumes, disaster relief, special projects, and other logistics needs). Our Logistics revenue is mainly affected by the rates we obtain from customers, the freight volumes we ship through our third-party capacity providers, and our ability to secure qualified third-party capacity providers to transport customer freight. Increases in shipments serviced by our Brokerage and Intermodal operating units and continued increases in the number of customers utilizing our Logistics services contributed to the improved productivity realized in 2016. We were able to provide Logistics services to our existing customers as well as effectively expand to new customers in 2016.\nOur Logistics segment is less asset-intensive and is instead dependent upon capable non-driver personnel, modern and effective information technology, and qualified third-party capacity providers. The most significant expense of our Logistics segment, which is primarily variable, is the cost of purchased transportation that we pay to third-party capacity providers (including rail providers), which is included in the \"Purchased transportation\" line of our consolidated statements of income. This expense generally varies depending upon truckload and rail capacity, availability of third-party capacity providers, rates charged to customers, and current freight demand and customer shipping needs. Other Logistics operating expenses are generally fixed and primarily include the compensation and benefits of non-driver personnel (included in the \"Salaries, wages and benefits\" line of our consolidated statements of income) and depreciation and amortization expense.\nThe following table sets forth the Logistics segment revenue, operating expenses, and operating income (dollars in

measure the Logistics segment's profitability by reviewing the gross margin percentage (revenue net of intersegment transactions, less purchased transportation expense, net of intersegment transactions, expressed as a percentage of revenue net of intersegment transactions) and the operating ratio. The gross margin percentage can be affected by customer rates and the costs of securing third-party capacity providers. Our third-party capacity providers are generally not subject to long-term or predetermined contracted rates, and our operating results could be affected if the availability of third-party capacity providers or the rates for such providers change in the future. The following table lists the gross margin percentage for our Brokerage and Intermodal businesses combined.\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined Brokerage and Intermodal gross margin percent(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Gross margin percentage is based on Logistics revenue and purchased transportation net of intersegment transactions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur gross margin percentage remained consistent in 2016 from 2015, but our operating margin contracted. The primary reason for the operating margin contraction was lower revenue per load.\nSince our Logistics segment depends on effective usage of information systems and technology that enable us to efficiently arrange for the transportation of our customers' freight and remain resourceful and responsive in meeting customer shipping needs. As our Logistics services evolve, we may incur costs to upgrade, integrate, or expand our information systems and technology, but we do not expect that costs for such improvements will require significant capital expenditures in the future. Total Logistics segment depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $4.4 million in 2016, which is primarily attributed to equipment leased to third parties.\nTrends and Outlook\nWe have created a service network with financial accountability, a modern tractor fleet, access to thousands of third-party capacity transportation providers, and the capability of providing multiple transportation service offerings and modes to customers in North America. We believe our operating strategies are contributing factors to our revenue and earnings growth over time.\nIn 2016, we experienced a challenging freight environment and although we made improvements in miles per tractor, we continued to experience excess trucking capacity in the markets we serve, which led to a more competitive pricing market and fewer non-contract opportunities that pressured our revenue per loaded mile. The market began to improve in the second half of the year and a more typical, but less robust seasonal freight market transpired. Market factors that included higher driver wages, lower gain on sale of revenue equipment, and fewer non-contract opportunities negatively affected our margins in our Trucking and Logistics segments.\nIn 2017, we expect the freight environment to continue to be challenging until capacity begins to tighten as a result of low new tractor orders, a weak demand for used equipment, and additional regulatory burdens expected to phase in over the coming quarters. We expect the environment to become more favorable in the second half of the year, as we believe capacity will continue to exit the market and pricing will respond positively. Market factors that include higher driver wages, lower gain on sale of revenue equipment, and fewer non-contract opportunities may negatively affect our margins in our Trucking and Logistics segments. In this environment, we plan to limit organic fleet expansion, focus on cost control, grow revenues in our Logistics segment, and continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities.\nOver the medium- to long-term, we believe capacity in the truckload market will be constrained by an increasingly competitive driver market, elevated regulatory costs for trucking companies and drivers, and potentially alternative employment opportunities for drivers we wish to hire. These factors are expected generally to have a positive impact on industry-wide rate structures. However, reduced hours of operation and driver shortages could negatively affect equipment utilization, even in a stronger demand environment. In such an environment, we believe carriers that are well-positioned to develop and retain drivers, withstand supply and demand fluctuations, and provide safe, dependable, and high-quality service to customers will have opportunities to increase freight rates and market share. We believe domestic and global economic and political conditions present the most direct challenges to improved freight demand. These threats include fluctuations in commodity prices, an inability of the United States government to timely and adequately address fiscal issues, currency fluctuations, or other factors outside our control could reduce consumer spending or industrial investment, thus negatively affecting freight volumes. In addition, the competitive landscape and the supply chains of our customers are constantly shifting based on manufacturing and transportation costs, business combinations, inventory levels, and other factors.\nSeveral issues affecting the trucking industry could also cause our costs to increase in future periods. These issues include driver and independent contractor availability, fuel price fluctuations, increases to new tractor and trailer purchase prices, and changes in federal and state regulations. From a cost perspective, recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers, independent contractors, and third-party capacity providers may become increasingly costly; equipment prices may continue to rise, medical, workers' compensation, and litigation expenses are increasing more rapidly than general inflation, and potentially higher fuel prices may not be fully offset by fuel surcharges. In the current economic and regulatory environments, it will be important to allocate equipment to more profitable shipments, use technology to generate efficiencies, continue to grow our Logistics segment, and effectively manage costs. We believe we have the service center network, modern tractor fleet, comprehensive truckload and logistics services, management team and qualified personnel, technology, intense focus on cost control, and capital resources necessary to successfully overcome these challenges and capitalize on future opportunities.\nWe expect to continue to utilize the flexibility of our model to react and adapt to market conditions. We believe we can optimize our model and refine our execution in reaction to, or in anticipation of, transportation market dynamics, particularly the markets for truckload and logistics services that we offer. We plan to continue to evaluate additional strategic acquisitions to supplement our growth.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of income in dollars and

<td> Purchased transportation expense is comprised of (a) payments to independent contractors, which are primarily attributed to our Trucking segment; (b) payments to third-party capacity providers, which are primarily attributed to our Logistics segment; and (c) payments relating to our logistics, freight management and non-Trucking services. Purchased transportation expense is further discussed in the year-to-year comparison of operating results below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nOperating Revenue\nTotal revenue decreased 5.5% for 2016 to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion for 2015 generally due to a more challenging freight environment when compared to 2015. Both our Trucking and Logistics segments experienced a moderate freight market where excess capacity reduced contract pricing and non-contract opportunities were limited, when compared to the prior year, which combined with fewer trucks, lower fuel surcharge revenue, and less non-Trucking services revenue, led to the decline in total revenue.\nTrucking revenue, net of fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, was $810.4 million in 2016 compared to $830.7 million in 2015. Trucking fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $89.9 million in 2016 from $121.2 million in 2015, as fuel prices were consistently lower during 2016 compared to 2015. We increased average miles per tractor 1.4% in 2016, compared to 2015. However, this improvement was offset by a decrease in average revenue per loaded mile by 1.5%, and an increase in non-paid empty mile percentage rate to 12.5% from 12.0%. This negatively affected our tractor productivity, as measured by average annual Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge, per tractor, which decreased by 0.7% in 2016, compared to 2015. If economic conditions improve and capacity tightens, we anticipate that we will be able to obtain rate increases in 2017 and beyond; however, adverse changes in these factors could either prevent rate increases or negatively affect existing rates.\nLogistics revenue is primarily generated by the Brokerage and Intermodal operating units. Logistics revenue was $217.8 million in 2016 compared to $231.0 million in 2015. Logistics revenue decreased primarily due to declining revenue from our non-Trucking services as we exited our agricultural sourcing business in the first quarter of 2016, as well as due to lower revenue per load because of lower fuel surcharge. Revenue in our Brokerage business, which is the largest component of our Logistics segment, decreased in 2016 compared to 2015; however, we continued to see load volume growth. A shorter length of haul and lower non-contract pricing offset this load volume growth. We achieved this growth by providing more capacity to our customers through our third-party carriers and rail providers.\nOperating Expenses\nSalaries, wages and benefits expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 29.9% in 2016 from 28.2% in 2015. Costs associated with healthcare benefits provided to our employees and accruals for workers' compensation benefits are components of our salaries, wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income. The primary reason for the increase is attributable to lower total revenue in 2016 compared to 2015, as the dollar expense remained relatively flat. Additional factors affecting this expense included further increases to driver base pay during 2016, and a shift from driver pay to purchased transportation expense, as more of our fleet was comprised of independent contractors in 2016 compared to 2015. We believe that the driver market remains challenging and that several ongoing market factors, including the CSA implementation of stricter regulations, has further reduced the pool of available drivers. We expect that driver pay will continue to be inflationary on a year-over-year basis. Having a sufficient number of qualified driving associates continues to be a major concern, although we continue to seek ways to attract and retain qualified driving associates, including investing in technology and service centers that improve the experience of drivers.\nFuel expense decreased, as a percentage of total revenue, to 11.6% in 2016, from 12.9% in 2015, as the U.S. National Average Diesel Fuel price decreased by 14.9% in 2016. Fuel expense, net of Trucking fuel surcharge, expressed as a percentage of Trucking revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, increased to 4.9% in 2016, from 3.8% in 2015. Our fuel surcharge program helps to offset increases in fuel prices, but applies only to loaded miles and typically does not offset non-paid empty miles, idle time, and out of route miles driven. Typical fuel surcharge programs involve a computation based on the change in national or regional fuel prices. These programs may update as often as weekly, but typically require a specified minimum change in fuel cost to prompt a change in Trucking fuel surcharge revenue. Therefore, many of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when the change is reflected in Trucking fuel surcharge revenue. Due to this time lag, our fuel expense, net of fuel surcharge, negatively affects our operating income during periods of sharply rising fuel costs and positively affects our operating income during periods of falling fuel costs. Fuel prices were falling throughout 2015 and bottomed out in the first quarter of 2016, before rising in each of the remaining quarters of 2016. We expect fuel expense will continue to increase during the first part of 2017. We continue to utilize fuel efficiency initiatives, such as trailer blades, idle-control, more fuel-efficient engines, and driver training programs that we believe will help to control our fuel expense.\nOperations and maintenance expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 6.8% in 2016 and 2015. Operations and maintenance expense consists of direct operating expense, equipment maintenance, and tire expense. Operations and maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, decreased to 7.4% in 2016 from 7.6% in 2015, due to improved cost control measures. Direct operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, in 2016 due to lower operating supply costs and drayage related operating costs. We continue to experience tight driver market conditions, and we expect the driver market to remain competitive in 2017, which could negatively affect our recruiting costs.\nInsurance and claims expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 3.1% in 2016, from 2.9% in 2015. Insurance and claims expense as a percentage of total revenue, excluding fuel surcharge, increased slightly to 3.3% in 2016 from 3.2% in 2015, and increased slightly on a per mile basis, year-over-year. The increase was partly due to the decrease in total revenue in 2016 from 2015, combined with slightly higher premium costs and changes in the severity of claims. Insurance and claims expense consists of premiums for liability, physical damage, and cargo, and will vary based upon the frequency and severity of claims, as well as our level of self-insurance, and premium expense.\nOperating taxes and licenses expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 1.6% in 2016 and 2015. This expense line item is impacted by changes in various fuel tax rates and registration fees associated with our tractor fleet and regional operating facilities.\nCommunications expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 0.4% for 2016 and 2015. Communications expense is comprised of costs associated with our tractor and trailer tracking systems, information technology systems, and phone systems.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 10.4% for 2016 from 9.4% in 2015, in part due to the decrease in fuel surcharge revenue. As a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, depreciation and amortization increased to 11.3% in 2016 from 10.5% in 2015. This increase was due to a combination of the decrease in revenue, before fuel surcharge, driven by the decrease in average revenue per tractor in our Trucking segment, and the decrease in revenue from our less asset-intensive Logistics segment, driven by the decrease in revenue per load and reduced non-Trucking service revenue. Depreciation and amortization expense for our Trucking segment, as a percentage of Trucking revenue, was 13.8% in 2016, compared to 12.9% in 2015. Factors contributing to the increase were the decrease in average revenue per tractor, rising new equipment prices, and an increase in our tractor to trailer ratio. Absent offsetting improvements in average revenue per tractor or growth in our Logistics operations, our expense as a percentage of revenue in this category could increase in the future. With rising equipment prices, and a continuing soft used equipment market, we have extended the expected trade cycle for our tractors, which is expected to reduce capital expenditures and restrict higher depreciation and amortization costs in the future. In implementing the extended trade cycle, we have been proactive in managing our preventative maintenance program with a goal of mitigating the additional maintenance cost commonly associated with a slightly older fleet.\nPurchased transportation expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 20.9% for 2016 and 2015. Purchased transportation expense is comprised of (i) payments to independent contractors for our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operations in our Trucking segment; (ii) payments to third-party capacity providers for our Brokerage operations and to railroads for our Intermodal operations; and (iii) payments relating to logistics freight management, and non-Trucking services in our Logistics segment. The overall decrease in this category is primarily due to lower fuel surcharge equivalent payments to independent contractors and third-party capacity providers. Purchased transportation costs generally take into account changes in diesel fuel prices, resulting in lower payments during periods of declining fuel prices. Purchased transportation expense within our Logistics segment decreased as expected with the decrease in Logistics revenue, but this decrease was hindered by increased costs associated with exiting our agriculture sourcing business in the first quarter of 2016. We expect purchased transportation will increase as a percentage of total revenue, if we are successful in continuing to grow our Logistics segment.\nMiscellaneous operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased slightly to 2.0% in 2016, from 1.9% for 2015. The increase is due in part to the decrease in Trucking fuel surcharge revenue, and less gain on sale of equipment to offset these costs. However, in both 2016 and 2015, we recorded infrequent expenses ($2.5 million pretax ($1.5 million after tax), and $7.2 million pretax ($4.4 million after tax)) respectively, relating to expected settlement costs for class action lawsuits involving employment-related claims in California and Oregon. Excluding these infrequent expenses, and excluding the effect of the decrease in the fuel surcharge component of total revenue, and lower gain on sale of equipment, miscellaneous operating expenses decreased due to decreased legal expense associated with the prior year infrequent claim expense, and decreased costs associated with technology and our management information systems. Gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses and decreased to $8.1 million in 2016, from $15.3 million in 2015, as a result of a soft used equipment resale market prevalent in 2016. We believe the used equipment market will continue to help offset other miscellaneous operating expenses, but not to the extent as it did in prior years, as the used equipment market softened beginning in the third quarter of 2015 and we expect a similar environment through the first half of 2017.\nAs a result of the above factors, our GAAP operating ratio (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue) was 86.7% for 2016, compared to 85.0% for 2015. Our Adjusted Operating Ratio (total operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge, as a percentage of total revenue, before fuel surcharge), was 85.6% in 2016, compared to 83.2% in 2015. Please see the reconciliation table above for a reconciliation of GAAP operating ratio to Adjusted Operating Ratio.\nNet interest and other income, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 0.4% in 2016 from 0.8% in 2015. Other income includes realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities and unrealized gains from our investments in TRP investments that use the equity method of accounting. Our realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities were lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to fewer securities sold during 2016. We repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock in 2016 for $39.9 million, and interest expense decreased in 2016 because of the decreased average borrowing during the year. Our debt balance decreased to $18.0 million at December 31, 2016 from $112.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nWe provide for income taxes at the statutory federal and state rates, adjusted for permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting. Our effective tax rate was 38.0% for 2016 and 36.8% for 2015. The unusually low rate in 2015 was attributable to favorable tax positions taken on amended federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and other miscellaneous non-recurring decreases, which positively impacted our net income by approximately $5.4 million.\nAs a result of the preceding factors, our net income attributable to Knight Transportation decreased to 8.4%, compared to 9.9% in 2015.\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nOperating Revenue\nTotal revenue increased 7.3% for 2015 to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion for 2014, generally because of increased tractor productivity and average revenue per loaded mile in our Trucking segment and shipment volume growth in our Logistics segment.\nTrucking revenue increased to $830.7 million in 2015 from $715.7 million in 2014. Trucking fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $121.2 million in 2015 from $176.3 million in 2014, as fuel prices declined in each quarter of 2015. Tractor productivity, as measured by average annual Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge per tractor, increased in 2015, compared to 2014. This was attributable to improved contract pricing. Average revenue per loaded mile increased 4.2%, as we improved pricing, but was partially offset by an increase in non-paid empty mile percentage rate to 12.0% from 10.1%.\nLogistics revenue is primarily generated by the Brokerage and Intermodal operating units. Logistics revenue was $231.0 million in 2015 and $210.3 million in 2014. We achieved the increase in revenue by providing more capacity to our customers through our third-party carriers and rail providers. Shipment volume growth in our Brokerage business, which is the largest component of our Logistics segment, increased 47.9% in 2015 compared to 2014, as we continued to increase our buyer pool, which lead to increased access to third-party capacity. Although our revenue per load was negatively affected in 2015 as a result of lower fuel surcharge, a shorter length of haul, and fewer non-contract opportunities, we continued to expand gross margins.\nOperating Expenses\nSalaries, wages and benefits expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 28.2% in 2015 from 24.7% in 2014. Costs associated with healthcare benefits provided to our employees and accruals for workers' compensation benefits are components of our salaries, wages and benefits expense in our consolidated statements of income. Factors contributing to the increase include increases in driver base pay, and a shift from purchased transportation expense to driver salaries and wages expense, as a greater percentage of our tractor fleet was comprised of company tractors rather than independent contractors. Our non-driver personnel salaries and wages increased, as did our payroll taxes and costs associated with benefits provided, as we increased our number of employees, particularly in our Logistics segment. We improved our pay and performance bonus for our driving associates in 2015 in response to an increasingly challenging driver market.\nFuel expense decreased, as a percentage of total revenue, to 12.9% in 2015, from 18.5% in 2014, as the U.S. National Average Diesel Fuel price decreased by 29.2% in 2015. Fuel expense, net of Trucking fuel surcharge, expressed as a percentage of Trucking revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, remained flat year-over-year. Our fuel efficiency initiatives, such as trailer blades, idle-control, more fuel-efficient engines, and driver training programs, continued to be contributing factors in controlling our fuel expense on a cost per company tractor operated mile basis. However, as a percentage of revenue, net fuel expense was consistent, as lower diesel fuel prices and improved fuel efficiency were offset by a greater percentage of miles operated by company-owned tractors (for which we pay the fuel cost) instead of independent contractors (who bear their own fuel cost) in 2015 compared to 2014, as well as an increase in non-paid empty miles percentage (for which we do not receive fuel surcharges). As discussed above, due to the time lag inherent in the fuel surcharge program, our fuel expense, net of fuel surcharge, negatively affects our operating income during periods of sharply rising fuel costs and positively affects our operating income during periods of falling fuel costs. Fuel prices began falling toward the end of 2014 and continued to fall each quarter in 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014.\nOperations and maintenance expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 6.8% in 2015 from 6.5% in 2014. Operations and maintenance expense consists of direct operating expense, equipment maintenance, and tire expense. Operations and maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, decreased slightly to 7.6% in 2015 from 7.7% in 2014, as a result of the increased revenue generated in 2015 compared to 2014.\nInsurance and claims expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased slightly to 2.9% in 2015, from 2.8% in 2014. Insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenue, before fuel surcharge, decreased to 3.2% in 2015 from 3.4% in 2014, and decreased slightly on a per mile basis, year-over-year. Insurance and claims expense consists of premiums for liability, physical damage, and cargo, and will vary based upon the frequency and severity of claims, as well as our level of self-insurance, and premium expense.\nOperating taxes and licenses expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 1.6% for 2015 and 2014. This expense line item is impacted by changes in various fuel tax rates and registration fees associated with our tractor fleet and regional operating facilities.\nCommunications expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 0.4% for 2015 and 2014. Communications expense is comprised of our tractor and trailer tracking systems, information technology systems, and phone systems.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 9.4% for 2015 from 8.4% in 2014, primarily because of the decrease in fuel surcharge revenue. As a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, depreciation and amortization increased to 10.5% in 2015 from 10.0% in 2014, as our Trucking revenue growth outpaced revenue growth in our Logistics segment, which is less capital intensive. A greater percentage of our tractor fleet was comprised of company-owned tractors rather than tractors provided by independent contractors, and we experienced higher equipment prices. Depreciation and amortization expense for our Trucking segment, as a percentage of Trucking revenue, was 12.9% in 2015 and 12.3% in 2014. The increased expense is primarily related to the increased number of tractors and trailers owned during 2015. The increased expense was partially offset by higher average revenue per tractor. The majority of our company-owned tractor fleet is comprised of tractors with 2014 compliant engines, which are more expensive than previous tractors due to compliance with NHTSA and EPA emissions standards.\nPurchased transportation expense, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased to 20.9% for 2015 from 21.6% for 2014. Purchased transportation expense is comprised of (i) payments to independent contractors for our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operations in our Trucking segment; and (ii) payments to third-party capacity providers for our Brokerage operations and to railroads for our Intermodal operations; and (iii) payments relating to logistics freight management, and non-Trucking services in our Logistics segment. The overall decrease in this category is primarily due to lower fuel surcharge equivalent payments to independent contractors and third-party capacity providers, a smaller percentage of our miles being operated by independent contractors, and the growth in our larger Trucking segment operations, which grew revenues by 16.1% in 2015. Purchased transportation expense attributed to payments to third-party capacity providers (including railroads and sourcing activities) in our Logistics segment increased 10.4% in 2015, when compared to 2014. Purchased transportation costs generally take into account changes in diesel fuel prices, resulting in lower payments during periods of declining fuel prices.\nMiscellaneous operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 1.9% in 2015, from 0.7% for 2014. The increase is primarily due to the infrequent expense recorded in the second quarter of 2015 for $7.2 million pretax ($4.4 million after tax) relating to expected settlement costs of two class action lawsuits involving employment-related claims in California and Oregon, and also due in part to the decrease in Trucking fuel surcharge component of total revenue, and less gain on sale of equipment to offset these costs. Excluding this infrequent expense, and excluding the effect of the decrease in the fuel surcharge component of consolidated revenue, and lower gain on sale of equipment, miscellaneous operating expenses increased due to increased legal expense associated with the infrequent claim expense, an increase in costs associated with technology and our management information systems, and revenue equipment operating lease expense. Gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses and decreased to $15.3 million in 2015, from $16.8 million in 2014.\nAs a result of the above factors, our GAAP operating ratio (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue) was 85.0% for 2015, compared to 85.2% for 2014. Our Adjusted Operating Ratio (total operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge, as a percentage of revenue, before fuel surcharge), was 83.2% in 2015, compared to 82.4% in 2014. Please see the reconciliation table above for a reconciliation of GAAP operating ratio to Adjusted Operating Ratio.\nNet interest and other income, as a percentage of revenue, remained constant at 0.8% in 2015, and 2014. Other income included realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities and unrealized gains from our investments in TRP III using the equity method of accounting. Our realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities were higher in 2015, compared to 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we funded the acquisition of Barr-Nunn for approximately $112.4 million with borrowings from our existing line of credit. We repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock in 2015 for $45.3 million, and interest expense increased in 2015 because of the increased average borrowing during the year. Our debt balance decreased to $112.0 million at December 31, 2015, from $134.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nWe provide for income taxes at the statutory federal and state rates, adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting. Our effective tax rate was 36.8% for 2015 and 39.7% for 2014. The unusually low rate in 2015 was attributable to favorable tax positions taken on amended federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and other miscellaneous non-recurring decreases, that positively affected our net income by approximately $5.4 million.\nAs a result of the preceding factors, our net income attributable to Knight Transportation increased to 9.9%, compared to 9.3% in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe growth of our business has required, and will continue to require, significant investments. In our Trucking business, where investments are substantial, the primary investments are in new tractors and trailers and, to a lesser extent, in technology, service centers, and working capital. In our Logistics business, where investments are modest, the primary investments are in technology and working capital. Our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and borrowings under our line of credit.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $243.4 million, $205.8 million, and $177.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase for 2016 is primarily due to lower income tax payments made in 2016, as we depleted the large income tax receivable balance on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $101.0 million, $138.3 million, and $266.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The higher investment total in 2014 is due to the acquisition of Barr-Nunn in the fourth quarter of 2014 for approximately $110.5 million total consideration. Excluding the Barr-Nunn acquisition, capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment (net of equipment sales and trade-ins), office equipment, and land and leasehold improvements totaled $89.0 million, $149.4 million, and $178.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in 2016 is due to our decision to limit organic fleet expansion and extend the expected trade cycle of our tractors in response to a challenging freight market and soft used equipment market. Excluding any acquisitions, we currently anticipate capital expenditures, net of trade-ins, of approximately $95.0 million to $110.0 million for 2017. We expect to use our capital expenditure estimate primarily to acquire new revenue equipment for replacement and not fleet growth.\nNet cash from financing activities typically varies with borrowing activity on our line of credit. In 2016 and 2015, we had net payments to our line of credit of $94.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively, while in 2014, we had net proceeds from borrowing on our line of credit of $96.4 million to fund the purchase of Barr-Nunn. Exercises of stock options and repurchases of our common stock also contributed to the changes in cash used or provided by financing activities during the three years ended December 31, 2016. We repurchased $39.9 million of our common stock on the open market in 2016, and $45.3 million in 2015, while we did not repurchase any of our common stock in 2014. Proceeds from exercises of stock options were $13.2 million, $9.9 million, and $24.4 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We returned $19.6 million, $19.9 million, and $19.6 million to our shareholders by way of dividends in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nWe currently maintain a line of credit that permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit up to an aggregate of $300.0 million and matures on August 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount outstanding under our line of credit was $18.0 million, which is classified as a long-term liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We also utilized a portion of our line of credit for letters of credit, which are issued to various regulatory authorities and insurance carriers in connection with our self-insurance programs. The issued but unused letters of credit totaled $31.3 million as of December 31, 2016 and $27.4 million as of December 31, 2015. Combining the amounts borrowed and letters of credit issued, we had $250.7 million available for future borrowing under our existing line of credit as of December 31, 2016, compared to $160.6 million as of December 31, 2015. Under our current line of credit agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain financial and other covenants and were in compliance with those covenants as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $8.0 million, compared to $8.7 million as of December 31, 2015. During the next twelve months and beyond, we believe that we will be able to finance our short-term needs for working capital and acquisitions of revenue equipment with cash, cash flows from operations, and financing available under our existing line of credit. We expect to have significant capital requirements over the long-term, which may require us to incur additional debt or seek additional equity capital. The availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions, the market price of our common stock, our financial condition and results of operations, and several other factors over which we have limited control. Nevertheless, based on our recent operating results, current cash position, anticipated future cash flows, and sources of available financing, we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nOur liquidity is not materially affected by off-balance sheet transactions. Like many other transportation companies, we have periodically utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment requirements and terminal facilities requirements. We lease revenue equipment under non-cancellable operating leases, and we lease some of our service centers and temporary trailer storage under non-cancellable operating leases. Operating lease expense for such equipment, facilities and trailer storage is reflected in the \"Miscellaneous operating expenses\" line in our consolidated statements of income, and totaled $5.0 million, $4.7 million, and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016, our contractual obligations and payments due by corresponding period for our short- and long-term operating expenses and other commitments (amounts in thousands).\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 year or\nless\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,041\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,041\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment commitments(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,740\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,038\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,870\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases - buildings & equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,871\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,253\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,297\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 151,434\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125,603\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,669\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,526\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Purchase obligations primarily consist of obligations to purchase revenue equipment from contracted vendors, and a carry forward of approximately $3.5 million from 2016 contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Long-term debt of $18.0 million is borrowings under our line of credit, which has a maturity date of August 2019.

Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts, and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nA summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies:\nProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment is depreciated to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life, which ranges from one to thirty years. Salvage values range from zero to 25% of the capitalized cost. We periodically review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets based upon, among other things, our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and prevailing industry practice. We both routinely and periodically review and make a determination whether the salvage value of our tractors and trailers is higher or lower than originally expected. This determination is based upon (i) market conditions in equipment sales, (ii) the guaranteed repurchase price with contracted dealerships, and (iii) the average miles driven on the equipment being sold. Future changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates, or fluctuation in market value not reflected in our estimates, could have a material effect on our results of operations. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances for indications that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, we compare the carrying value of our assets to the fair value to determine if any impairment exists. In the event that the carrying value exceeds the fair market value, we will adjust the property and equipment to the fair value and recognize any impairment loss. Our assets classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or net selling value.\nClaims Accrual. Reserves are established based on estimated or expected losses for claims. The primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability, personal injury, property damage, collision, comprehensive, workers' compensation, and employee medical expenses. We maintain self-insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self-insured liabilities. We also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self-insurance amounts. The reserves are analyzed quarterly and represent accruals for the estimated self-insured portion of pending claims, including adverse development of known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, the facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. We have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability would be adversely affected.\nIn addition to estimates within our self-insured retention, we also must make judgments concerning our coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. Currently, we are not aware of any such claims. If one or more claims were to exceed our effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, in accordance with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations and because any deferred assets can be fully offset by deferred liabilities. Accordingly, if the facts or financial results were to change in such a way as to affect the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets, judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in the appropriate period.\nManagement judgment is also required regarding a variety of other factors including the appropriateness of tax strategies, expected future tax consequences based on our future performance, and our likelihood of success in the event that tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities. We utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall income taxes. It is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed, resulting in an increased liability for income taxes. Significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs. An ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA tax benefit or liability from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.\nShare-Based Payments. We have stock options outstanding under our stock compensation plan. Exercises are permitted in pre-determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant. Each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant; expiration will not exceed ten years from the date of the grant. The calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments. These estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of our stock options is expensed on a straight-line basis, which generally ranges between five to seven years. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero-coupon Treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option. Management judgment is required to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model; management bases those decisions on historical data. The expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share-based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding.\nBeginning in 2014, we issued performance restricted stock units ( PRSUs\u201d), to selected key employees, that may be earned based on achieving performance targets approved by our compensation committee annually. The initial award is subject to an adjustment determined by our performance achieved over a three-year performance period when compared to the objective performance standards adopted by the Compensation Committee; this adjustment ranges from 0 percent to 150 percent of the initial amount of the grant. A further adjustment is made based on our total shareholder return compared to a peer group approved by our Compensation Committee. This adjustment ranges from 75 percent to 125 percent of the award after adjustment for our performance. Furthermore, the PRSUs have additional service requirements subsequent to the achievement of the performance targets. PRSUs do not earn dividend equivalents. The fair value of each PRSU grant is estimated on the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model. Compensation expense is recognized straight-line over the requisite service period based on management's estimated probability of the performance targets being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date.\nWe have service and performance-based restricted stock awards outstanding. Our compensation expense is based on fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 under which we estimate the expense.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements set forth beginning at page of this report for discussion of new accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Our gross margin percentage remained consistent in 2016 from 2015, but our operating margin contracted. The primary reason for the operating margin contraction was lower revenue per load.\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nOver the medium- to long-term, we believe capacity in the truckload market will be constrained by an increasingly competitive driver market, elevated regulatory costs for trucking companies and drivers, and potentially alternative employment opportunities for drivers we wish to hire. These factors are expected generally to have a positive impact on industry-wide rate structures. However, reduced hours of operation and driver shortages could negatively affect equipment utilization, even in a stronger demand environment. In such an environment, we believe carriers that are well-positioned to develop and retain drivers, withstand supply and demand fluctuations, and provide safe, dependable, and high-quality service to customers will have opportunities to increase freight rates and market share. We believe domestic and global economic and political conditions present the most direct challenges to improved freight demand. These threats include fluctuations in commodity prices, an inability of the United States government to timely and adequately address fiscal issues, currency fluctuations, or other factors outside our control could reduce consumer spending or industrial investment, thus negatively affecting freight volumes. In addition, the competitive landscape and the supply chains of our customers are constantly shifting based on manufacturing and transportation costs, business combinations, inventory levels, and other factors.\nMiscellaneous operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased slightly to 2.0% in 2016, from 1.9% for 2015. The increase is due in part to the decrease in Trucking fuel surcharge revenue, and less gain on sale of equipment to offset these costs. However, in both 2016 and 2015, we recorded infrequent expenses ($2.5 million pretax ($1.5 million after tax), and $7.2 million pretax ($4.4 million after tax)) respectively, relating to expected settlement costs for class action lawsuits involving employment-related claims in California and Oregon. Excluding these infrequent expenses, and excluding the effect of the decrease in the fuel surcharge component of total revenue, and lower gain on sale of equipment, miscellaneous operating expenses decreased due to decreased legal expense associated with the prior year infrequent claim expense, and decreased costs associated with technology and our management information systems. Gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses and decreased to $8.1 million in 2016, from $15.3 million in 2015, as a result of a soft used equipment resale market prevalent in 2016. We believe the used equipment market will continue to help offset other miscellaneous operating expenses, but not to the extent as it did in prior years, as the used equipment market softened beginning in the third quarter of 2015 and we expect a similar environment through the first half of 2017.\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined Brokerage and Intermodal gross margin percent(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue and net income decreased in 2016, compared to 2015. The freight environment was more challenging in 2016 compared to 2015, but modestly improved as the year progressed. We attribute the change to excess trucking capacity in the markets we serve, and fewer non-contract opportunities that reduced our revenue per loaded mile. However, we sustained improvement in our asset utilization and experienced more favorable freight conditions toward the end of the year. In this environment, we diligently focused our efforts on cost control and continued to seek operational efficiencies, while providing industry-leading service.\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per tractor(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,185\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 173,329\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,510\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average length of haul\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-paid empty mile percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average tractors in operation during period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,706\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,793\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,173\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average trailers in operation during period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,288\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11,789\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,732\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe total revenue and operating expenses of our Trucking and Logistics segments are similarly affected by certain factors that generally relate to, among other things, overall economic and weather conditions in the United States, customer inventory levels, specific customer demand, the levels of truckload and rail intermodal capacity, and availability of qualified drivers, independent contractors, and third-party capacity providers. See the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d set forth above, along with various disclosures in our press releases, shareholder reports, and other filings with the SEC.\nIn 2016, we experienced a challenging freight environment and although we made improvements in miles per tractor, we continued to experience excess trucking capacity in the markets we serve, which led to a more competitive pricing market and fewer non-contract opportunities that pressured our revenue per loaded mile. The market began to improve in the second half of the year and a more typical, but less robust seasonal freight market transpired.

In discussing our overall and segment-based results of operations, because changes in fuel costs typically cause fuel surcharge revenue to fluctuate, we identify Trucking fuel surcharge revenue separately and omit fuel surcharge revenue from our statistical calculations. We believe that omitting this potentially volatile source of revenue provides a more meaningful comparison of our operating results from period to period.\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trucking Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 900,368\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 80.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 952,098\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 80.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 892,124\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 80.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logistics Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 226,912\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 249,365\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 214,378\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,127,280\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,201,463\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,106,502\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intersegment Eliminations Trucking\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (124\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (163\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (65\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intersegment Eliminations Logistics\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9,122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (18,336\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,105\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,118,034\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,182,964\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,102,332\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trucking Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 136,229\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 91.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,143\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 91.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,424\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 90.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logistics Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,857\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,298\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 148,479\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 178,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,722\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts, and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nOperating taxes and licenses expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 1.6% for 2015 and 2014. This expense line item is impacted by changes in various fuel tax rates and registration fees associated with our tractor fleet and regional operating facilities.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> GAAP Presentation:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trucking\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 900,368\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 952,098\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 892,124\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 764,139\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 84.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 789,955\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 83.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 744,700\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 83.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 136,229\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,143\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,424\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nFuel expense decreased, as a percentage of total revenue, to 12.9% in 2015, from 18.5% in 2014, as the U.S. National Average Diesel Fuel price decreased by 29.2% in 2015. Fuel expense, net of Trucking fuel surcharge, expressed as a percentage of Trucking revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, remained flat year-over-year. Our fuel efficiency initiatives, such as trailer blades, idle-control, more fuel-efficient engines, and driver training programs, continued to be contributing factors in controlling our fuel expense on a cost per company tractor operated mile basis. However, as a percentage of revenue, net fuel expense was consistent, as lower diesel fuel prices and improved fuel efficiency were offset by a greater percentage of miles operated by company-owned tractors (for which we pay the fuel cost) instead of independent contractors (who bear their own fuel cost) in 2015 compared to 2014, as well as an increase in non-paid empty miles percentage (for which we do not receive fuel surcharges). As discussed above, due to the time lag inherent in the fuel surcharge program, our fuel expense, net of fuel surcharge, negatively affects our operating income during periods of sharply rising fuel costs and positively affects our operating income during periods of falling fuel costs. Fuel prices began falling toward the end of 2014 and continued to fall each quarter in 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014.\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> a $2.5 million pretax ($1.5 million after-tax) settlement expense for two class action lawsuits;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> an $8.1 million pretax ($5.0 million after-tax) gain on sale of equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> a $4.5 million pretax ($2.8 million after-tax) gain on sale of available-for-sale securities; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> an effective tax rate that positively affected net income by $1.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe tables below compare our GAAP operating ratio to our non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Ratio (dollars in thousands).\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, in accordance with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations and because any deferred assets can be fully offset by deferred liabilities. Accordingly, if the facts or financial results were to change in such a way as to affect the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets, judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in the appropriate period.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> a $7.2 million pretax ($4.4 million after-tax) settlement expense for two class action lawsuits;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> a $15.3 million pretax ($9.7 million after-tax) gain in sale of equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> an $8.6 million pretax ($5.3 million after-tax) gain on sale of available-for-sale securities; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> an effective tax rate that positively affected net income by $5.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMiscellaneous operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 1.9% in 2015, from 0.7% for 2014. The increase is primarily due to the infrequent expense recorded in the second quarter of 2015 for $7.2 million pretax ($4.4 million after tax) relating to expected settlement costs of two class action lawsuits involving employment-related claims in California and Oregon, and also due in part to the decrease in Trucking fuel surcharge component of total revenue, and less gain on sale of equipment to offset these costs. Excluding this infrequent expense, and excluding the effect of the decrease in the fuel surcharge component of consolidated revenue, and lower gain on sale of equipment, miscellaneous operating expenses increased due to increased legal expense associated with the infrequent claim expense, an increase in costs associated with technology and our management information systems, and revenue equipment operating lease expense. Gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses and decreased to $15.3 million in 2015, from $16.8 million in 2014.\nTotal revenue decreased 5.5% for 2016 to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion for 2015 generally due to a more challenging freight environment when compared to 2015. Both our Trucking and Logistics segments experienced a moderate freight market where excess capacity reduced contract pricing and non-contract opportunities were limited, when compared to the prior year, which combined with fewer trucks, lower fuel surcharge revenue, and less non-Trucking services revenue, led to the decline in total revenue.\nOperations and maintenance expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 6.8% in 2016 and 2015. Operations and maintenance expense consists of direct operating expense, equipment maintenance, and tire expense. Operations and maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, decreased to 7.4% in 2016 from 7.6% in 2015, due to improved cost control measures. Direct operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, in 2016 due to lower operating supply costs and drayage related operating costs. We continue to experience tight driver market conditions, and we expect the driver market to remain competitive in 2017, which could negatively affect our recruiting costs.\nWe primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers in our Trucking segment or arranging for the transportation of customer freight by third-party capacity providers in our Logistics segment. Our total revenue is reported under \"Results of Operations\" under Item 7 to Part II of this Annual Report and categorized as (i) Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge, (ii) Trucking fuel surcharge revenue, and (iii) Logistics revenue. Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge, and Trucking fuel surcharge revenue are largely generated by the Trucking services provided by our three Trucking operating units (Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage), whereas Logistics revenue is mostly generated by the logistics services provided by our two Logistics operating units (Brokerage and Intermodal). We also provide logistics, freight management, sourcing, and other non-Trucking services, such as used equipment sales and leasing to independent contractors and third-parties through our Logistics business.\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage Change in\nDollar

(2) Long-term debt of $18.0 million is borrowings under our line of credit, which has a maturity date of August 2019. We expect to pay-off the debt balance prior to the final maturity date. (3) Investment commitments primarily consist of contractual obligations to investments in various Transportation Resource Partnerships, which are subject to capital calls. The expected timing of the capital calls is presented above. \nWe provide for income taxes at the statutory federal and state rates, adjusted for permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting. Our effective tax rate was 38.0% for 2016 and 36.8% for 2015. The unusually low rate in 2015 was attributable to favorable tax positions taken on amended federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and other miscellaneous non-recurring decreases, which positively impacted our net income by approximately $5.4 million.\nOur capital expenditures can also affect depreciation expense. Trucking depreciation relates primarily to our owned tractors, trailers, ELDs and other communication units, and other similar assets. Changes to this fixed cost are generally attributed to increases or decreases to company-owned equipment and fluctuations in new equipment purchase prices, which have historically been precipitated in part by new or proposed federal and state regulations (such as the EPA engine emissions requirements relating to post-2014 model tractors and the California trailer efficiency requirements). Depreciation can also be affected by the cost of used equipment that we sell or trade and the replacement of older used equipment. Our management periodically reviews the condition, average age, and reasonableness of estimated useful lives and salvage values of our equipment and considers such factors in light of our experience with similar assets, used equipment market conditions, and prevailing industry practice. Total Trucking segment depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $111.7 million in 2016.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logistics\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 226,912\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 249,365\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 214,378\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Intersegment transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9,122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (18,336\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,105\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue excluding intersegment transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 217,790\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 231,029\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 210,273\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 214,662\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 233,508\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 199,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Intersegment transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9,122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (18,336\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,105\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses excluding intersegment transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 205,540\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 94.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 215,172\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 93.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 194,975\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,857\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,298\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 year or\nless\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,041\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,041\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment commitments(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,740\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,038\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,870\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases -

Our Adjusted Operating Ratio (total operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge, as a percentage of total revenue, before fuel surcharge), was 85.6% in 2016, compared to 83.2% in 2015. Please see the reconciliation table above for a reconciliation of GAAP operating ratio to Adjusted Operating Ratio.\n\nNet interest and other income, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 0.4% in 2016 from 0.8% in 2015. Other income includes realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities and unrealized gains from our investments in TRP investments that use the equity method of accounting. Our realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities were lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to fewer securities sold during 2016. We repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock in 2016 for $39.9 million, and interest expense decreased in 2016 because of the decreased average borrowing during the year. Our debt balance decreased to $18.0 million at December 31, 2016 from $112.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $243.4 million, $205.8 million, and $177.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase for 2016 is primarily due to lower income tax payments made in 2016, as we depleted the large income tax receivable balance on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015.\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of income in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue and the percentage increase or decrease in the dollar amounts of those items compared to the prior year (dollars in thousands).\nLogistics Strategy and Segment Information\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nOperating Revenue\n\n (1) Purchased transportation expense is comprised of (a) payments to independent contractors, which are primarily attributed to our Trucking segment; (b) payments to third-party capacity providers, which are primarily attributed to our Logistics segment; and (c) payments relating to our logistics, freight management and non-Trucking services. Purchased transportation expense is further discussed in the year-to-year comparison of operating results below. \nThe primary measures we use to evaluate the profitability of our Trucking segment are operating ratio, measured on a GAAP basis (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of revenue), and Adjusted Operating Ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure (operating expenses, net of Trucking fuel surcharge revenue, expressed as a percentage of Trucking revenue, excluding Trucking fuel surcharge revenue). We believe the use of Adjusted Operating Ratio allows us to more effectively compare periods, while excluding the potentially volatile effect of changes in fuel prices. The Board and management focus on our Adjusted Operating Ratio as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of Adjusted Operating Ratio is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance.\nTrucking Strategy and Segment Information\n (1) These items represent non-GAAP financial measures and are not substitutes for, and should be considered in addition to, the GAAP financial measures presented in the previous table. \nNet cash from financing activities typically varies with borrowing activity on our line of credit. In 2016 and 2015, we had net payments to our line of credit of $94.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively, while in 2014, we had net proceeds from borrowing on our line of credit of $96.4 million to fund the purchase of Barr-Nunn. Exercises of stock options and repurchases of our common stock also contributed to the changes in cash used or provided by financing activities during the three years ended December 31, 2016. We repurchased $39.9 million of our common stock on the open market in 2016, and $45.3 million in 2015, while we did not repurchase any of our common stock in 2014. Proceeds from exercises of stock options were $13.2 million, $9.9 million, and $24.4 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We returned $19.6 million, $19.9 million, and $19.6 million to our shareholders by way of dividends in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nOur liquidity is not materially affected by off-balance sheet transactions. See the discussion under \"Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\" under Item 7 to Part II of this Annual Report for a description of our off-balance sheet transactions.\nThe factors below should be considered when comparing our results of operations in 2016 to our results of operations in 2015. Our 2016 results included:\nOur Trucking operating strategy is to achieve a high level of asset utilization within a highly disciplined operating system, while maintaining strict controls over our cost structure. To achieve these goals, we operate primarily in high-density, predictable freight lanes in select geographic regions and attempt to develop and expand our customer base around each of our service centers by providing multiple truckload services for each customer. This operating strategy allows us to take advantage of the large amount of freight transported in regional markets. Our service centers enable us to better serve our customers and work more closely with our driving associates. We operate a premium modern fleet to appeal to drivers and customers, reduce maintenance expenses and driver and equipment downtime, and enhance our fuel and other operating efficiencies. We employ technology in a cost-effective manner to assist us in controlling operating costs and enhancing revenue.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies:\nRecent Consolidated Results of Operations and Year-End Financial Condition\nThe following table sets forth the Trucking segment Adjusted Operating Ratio as if fuel surcharges are excluded from total revenue and instead reported as a reduction of operation expenses, excluding intersegment transactions (dollars in thousands).\nWe currently maintain a line of credit that permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit up to an aggregate of $300.0 million and matures on August 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount outstanding under our line of credit was $18.0 million, which is classified as a long-term liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We also utilized a portion of our line of credit for letters of credit, which are issued to various regulatory authorities and insurance carriers in connection with our self-insurance programs. The issued but unused letters of credit totaled $31.3 million as of December 31, 2016 and $27.4 million as of December 31, 2015. Combining the amounts borrowed and letters of credit issued, we had $250.7 million available for future borrowing under our existing line of credit as of December 31, 2016, compared to $160.6 million as of December 31, 2015. Under our current line of credit agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain financial and other covenants and were in compliance with those covenants as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nAdjusted Operating Ratio is not a substitute for operating ratio measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Although we believe that Adjusted Operating Ratio improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define Adjusted Operating Ratio differently. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Operating Ratio should not be considered a measure of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nIn addition to estimates within our self-insured retention, we also must make judgments concerning our coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. Currently, we are not aware of any such claims. If one or more claims were to exceed our effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a result of the above factors, our GAAP operating ratio (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue) was 85.0% for 2015, compared to 85.2% for 2014. Our Adjusted Operating Ratio (total operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge, as a percentage of revenue, before fuel surcharge), was 83.2% in 2015, compared to 82.4% in 2014. Please see the reconciliation table above for a reconciliation of GAAP operating ratio to Adjusted Operating Ratio.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nLogistics revenue is primarily generated by the Brokerage and Intermodal operating units. Logistics revenue was $217.8 million in 2016 compared to $231.0 million in 2015. Logistics revenue decreased primarily due to declining revenue from our non-Trucking services as we exited our agricultural sourcing business in the first quarter of 2016, as well as due to lower revenue per load because of lower fuel surcharge. Revenue in our Brokerage business, which is the largest component of our Logistics segment, decreased in 2016 compared to 2015; however, we continued to see load volume growth. A shorter length of haul and lower non-contract pricing offset this load volume growth. We achieved this growth by providing more capacity to our customers through our third-party carriers and rail providers.\nWe have created a service network with financial accountability, a modern tractor fleet, access to thousands of third-party capacity transportation providers, and the capability of providing multiple transportation service offerings and modes to customers in North America. We believe our operating strategies are contributing factors to our revenue and earnings growth over time.\n\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 28.2% in 2015 from 24.7% in 2014. Costs associated with healthcare benefits provided to our employees and accruals for workers' compensation benefits are components of our salaries, wages and benefits expense in our consolidated statements of income. Factors contributing to the increase include increases in driver base pay, and a shift from purchased transportation expense to driver salaries and wages expense, as a greater percentage of our tractor fleet was comprised of company tractors rather than independent contractors. Our non-driver personnel salaries and wages increased, as did our payroll taxes and costs associated with benefits provided, as we increased our number of employees, particularly in our Logistics segment. We improved our pay and performance bonus for our driving associates in 2015 in response to an increasingly challenging driver market.\nA tax benefit or liability from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.\nOur Logistics segment is less asset-intensive and is instead dependent upon capable non-driver personnel, modern and effective information technology, and qualified third-party capacity providers. The most significant expense of our Logistics segment, which is primarily variable, is the cost of purchased transportation that we pay to third-party capacity providers (including rail providers), which is included in the \"Purchased transportation\" line of our consolidated statements of income. This expense generally varies depending upon truckload and rail capacity, availability of third-party capacity providers, rates charged to customers, and current freight demand and customer shipping needs. Other Logistics operating expenses are generally fixed and primarily include the compensation and benefits of non-driver personnel (included in the \"Salaries, wages and benefits\" line of our consolidated statements of income) and depreciation and amortization expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 9.4% for 2015 from 8.4% in 2014, primarily because of the decrease in fuel surcharge revenue. As a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, depreciation and amortization increased to 10.5% in 2015 from 10.0% in 2014, as our Trucking revenue growth outpaced revenue growth in our Logistics segment, which is less capital intensive. A greater percentage of our tractor fleet was comprised of company-owned tractors rather than tractors provided by independent contractors, and we experienced higher equipment prices. Depreciation and amortization expense for our Trucking segment, as a percentage of Trucking revenue, was 12.9% in 2015 and 12.3% in 2014. The increased expense is primarily related to the increased number of tractors and trailers owned during 2015. The increased expense was partially offset by higher average revenue per tractor. The majority of our company-owned tractor fleet is comprised of tractors with 2014 compliant engines, which are more expensive than previous tractors due to compliance with NHTSA and EPA emissions standards.\nInsurance and claims expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased slightly to 2.9% in 2015, from 2.8% in 2014. Insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenue, before fuel surcharge, decreased to 3.2% in 2015 from 3.4% in 2014, and decreased slightly on a per mile basis, year-over-year. Insurance and claims expense consists of premiums for liability, physical damage, and cargo, and will vary based upon the frequency and severity of claims, as well as our level of self-insurance, and premium expense.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $8.0 million, compared to $8.7 million as of December 31, 2015. During the next twelve months and beyond, we believe that we will be able to finance our short-term needs for working capital and acquisitions of revenue equipment with cash, cash flows from operations, and financing available under our existing line of credit. We expect to have significant capital requirements over the long-term, which may require us to incur additional debt or seek additional equity capital. The availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions, the market price of our common stock, our financial condition and results of operations, and several other factors over which we have limited control. Nevertheless, based on our recent operating results, current cash position, anticipated future cash flows, and sources of available financing, we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nCommunications expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 0.4% for 2016 and 2015. Communications expense is comprised of costs associated with our tractor and trailer tracking systems, information technology systems, and phone systems.\n (1) Gross margin percentage is based on Logistics revenue and purchased transportation net of intersegment transactions. \n\nSince our Logistics segment depends on effective usage of information systems and technology that enable us to efficiently arrange for the transportation of our customers' freight and remain resourceful and responsive in meeting customer shipping needs. As our Logistics services evolve, we may incur costs to upgrade, integrate, or expand our information systems and technology, but we do not expect that costs for such improvements will require significant capital expenditures in the future. Total Logistics segment depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $4.4 million in 2016, which is primarily attributed to equipment leased to third parties.\nTotal revenue increased 7.3% for 2015 to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion for 2014, generally because of increased tractor productivity and average revenue per loaded mile in our Trucking segment and shipment volume growth in our Logistics segment.\nThe following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016, our contractual obligations and payments due by corresponding period for our short- and long-term operating expenses and other commitments (amounts in thousands).\n\nBeginning in 2014, we issued performance restricted stock units ( PRSUs\u201d), to selected key employees, that may be earned based on achieving performance targets approved by our compensation committee annually. The initial award is subject to an adjustment determined by our performance achieved over a three-year performance period when compared to the objective performance standards adopted by the Compensation Committee; this adjustment ranges from 0 percent to 150 percent of the initial amount of the grant. A further adjustment is made based on our total shareholder return compared to a peer group approved by our Compensation Committee. This adjustment ranges from 75 percent to 125 percent of the award after adjustment for our performance. Furthermore, the PRSUs have additional service requirements subsequent to the achievement of the performance targets. PRSUs do not earn dividend equivalents. The fair value of each PRSU grant is estimated on the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model. Compensation expense is recognized straight-line over the requisite service period based on management's estimated probability of the performance targets being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date.\nOperating Expenses\nThe growth of our business has required, and will continue to require, significant investments. In our Trucking business, where investments are substantial, the primary investments are in new tractors and trailers and, to a lesser extent, in technology, service centers, and working capital. In our Logistics business, where investments are modest, the primary investments are in technology and working capital. Our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and borrowings under our line of credit.\nEffectively controlling our expenses is an important element of maximizing our profitability. The most significant expenses of our Trucking segment are primarily variable and include fuel and fuel taxes, driver-related expenses (such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment) and costs associated with independent contractors (which are primarily included in purchased transportation expense recorded on the \"Purchased transportation\" line of our consolidated statements of income). Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance expense (which includes costs for replacement tires for our revenue equipment) and our total cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency, and other factors. The main fixed costs for our Trucking segment are the acquisition and depreciation of long-term assets (such as revenue equipment and service centers) and the compensation of non-driver personnel.\nIntroduction\nOperating Expenses\nWe primarily measure the Logistics segment's profitability by reviewing the gross margin percentage (revenue net of intersegment transactions, less purchased transportation expense, net of intersegment transactions, expressed as a percentage of revenue net of intersegment transactions) and the operating ratio. The gross margin percentage can be affected by customer rates and the costs of securing third-party capacity providers. Our third-party capacity providers are generally not subject to long-term or predetermined contracted rates, and our operating results could be affected if the availability of third-party capacity providers or the rates for such providers change in the future. The following table lists the gross margin percentage for our Brokerage and Intermodal businesses combined.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n (1) Average revenue per tractor is based on Trucking revenue, net of intersegment transactions, and does not include fuel surcharge revenue. \nWe offer a broad range of full truckload transportation and logistics services with one of North America's largest tractor fleets, operated through a nationwide network of service centers, and contractual access to thousands of third-party capacity providers. We have grown substantially by increasing the geographic reach of our service center network and by expanding the breadth of our services for customers. Our Trucking segment provides truckload transportation, including dedicated services, of various products, goods, and materials for our diverse customer base through our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operating units. The Brokerage and Intermodal operating units of our Logistics segment provide a multitude of shipment solutions, including additional sources of truckload capacity and alternative transportation modes, by utilizing our vast network of third-party capacity providers and rail providers, as well as certain logistics, freight management, and other non-Trucking services. Our objective is to operate our Trucking and Logistics businesses with industry-leading margins and growth, while providing safe, high-quality, cost-effective solutions for our customers.\nLogistics revenue is primarily generated by the Brokerage and Intermodal operating units. Logistics revenue was $231.0 million in 2015 and $210.3 million in 2014. We achieved the increase in revenue by providing more capacity to our customers through our third-party carriers and rail providers. Shipment volume growth in our Brokerage business, which is the largest component of our Logistics segment, increased 47.9% in 2015 compared to 2014, as we continued to increase our buyer pool, which lead to increased access to third-party capacity. Although our revenue per load was negatively affected in 2015 as a result of lower fuel surcharge, a shorter length of haul, and fewer non-contract opportunities, we continued to expand gross margins.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nWhen evaluating Trucking revenue, we consider the following key operating statistics for each period: (i) average revenue per tractor; (ii) average length of haul (miles with loaded trailer cargo); (iii) average percentage of non-paid empty miles (miles without trailer cargo); and (iv) average number of tractors and trailers in operation. The following table sets forth certain key operating statistics and certain other statistical data of the Trucking segment for the indicated periods (dollars in thousands).\nAs a result of the preceding factors, our net income attributable to Knight Transportation increased to 9.9%, compared to 9.3% in 2014.\nProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment is depreciated to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life, which ranges from one to thirty years. Salvage values range from zero to 25% of the capitalized cost. We periodically review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets based upon, among other things, our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and prevailing industry practice. We both routinely and periodically review and make a determination whether the salvage value of our tractors and trailers is higher or lower than originally expected. This determination is based upon (i) market conditions in equipment sales, (ii) the guaranteed repurchase price with contracted dealerships, and (iii) the average miles driven on the equipment being sold. Future changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates, or fluctuation in market value not reflected in our estimates, could have a material effect on our results of operations. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances for indications that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, we compare the carrying value of our assets to the fair value to determine if any impairment exists. In the event that the carrying value exceeds the fair market value, we will adjust the property and equipment to the fair value and recognize any impairment loss. Our assets classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or net selling value.\nWe expect to continue to utilize the flexibility of our model to react and adapt to market conditions. We believe we can optimize our model and refine our execution in reaction to, or in anticipation of, transportation market dynamics, particularly the markets for truckload and logistics services that we offer. We plan to continue to evaluate additional strategic acquisitions to supplement our growth.\nItem 7, as well as other items of this Annual Report, contains certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and such statements are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical or current fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including without limitation: any projections of earnings, revenues, cash flows, dividends, capital expenditures, or other financial items; any statement of plans, strategies, and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed acquisition plans, new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; and any statements of belief and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. In this Item 7, statements relating to the ability of our infrastructure to support future growth, the flexibility of our model to adapt to market conditions, our ability to recruit and retain qualified drivers, our ability to react to market conditions, our ability to gain market share, future tractor prices, potential acquisitions, our equipment purchasing plans and equipment turnover, the expected freight environment and economic trends, whether we grow organically, our ability to obtain favorable pricing terms from vendors and suppliers, expected liquidity and methods for achieving sufficient liquidity, future fuel prices, future third-party service provider relationships and availability, future compensation arrangements with independent contractors and drivers, our expected need or desire to incur indebtedness, expected sources of liquidity for capital expenditures and allocation of capital, expected tractor trade-ins, expected sources of working capital and funds for acquiring revenue equipment, expected capital expenditures, future asset utilization, future capital requirements, future trucking capacity, future consumer spending, expected freight demand and volumes, future rates, future depreciation and amortization, expected tractor and trailer fleet age, regulatory changes and the impact thereof, and future purchased transportation expense, among others, are forward-looking statements. Such statements may be identified by their use of terms or phrases such as \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"projects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" \"hopes,\" and similar terms and phrases. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available operating, financial, and competitive information. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, which could cause future events and actual results to differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by, or underlying the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" set forth above. Readers should review and consider the factors discussed in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" along with various disclosures in our press releases, shareholder reports, and other filings with the SEC.\nPurchased transportation expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 20.9% for 2016 and 2015. Purchased transportation expense is comprised of (i) payments to independent contractors for our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operations in our Trucking segment; (ii) payments to third-party capacity providers for our Brokerage operations and to railroads for our Intermodal operations; and (iii) payments relating to logistics freight management, and non-Trucking services in our Logistics segment. The overall decrease in this category is primarily due to lower fuel surcharge equivalent payments to independent contractors and third-party capacity providers. Purchased transportation costs generally take into account changes in diesel fuel prices, resulting in lower payments during periods of declining fuel prices. Purchased transportation expense within our Logistics segment decreased as expected with the decrease in Logistics revenue, but this decrease was hindered by increased costs associated with exiting our agriculture sourcing business in the first quarter of 2016. We expect purchased transportation will increase as a percentage of total revenue, if we are successful in continuing to grow our Logistics segment.\nAll such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in the events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nAs a result of the preceding factors, our net income attributable to Knight Transportation decreased to 8.4%, compared to 9.9% in 2015.\nWe provide for income taxes at the statutory federal and state rates, adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting. Our effective tax rate was 36.8% for 2015 and 39.7% for 2014. The unusually low rate in 2015 was attributable to favorable tax positions taken on amended federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and other miscellaneous non-recurring decreases, that positively affected our net income by approximately $5.4 million.\nLogistics revenue is generated primarily by our Brokerage and Intermodal operating units. We also provide logistics, freight management and other non-Trucking services to our customers through our Logistics business. We are generally paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for arranging freight transportation for our customers and providing other Logistics services. Additional revenue is generated by offering specialized logistics solutions (including, but not limited to, origin management, surge volumes, disaster relief, special projects, and other logistics needs). Our Logistics revenue is mainly affected by the rates we obtain from customers, the freight volumes we ship through our third-party capacity providers, and our ability to secure qualified third-party capacity providers to transport customer freight. Increases in shipments serviced by our Brokerage and Intermodal operating units and continued increases in the number of customers utilizing our Logistics services contributed to the improved productivity realized in 2016. We were able to provide Logistics services to our existing customers as well as effectively expand to new customers in 2016.\nManagement judgment is also required regarding a variety of other factors including the appropriateness of tax strategies, expected future tax consequences based on our future performance, and our likelihood of success in the event that tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities. We utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall income taxes. It is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed, resulting in an increased liability for income taxes. Significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs. An ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCommunications expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 0.4% for 2015 and 2014. Communications expense is comprised of our tractor and trailer tracking systems, information technology systems, and phone systems.\nInsurance and claims expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 3.1% in 2016, from 2.9% in 2015. Insurance and claims expense as a percentage of total revenue, excluding fuel surcharge, increased slightly to 3.3% in 2016 from 3.2% in 2015, and increased slightly on a per mile basis, year-over-year. The increase was partly due to the decrease in total revenue in 2016 from 2015, combined with slightly higher premium costs and changes in the severity of claims. Insurance and claims expense consists of premiums for liability, physical damage, and cargo, and will vary based upon the frequency and severity of claims, as well as our level of self-insurance, and premium expense.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur 2015 results included:\nTrucking revenue is generated by our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operating units. Generally, we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our Trucking services. Additional revenues are generated by charging for tractor and trailer detention, loading and unloading activities, dedicated services, and other specialized services, as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel. The main factors that affect our Trucking revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, and the number of loaded miles we generate with our equipment.\nThe following table sets forth the Logistics segment revenue, operating expenses, and operating income (dollars in thousands).\nTrends and Outlook\nIn 2016, we generated $243.4 million in cash flow from operations and used $89.0 million for capital expenditures, net of equipment sales. During 2016, we returned $59.5 million to our shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and stock repurchases. We ended the year with $8.0 million of cash, $18.0 million of long-term debt, and $786.5 million of shareholders' equity.\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $101.0 million, $138.3 million, and $266.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The higher investment total in 2014 is due to the acquisition of Barr-Nunn in the fourth quarter of 2014 for approximately $110.5 million total consideration. Excluding the Barr-Nunn acquisition, capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment (net of equipment sales and trade-ins), office equipment, and land and leasehold improvements totaled $89.0 million, $149.4 million, and $178.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in 2016 is due to our decision to limit organic fleet expansion and extend the expected trade cycle of our tractors in response to a challenging freight market and soft used equipment market. Excluding any acquisitions, we currently anticipate capital expenditures, net of trade-ins, of approximately $95.0 million to $110.0 million for 2017. We expect to use our capital expenditure estimate primarily to acquire new revenue equipment for replacement and not fleet growth.\nOur liquidity is not materially affected by off-balance sheet transactions. Like many other transportation companies, we have periodically utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment requirements and terminal facilities requirements. We lease revenue equipment under non-cancellable operating leases, and we lease some of our service centers and temporary trailer storage under non-cancellable operating leases. Operating lease expense for such equipment, facilities and trailer storage is reflected in the \"Miscellaneous operating expenses\" line in our consolidated statements of income, and totaled $5.0 million, $4.7 million, and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nResults of Operations\n \u25cf Total revenue decreased 5.5%, to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion; \u25cf Net income attributable to Knight Transportation decreased 19.6%, to $93.9 million from $116.7 million; and \u25cf Net earnings attributable to Knight Transportation per diluted share decreased 18.4%, to $1.16 from $1.42. \nDepreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 10.4% for 2016 from 9.4% in 2015, in part due to the decrease in fuel surcharge revenue. As a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, depreciation and amortization increased to 11.3% in 2016 from 10.5% in 2015. This increase was due to a combination of the decrease in revenue, before fuel surcharge, driven by the decrease in average revenue per tractor in our Trucking segment, and the decrease in revenue from our less asset-intensive Logistics segment, driven by the decrease in revenue per load and reduced non-Trucking service revenue. Depreciation and amortization expense for our Trucking segment, as a percentage of Trucking revenue, was 13.8% in 2016, compared to 12.9% in 2015. Factors contributing to the increase were the decrease in average revenue per tractor, rising new equipment prices, and an increase in our tractor to trailer ratio. Absent offsetting improvements in average revenue per tractor or growth in our Logistics operations, our expense as a percentage of revenue in this category could increase in the future. With rising equipment prices, and a continuing soft used equipment market, we have extended the expected trade cycle for our tractors, which is expected to reduce capital expenditures and restrict higher depreciation and amortization costs in the future. In implementing the extended trade cycle, we have been proactive in managing our preventative maintenance program with a goal of mitigating the additional maintenance cost commonly associated with a slightly older fleet.\nShare-Based Payments. We have stock options outstanding under our stock compensation plan. Exercises are permitted in pre-determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant. Each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant; expiration will not exceed ten years from the date of the grant. The calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments. These estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of our stock options is expensed on a straight-line basis, which generally ranges between five to seven years. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero-coupon Treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option. Management judgment is required to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model; management bases those decisions on historical data. The expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share-based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding.\nConsolidated Revenue and Expenses\nIn 2017, we expect the freight environment to continue to be challenging until capacity begins to tighten as a result of low new tractor orders, a weak demand for used equipment, and additional regulatory burdens expected to phase in over the coming quarters. We expect the environment to become more favorable in the second half of the year, as we believe capacity will continue to exit the market and pricing will respond positively. Market factors that include higher driver wages, lower gain on sale of revenue equipment, and fewer non-contract opportunities may negatively affect our margins in our Trucking and Logistics segments. In this environment, we plan to limit organic fleet expansion, focus on cost control, grow revenues in our Logistics segment, and continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities.\nTrucking revenue, net of fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, was $810.4 million in 2016 compared to $830.7 million in 2015. Trucking fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $89.9 million in 2016 from $121.2 million in 2015, as fuel prices were consistently lower during 2016 compared to 2015. We increased average miles per tractor 1.4% in 2016, compared to 2015. However, this improvement was offset by a decrease in average revenue per loaded mile by 1.5%, and an increase in non-paid empty mile percentage rate to 12.5% from 12.0%. This negatively affected our tractor productivity, as measured by average annual Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge, per tractor, which decreased by 0.7% in 2016, compared to 2015. If economic conditions improve and capacity tightens, we anticipate that we will be able to obtain rate increases in 2017 and beyond; however, adverse changes in these factors could either prevent rate increases or negatively affect existing rates.\nNet interest and other income, as a percentage of revenue, remained constant at 0.8% in 2015, and 2014. Other income included realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities and unrealized gains from our investments in TRP III using the equity method of accounting. Our realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities were higher in 2015, compared to 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we funded the acquisition of Barr-Nunn for approximately $112.4 million with borrowings from our existing line of credit. We repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock in 2015 for $45.3 million, and interest expense increased in 2015 because of the increased average borrowing during the year. Our debt balance decreased to $112.0 million at December 31, 2015, from $134.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nOperating taxes and licenses expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 1.6% in 2016 and 2015. This expense line item is impacted by changes in various fuel tax rates and registration fees associated with our tractor fleet and regional operating facilities.\nFactors that affect our results of operations are industry-wide economic factors, such as freight demand, truckload and rail intermodal capacity, fuel prices, inventory levels, industrial production, government regulation, and unemployment rates, as well as our capital allocation, sales and marketing, operating, and spending decisions. We measure our results through key metrics, such as the number of tractors we operate, our revenue per tractor (which includes primarily our revenue per total mile and our number of miles per tractor), freight volumes brokered to third-party capacity providers (including our rail partners), driver and independent contractor recruitment and retention, and our ability to control costs on a company-wide basis, as measured by cost per mile in our Trucking segment and non-GAAP operating ratio ( Adjusted Operating Ratio\u201d) in both segments. Please see the reconciliation table below for a reconciliation of GAAP operating ratio to Adjusted Operating Ratio. Our success depends on our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our resources in providing transportation and logistics solutions to our customers in light of such factors. We evaluate the growth opportunities for each of our Trucking and Logistics businesses based on customer demand and supply chain trends, availability of drivers and third-party capacity providers, expected returns on invested capital, expected net cash flows, and our company-specific capabilities.\nIn 2016, our Trucking segment operated an average of 4,706 tractors, a decrease of 87 tractors from a year ago. Asset utilization, as measured by average miles per tractor, improved 1.4% in 2016 compared to 2015, while productivity, as measured by average annual revenue per tractor, before fuel surcharge, decreased 0.7% in 2016. Our Trucking segment achieved an operating ratio of 84.9% and an Adjusted Operating Ratio of 83.2% in 2016, compared to an Adjusted Operating Ratio of 80.5% in 2015. Higher net fuel expense, less gain on sale of revenue equipment, and higher driver-related expenses were the main factors negatively affecting our 2016 operating results when compared to the prior year. Shipments serviced by our Logistics segment increased as we continued to increase our Logistics services customers, and to expand our third-party carrier network. However, revenues in our Logistics segment decreased 5.7% in 2016, compared to 2015, due to a decrease in revenue per load.\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements set forth beginning at page of this report for discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nTrucking revenue increased to $830.7 million in 2015 from $715.7 million in 2014. Trucking fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $121.2 million in 2015 from $176.3 million in 2014, as fuel prices declined in each quarter of 2015. Tractor productivity, as measured by average annual Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge per tractor, increased in 2015, compared to 2014. This was attributable to improved contract pricing. Average revenue per loaded mile increased 4.2%, as we improved pricing, but was partially offset by an increase in non-paid empty mile percentage rate to 12.0% from 10.1%.\nThe following table sets forth the Logistics revenue, operating expenses, and operating income, excluding intersegment transactions (dollars in thousands).\nSeveral issues affecting the trucking industry could also cause our costs to increase in future periods. These issues include driver and independent contractor availability, fuel price fluctuations, increases to new tractor and trailer purchase prices, and changes in federal and state regulations. From a cost perspective, recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers, independent contractors, and third-party capacity providers may become increasingly costly; equipment prices may continue to rise, medical, workers' compensation, and litigation expenses are increasing more rapidly than general inflation, and potentially higher fuel prices may not be fully offset by fuel surcharges. In the current economic and regulatory environments, it will be important to allocate equipment to more profitable shipments, use technology to generate efficiencies, continue to grow our Logistics segment, and effectively manage costs. We believe we have the service center network, modern tractor fleet, comprehensive truckload and logistics services, management team and qualified personnel, technology, intense focus on cost control, and capital resources necessary to successfully overcome these challenges and capitalize on future opportunities.\nOperating Revenue\nBusiness Overview\nFuel expense decreased, as a percentage of total revenue, to 11.6% in 2016, from 12.9% in 2015, as the U.S. National Average Diesel Fuel price decreased by 14.9% in 2016. Fuel expense, net of Trucking fuel surcharge, expressed as a percentage of Trucking revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, increased to 4.9% in 2016, from 3.8% in 2015. Our fuel surcharge program helps to offset increases in fuel prices, but applies only to loaded miles and typically does not offset non-paid empty miles, idle time, and out of route miles driven. Typical fuel surcharge programs involve a computation based on the change in national or regional fuel prices. These programs may update as often as weekly, but typically require a specified minimum change in fuel cost to prompt a change in Trucking fuel surcharge revenue. Therefore, many of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when the change is reflected in Trucking fuel surcharge revenue. Due to this time lag, our fuel expense, net of fuel surcharge, negatively affects our operating income during periods of sharply rising fuel costs and positively affects our operating income during periods of falling fuel costs. Fuel prices were falling throughout 2015 and bottomed out in the first quarter of 2016, before rising in each of the remaining quarters of 2016. We expect fuel expense will continue to increase during the first part of 2017. We continue to utilize fuel efficiency initiatives, such as trailer blades, idle-control, more fuel-efficient engines, and driver training programs that we believe will help to control our fuel expense.\nOur Trucking segment requires substantial capital expenditures for purchases of new revenue equipment. We fund these purchases with cash flows from operations and financing available under our existing line of credit. We operated an average of 4,706 tractors in 2016, of which 4,286 were company-owned tractors. The average age of our company-owned tractor fleet was 1.9 years at December 31, 2016, which we expect to increase slightly in 2017. We also operated an average of 12,288 trailers in 2016, with an average age of 4.4 years as of December 31, 2016. We expect the average age of our trailers to remain relatively constant in 2017. Our net property and equipment at December 31, 2016 was $802.9 million, most of which relates to our Trucking segment.\nSalaries, wages and benefits expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 29.9% in 2016 from 28.2% in 2015. Costs associated with healthcare benefits provided to our employees and accruals for workers' compensation benefits are components of our salaries, wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income. The primary reason for the increase is attributable to lower total revenue in 2016 compared to 2015, as the dollar expense remained relatively flat. Additional factors affecting this expense included further increases to driver base pay during 2016, and a shift from driver pay to purchased transportation expense, as more of our fleet was comprised of independent contractors in 2016 compared to 2015. We believe that the driver market remains challenging and that several ongoing market factors, including the CSA implementation of stricter regulations, has further reduced the pool of available drivers. We expect that driver pay will continue to be inflationary on a year-over-year basis. Having a sufficient number of qualified driving associates continues to be a major concern, although we continue to seek ways to attract and retain qualified driving associates, including investing in technology and service centers that improve the experience of drivers.\n\nOur consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, were as follows:\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nClaims Accrual. Reserves are established based on estimated or expected losses for claims. The primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability, personal injury, property damage, collision, comprehensive, workers' compensation, and employee medical expenses. We maintain self-insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self-insured liabilities. We also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self-insurance amounts. The reserves are analyzed quarterly and represent accruals for the estimated self-insured portion of pending claims, including adverse development of known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, the facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. We have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability would be adversely affected.\nPurchased transportation expense, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased to 20.9% for 2015 from 21.6% for 2014. Purchased transportation expense is comprised of (i) payments to independent contractors for our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operations in our Trucking segment; and (ii) payments to third-party capacity providers for our Brokerage operations and to railroads for our Intermodal operations; and (iii) payments relating to logistics freight management, and non-Trucking services in our Logistics segment. The overall decrease in this category is primarily due to lower fuel surcharge equivalent payments to independent contractors and third-party capacity providers, a smaller percentage of our miles being operated by independent contractors, and the growth in our larger Trucking segment operations, which grew revenues by 16.1% in 2015. Purchased transportation expense attributed to payments to third-party capacity providers (including railroads and sourcing activities) in our Logistics segment increased 10.4% in 2015, when compared to 2014. Purchased transportation costs generally take into account changes in diesel fuel prices, resulting in lower payments during periods of declining fuel prices.\nWe have service and performance-based restricted stock awards outstanding. Our compensation expense is based on fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 under which we estimate the expense.", "item_7_text": "Our gross margin percentage remained consistent in 2016 from 2015, but our operating margin contracted. The primary reason for the operating margin contraction was lower revenue per load.\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nOver the medium- to long-term, we believe capacity in the truckload market will be constrained by an increasingly competitive driver market, elevated regulatory costs for trucking companies and drivers, and potentially alternative employment opportunities for drivers we wish to hire. These factors are expected generally to have a positive impact on industry-wide rate structures. However, reduced hours of operation and driver shortages could negatively affect equipment utilization, even in a stronger demand environment. In such an environment, we believe carriers that are well-positioned to develop and retain drivers, withstand supply and demand fluctuations, and provide safe, dependable, and high-quality service to customers will have opportunities to increase freight rates and market share. We believe domestic and global economic and political conditions present the most direct challenges to improved freight demand. These threats include fluctuations in commodity prices, an inability of the United States government to timely and adequately address fiscal issues, currency fluctuations, or other factors outside our control could reduce consumer spending or industrial investment, thus negatively affecting freight volumes. In addition, the competitive landscape and the supply chains of our customers are constantly shifting based on manufacturing and transportation costs, business combinations, inventory levels, and other factors.\nMiscellaneous operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased slightly to 2.0% in 2016, from 1.9% for 2015. The increase is due in part to the decrease in Trucking fuel surcharge revenue, and less gain on sale of equipment to offset these costs. However, in both 2016 and 2015, we recorded infrequent expenses ($2.5 million pretax ($1.5 million after tax), and $7.2 million pretax ($4.4 million after tax)) respectively, relating to expected settlement costs for class action lawsuits involving employment-related claims in California and Oregon. Excluding these infrequent expenses, and excluding the effect of the decrease in the fuel surcharge component of total revenue, and lower gain on sale of equipment, miscellaneous operating expenses decreased due to decreased legal expense associated with the prior year infrequent claim expense, and decreased costs associated with technology and our management information systems. Gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses and decreased to $8.1 million in 2016, from $15.3 million in 2015, as a result of a soft used equipment resale market prevalent in 2016. We believe the used equipment market will continue to help offset other miscellaneous operating expenses, but not to the extent as it did in prior years, as the used equipment market softened beginning in the third quarter of 2015 and we expect a similar environment through the first half of 2017.\nTotal revenue and net income decreased in 2016, compared to 2015. The freight environment was more challenging in 2016 compared to 2015, but modestly improved as the year progressed. We attribute the change to excess trucking capacity in the markets we serve, and fewer non-contract opportunities that reduced our revenue per loaded mile. However, we sustained improvement in our asset utilization and experienced more favorable freight conditions toward the end of the year. In this environment, we diligently focused our efforts on cost control and continued to seek operational efficiencies, while providing industry-leading service.\nThe total revenue and operating expenses of our Trucking and Logistics segments are similarly affected by certain factors that generally relate to, among other things, overall economic and weather conditions in the United States, customer inventory levels, specific customer demand, the levels of truckload and rail intermodal capacity, and availability of qualified drivers, independent contractors, and third-party capacity providers. See the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d set forth above, along with various disclosures in our press releases, shareholder reports, and other filings with the SEC.\nIn 2016, we experienced a challenging freight environment and although we made improvements in miles per tractor, we continued to experience excess trucking capacity in the markets we serve, which led to a more competitive pricing market and fewer non-contract opportunities that pressured our revenue per loaded mile. The market began to improve in the second half of the year and a more typical, but less robust seasonal freight market transpired. Market factors that included higher driver wages, lower gain on sale of revenue equipment, and fewer non-contract opportunities negatively affected our margins in our Trucking and Logistics segments.\nTo reduce our risk to fuel price fluctuations in our Trucking segment, we have a fuel surcharge program under which we obtain from our customers additional fuel surcharges that generally recover a majority, but not all, of the increased fuel costs; however, we cannot ensure whether current recovery levels will continue in the future. In discussing our overall and segment-based results of operations, because changes in fuel costs typically cause fuel surcharge revenue to fluctuate, we identify Trucking fuel surcharge revenue separately and omit fuel surcharge revenue from our statistical calculations. We believe that omitting this potentially volatile source of revenue provides a more meaningful comparison of our operating results from period to period.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts, and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nOperating taxes and licenses expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 1.6% for 2015 and 2014. This expense line item is impacted by changes in various fuel tax rates and registration fees associated with our tractor fleet and regional operating facilities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nFuel expense decreased, as a percentage of total revenue, to 12.9% in 2015, from 18.5% in 2014, as the U.S. National Average Diesel Fuel price decreased by 29.2% in 2015. Fuel expense, net of Trucking fuel surcharge, expressed as a percentage of Trucking revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, remained flat year-over-year. Our fuel efficiency initiatives, such as trailer blades, idle-control, more fuel-efficient engines, and driver training programs, continued to be contributing factors in controlling our fuel expense on a cost per company tractor operated mile basis. However, as a percentage of revenue, net fuel expense was consistent, as lower diesel fuel prices and improved fuel efficiency were offset by a greater percentage of miles operated by company-owned tractors (for which we pay the fuel cost) instead of independent contractors (who bear their own fuel cost) in 2015 compared to 2014, as well as an increase in non-paid empty miles percentage (for which we do not receive fuel surcharges). As discussed above, due to the time lag inherent in the fuel surcharge program, our fuel expense, net of fuel surcharge, negatively affects our operating income during periods of sharply rising fuel costs and positively affects our operating income during periods of falling fuel costs. Fuel prices began falling toward the end of 2014 and continued to fall each quarter in 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014.\nThe tables below compare our GAAP operating ratio to our non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Ratio (dollars in thousands).\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, in accordance with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations and because any deferred assets can be fully offset by deferred liabilities. Accordingly, if the facts or financial results were to change in such a way as to affect the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets, judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in the appropriate period.\nMiscellaneous operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 1.9% in 2015, from 0.7% for 2014. The increase is primarily due to the infrequent expense recorded in the second quarter of 2015 for $7.2 million pretax ($4.4 million after tax) relating to expected settlement costs of two class action lawsuits involving employment-related claims in California and Oregon, and also due in part to the decrease in Trucking fuel surcharge component of total revenue, and less gain on sale of equipment to offset these costs. Excluding this infrequent expense, and excluding the effect of the decrease in the fuel surcharge component of consolidated revenue, and lower gain on sale of equipment, miscellaneous operating expenses increased due to increased legal expense associated with the infrequent claim expense, an increase in costs associated with technology and our management information systems, and revenue equipment operating lease expense. Gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses and decreased to $15.3 million in 2015, from $16.8 million in 2014.\nTotal revenue decreased 5.5% for 2016 to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion for 2015 generally due to a more challenging freight environment when compared to 2015. Both our Trucking and Logistics segments experienced a moderate freight market where excess capacity reduced contract pricing and non-contract opportunities were limited, when compared to the prior year, which combined with fewer trucks, lower fuel surcharge revenue, and less non-Trucking services revenue, led to the decline in total revenue.\nOperations and maintenance expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 6.8% in 2016 and 2015. Operations and maintenance expense consists of direct operating expense, equipment maintenance, and tire expense. Operations and maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, decreased to 7.4% in 2016 from 7.6% in 2015, due to improved cost control measures. Direct operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, in 2016 due to lower operating supply costs and drayage related operating costs. We continue to experience tight driver market conditions, and we expect the driver market to remain competitive in 2017, which could negatively affect our recruiting costs.\nWe primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers in our Trucking segment or arranging for the transportation of customer freight by third-party capacity providers in our Logistics segment. Our total revenue is reported under \"Results of Operations\" under Item 7 to Part II of this Annual Report and categorized as (i) Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge, (ii) Trucking fuel surcharge revenue, and (iii) Logistics revenue. Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge, and Trucking fuel surcharge revenue are largely generated by the Trucking services provided by our three Trucking operating units (Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage), whereas Logistics revenue is mostly generated by the logistics services provided by our two Logistics operating units (Brokerage and Intermodal). We also provide logistics, freight management, sourcing, and other non-Trucking services, such as used equipment sales and leasing to independent contractors and third-parties through our Logistics business.\nOperations and maintenance expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 6.8% in 2015 from 6.5% in 2014. Operations and maintenance expense consists of direct operating expense, equipment maintenance, and tire expense. Operations and maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, decreased slightly to 7.6% in 2015 from 7.7% in 2014, as a result of the increased revenue generated in 2015 compared to 2014.\n (1) Purchase obligations primarily consist of obligations to purchase revenue equipment from contracted vendors, and a carry forward of approximately $3.5 million from 2016 contracts. (2) Long-term debt of $18.0 million is borrowings under our line of credit, which has a maturity date of August 2019. We expect to pay-off the debt balance prior to the final maturity date. (3) Investment commitments primarily consist of contractual obligations to investments in various Transportation Resource Partnerships, which are subject to capital calls. The expected timing of the capital calls is presented above. \nWe provide for income taxes at the statutory federal and state rates, adjusted for permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting. Our effective tax rate was 38.0% for 2016 and 36.8% for 2015. The unusually low rate in 2015 was attributable to favorable tax positions taken on amended federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and other miscellaneous non-recurring decreases, which positively impacted our net income by approximately $5.4 million.\nOur capital expenditures can also affect depreciation expense. Trucking depreciation relates primarily to our owned tractors, trailers, ELDs and other communication units, and other similar assets. Changes to this fixed cost are generally attributed to increases or decreases to company-owned equipment and fluctuations in new equipment purchase prices, which have historically been precipitated in part by new or proposed federal and state regulations (such as the EPA engine emissions requirements relating to post-2014 model tractors and the California trailer efficiency requirements). Depreciation can also be affected by the cost of used equipment that we sell or trade and the replacement of older used equipment. Our management periodically reviews the condition, average age, and reasonableness of estimated useful lives and salvage values of our equipment and considers such factors in light of our experience with similar assets, used equipment market conditions, and prevailing industry practice. Total Trucking segment depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $111.7 million in 2016.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\n\nThe following table sets forth revenue and operating income between the Trucking and Logistics segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands).\nAs a result of the above factors, our GAAP operating ratio (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue) was 86.7% for 2016, compared to 85.0% for 2015. Our Adjusted Operating Ratio (total operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge, as a percentage of total revenue, before fuel surcharge), was 85.6% in 2016, compared to 83.2% in 2015. Please see the reconciliation table above for a reconciliation of GAAP operating ratio to Adjusted Operating Ratio.\n\nNet interest and other income, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 0.4% in 2016 from 0.8% in 2015. Other income includes realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities and unrealized gains from our investments in TRP investments that use the equity method of accounting. Our realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities were lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to fewer securities sold during 2016. We repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock in 2016 for $39.9 million, and interest expense decreased in 2016 because of the decreased average borrowing during the year. Our debt balance decreased to $18.0 million at December 31, 2016 from $112.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $243.4 million, $205.8 million, and $177.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase for 2016 is primarily due to lower income tax payments made in 2016, as we depleted the large income tax receivable balance on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015.\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of income in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue and the percentage increase or decrease in the dollar amounts of those items compared to the prior year (dollars in thousands).\nLogistics Strategy and Segment Information\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nOperating Revenue\n\n (1) Purchased transportation expense is comprised of (a) payments to independent contractors, which are primarily attributed to our Trucking segment; (b) payments to third-party capacity providers, which are primarily attributed to our Logistics segment; and (c) payments relating to our logistics, freight management and non-Trucking services. Purchased transportation expense is further discussed in the year-to-year comparison of operating results below. \nThe primary measures we use to evaluate the profitability of our Trucking segment are operating ratio, measured on a GAAP basis (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of revenue), and Adjusted Operating Ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure (operating expenses, net of Trucking fuel surcharge revenue, expressed as a percentage of Trucking revenue, excluding Trucking fuel surcharge revenue). We believe the use of Adjusted Operating Ratio allows us to more effectively compare periods, while excluding the potentially volatile effect of changes in fuel prices. The Board and management focus on our Adjusted Operating Ratio as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of Adjusted Operating Ratio is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance.\nTrucking Strategy and Segment Information\n (1) These items represent non-GAAP financial measures and are not substitutes for, and should be considered in addition to, the GAAP financial measures presented in the previous table. \nNet cash from financing activities typically varies with borrowing activity on our line of credit. In 2016 and 2015, we had net payments to our line of credit of $94.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively, while in 2014, we had net proceeds from borrowing on our line of credit of $96.4 million to fund the purchase of Barr-Nunn. Exercises of stock options and repurchases of our common stock also contributed to the changes in cash used or provided by financing activities during the three years ended December 31, 2016. We repurchased $39.9 million of our common stock on the open market in 2016, and $45.3 million in 2015, while we did not repurchase any of our common stock in 2014. Proceeds from exercises of stock options were $13.2 million, $9.9 million, and $24.4 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We returned $19.6 million, $19.9 million, and $19.6 million to our shareholders by way of dividends in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nOur liquidity is not materially affected by off-balance sheet transactions. See the discussion under \"Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\" under Item 7 to Part II of this Annual Report for a description of our off-balance sheet transactions.\nThe factors below should be considered when comparing our results of operations in 2016 to our results of operations in 2015. Our 2016 results included:\nOur Trucking operating strategy is to achieve a high level of asset utilization within a highly disciplined operating system, while maintaining strict controls over our cost structure. To achieve these goals, we operate primarily in high-density, predictable freight lanes in select geographic regions and attempt to develop and expand our customer base around each of our service centers by providing multiple truckload services for each customer. This operating strategy allows us to take advantage of the large amount of freight transported in regional markets. Our service centers enable us to better serve our customers and work more closely with our driving associates. We operate a premium modern fleet to appeal to drivers and customers, reduce maintenance expenses and driver and equipment downtime, and enhance our fuel and other operating efficiencies. We employ technology in a cost-effective manner to assist us in controlling operating costs and enhancing revenue.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies:\nRecent Consolidated Results of Operations and Year-End Financial Condition\nThe following table sets forth the Trucking segment Adjusted Operating Ratio as if fuel surcharges are excluded from total revenue and instead reported as a reduction of operation expenses, excluding intersegment transactions (dollars in thousands).\nWe currently maintain a line of credit that permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit up to an aggregate of $300.0 million and matures on August 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount outstanding under our line of credit was $18.0 million, which is classified as a long-term liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We also utilized a portion of our line of credit for letters of credit, which are issued to various regulatory authorities and insurance carriers in connection with our self-insurance programs. The issued but unused letters of credit totaled $31.3 million as of December 31, 2016 and $27.4 million as of December 31, 2015. Combining the amounts borrowed and letters of credit issued, we had $250.7 million available for future borrowing under our existing line of credit as of December 31, 2016, compared to $160.6 million as of December 31, 2015. Under our current line of credit agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain financial and other covenants and were in compliance with those covenants as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nAdjusted Operating Ratio is not a substitute for operating ratio measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Although we believe that Adjusted Operating Ratio improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define Adjusted Operating Ratio differently. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Operating Ratio should not be considered a measure of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nIn addition to estimates within our self-insured retention, we also must make judgments concerning our coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. Currently, we are not aware of any such claims. If one or more claims were to exceed our effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a result of the above factors, our GAAP operating ratio (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue) was 85.0% for 2015, compared to 85.2% for 2014. Our Adjusted Operating Ratio (total operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge, as a percentage of revenue, before fuel surcharge), was 83.2% in 2015, compared to 82.4% in 2014. Please see the reconciliation table above for a reconciliation of GAAP operating ratio to Adjusted Operating Ratio.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nLogistics revenue is primarily generated by the Brokerage and Intermodal operating units. Logistics revenue was $217.8 million in 2016 compared to $231.0 million in 2015. Logistics revenue decreased primarily due to declining revenue from our non-Trucking services as we exited our agricultural sourcing business in the first quarter of 2016, as well as due to lower revenue per load because of lower fuel surcharge. Revenue in our Brokerage business, which is the largest component of our Logistics segment, decreased in 2016 compared to 2015; however, we continued to see load volume growth. A shorter length of haul and lower non-contract pricing offset this load volume growth. We achieved this growth by providing more capacity to our customers through our third-party carriers and rail providers.\nWe have created a service network with financial accountability, a modern tractor fleet, access to thousands of third-party capacity transportation providers, and the capability of providing multiple transportation service offerings and modes to customers in North America. We believe our operating strategies are contributing factors to our revenue and earnings growth over time.\n\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 28.2% in 2015 from 24.7% in 2014. Costs associated with healthcare benefits provided to our employees and accruals for workers' compensation benefits are components of our salaries, wages and benefits expense in our consolidated statements of income. Factors contributing to the increase include increases in driver base pay, and a shift from purchased transportation expense to driver salaries and wages expense, as a greater percentage of our tractor fleet was comprised of company tractors rather than independent contractors. Our non-driver personnel salaries and wages increased, as did our payroll taxes and costs associated with benefits provided, as we increased our number of employees, particularly in our Logistics segment. We improved our pay and performance bonus for our driving associates in 2015 in response to an increasingly challenging driver market.\nA tax benefit or liability from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.\nOur Logistics segment is less asset-intensive and is instead dependent upon capable non-driver personnel, modern and effective information technology, and qualified third-party capacity providers. The most significant expense of our Logistics segment, which is primarily variable, is the cost of purchased transportation that we pay to third-party capacity providers (including rail providers), which is included in the \"Purchased transportation\" line of our consolidated statements of income. This expense generally varies depending upon truckload and rail capacity, availability of third-party capacity providers, rates charged to customers, and current freight demand and customer shipping needs. Other Logistics operating expenses are generally fixed and primarily include the compensation and benefits of non-driver personnel (included in the \"Salaries, wages and benefits\" line of our consolidated statements of income) and depreciation and amortization expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 9.4% for 2015 from 8.4% in 2014, primarily because of the decrease in fuel surcharge revenue. As a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, depreciation and amortization increased to 10.5% in 2015 from 10.0% in 2014, as our Trucking revenue growth outpaced revenue growth in our Logistics segment, which is less capital intensive. A greater percentage of our tractor fleet was comprised of company-owned tractors rather than tractors provided by independent contractors, and we experienced higher equipment prices. Depreciation and amortization expense for our Trucking segment, as a percentage of Trucking revenue, was 12.9% in 2015 and 12.3% in 2014. The increased expense is primarily related to the increased number of tractors and trailers owned during 2015. The increased expense was partially offset by higher average revenue per tractor. The majority of our company-owned tractor fleet is comprised of tractors with 2014 compliant engines, which are more expensive than previous tractors due to compliance with NHTSA and EPA emissions standards.\nInsurance and claims expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased slightly to 2.9% in 2015, from 2.8% in 2014. Insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenue, before fuel surcharge, decreased to 3.2% in 2015 from 3.4% in 2014, and decreased slightly on a per mile basis, year-over-year. Insurance and claims expense consists of premiums for liability, physical damage, and cargo, and will vary based upon the frequency and severity of claims, as well as our level of self-insurance, and premium expense.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $8.0 million, compared to $8.7 million as of December 31, 2015. During the next twelve months and beyond, we believe that we will be able to finance our short-term needs for working capital and acquisitions of revenue equipment with cash, cash flows from operations, and financing available under our existing line of credit. We expect to have significant capital requirements over the long-term, which may require us to incur additional debt or seek additional equity capital. The availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions, the market price of our common stock, our financial condition and results of operations, and several other factors over which we have limited control. Nevertheless, based on our recent operating results, current cash position, anticipated future cash flows, and sources of available financing, we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nCommunications expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 0.4% for 2016 and 2015. Communications expense is comprised of costs associated with our tractor and trailer tracking systems, information technology systems, and phone systems.\n (1) Gross margin percentage is based on Logistics revenue and purchased transportation net of intersegment transactions. \n\nSince our Logistics segment depends on effective usage of information systems and technology that enable us to efficiently arrange for the transportation of our customers' freight and remain resourceful and responsive in meeting customer shipping needs. As our Logistics services evolve, we may incur costs to upgrade, integrate, or expand our information systems and technology, but we do not expect that costs for such improvements will require significant capital expenditures in the future. Total Logistics segment depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $4.4 million in 2016, which is primarily attributed to equipment leased to third parties.\nTotal revenue increased 7.3% for 2015 to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion for 2014, generally because of increased tractor productivity and average revenue per loaded mile in our Trucking segment and shipment volume growth in our Logistics segment.\nThe following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016, our contractual obligations and payments due by corresponding period for our short- and long-term operating expenses and other commitments (amounts in thousands).\n\nBeginning in 2014, we issued performance restricted stock units ( PRSUs\u201d), to selected key employees, that may be earned based on achieving performance targets approved by our compensation committee annually. The initial award is subject to an adjustment determined by our performance achieved over a three-year performance period when compared to the objective performance standards adopted by the Compensation Committee; this adjustment ranges from 0 percent to 150 percent of the initial amount of the grant. A further adjustment is made based on our total shareholder return compared to a peer group approved by our Compensation Committee. This adjustment ranges from 75 percent to 125 percent of the award after adjustment for our performance. Furthermore, the PRSUs have additional service requirements subsequent to the achievement of the performance targets. PRSUs do not earn dividend equivalents. The fair value of each PRSU grant is estimated on the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model. Compensation expense is recognized straight-line over the requisite service period based on management's estimated probability of the performance targets being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date.\nOperating Expenses\nThe growth of our business has required, and will continue to require, significant investments. In our Trucking business, where investments are substantial, the primary investments are in new tractors and trailers and, to a lesser extent, in technology, service centers, and working capital. In our Logistics business, where investments are modest, the primary investments are in technology and working capital. Our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and borrowings under our line of credit.\nEffectively controlling our expenses is an important element of maximizing our profitability. The most significant expenses of our Trucking segment are primarily variable and include fuel and fuel taxes, driver-related expenses (such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment) and costs associated with independent contractors (which are primarily included in purchased transportation expense recorded on the \"Purchased transportation\" line of our consolidated statements of income). Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance expense (which includes costs for replacement tires for our revenue equipment) and our total cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency, and other factors. The main fixed costs for our Trucking segment are the acquisition and depreciation of long-term assets (such as revenue equipment and service centers) and the compensation of non-driver personnel.\nIntroduction\nOperating Expenses\nWe primarily measure the Logistics segment's profitability by reviewing the gross margin percentage (revenue net of intersegment transactions, less purchased transportation expense, net of intersegment transactions, expressed as a percentage of revenue net of intersegment transactions) and the operating ratio. The gross margin percentage can be affected by customer rates and the costs of securing third-party capacity providers. Our third-party capacity providers are generally not subject to long-term or predetermined contracted rates, and our operating results could be affected if the availability of third-party capacity providers or the rates for such providers change in the future. The following table lists the gross margin percentage for our Brokerage and Intermodal businesses combined.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n (1) Average revenue per tractor is based on Trucking revenue, net of intersegment transactions, and does not include fuel surcharge revenue. \nWe offer a broad range of full truckload transportation and logistics services with one of North America's largest tractor fleets, operated through a nationwide network of service centers, and contractual access to thousands of third-party capacity providers. We have grown substantially by increasing the geographic reach of our service center network and by expanding the breadth of our services for customers. Our Trucking segment provides truckload transportation, including dedicated services, of various products, goods, and materials for our diverse customer base through our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operating units. The Brokerage and Intermodal operating units of our Logistics segment provide a multitude of shipment solutions, including additional sources of truckload capacity and alternative transportation modes, by utilizing our vast network of third-party capacity providers and rail providers, as well as certain logistics, freight management, and other non-Trucking services. Our objective is to operate our Trucking and Logistics businesses with industry-leading margins and growth, while providing safe, high-quality, cost-effective solutions for our customers.\nLogistics revenue is primarily generated by the Brokerage and Intermodal operating units. Logistics revenue was $231.0 million in 2015 and $210.3 million in 2014. We achieved the increase in revenue by providing more capacity to our customers through our third-party carriers and rail providers. Shipment volume growth in our Brokerage business, which is the largest component of our Logistics segment, increased 47.9% in 2015 compared to 2014, as we continued to increase our buyer pool, which lead to increased access to third-party capacity. Although our revenue per load was negatively affected in 2015 as a result of lower fuel surcharge, a shorter length of haul, and fewer non-contract opportunities, we continued to expand gross margins.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nWhen evaluating Trucking revenue, we consider the following key operating statistics for each period: (i) average revenue per tractor; (ii) average length of haul (miles with loaded trailer cargo); (iii) average percentage of non-paid empty miles (miles without trailer cargo); and (iv) average number of tractors and trailers in operation. The following table sets forth certain key operating statistics and certain other statistical data of the Trucking segment for the indicated periods (dollars in thousands).\nAs a result of the preceding factors, our net income attributable to Knight Transportation increased to 9.9%, compared to 9.3% in 2014.\nProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment is depreciated to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life, which ranges from one to thirty years. Salvage values range from zero to 25% of the capitalized cost. We periodically review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets based upon, among other things, our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and prevailing industry practice. We both routinely and periodically review and make a determination whether the salvage value of our tractors and trailers is higher or lower than originally expected. This determination is based upon (i) market conditions in equipment sales, (ii) the guaranteed repurchase price with contracted dealerships, and (iii) the average miles driven on the equipment being sold. Future changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates, or fluctuation in market value not reflected in our estimates, could have a material effect on our results of operations. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances for indications that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, we compare the carrying value of our assets to the fair value to determine if any impairment exists. In the event that the carrying value exceeds the fair market value, we will adjust the property and equipment to the fair value and recognize any impairment loss. Our assets classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or net selling value.\nWe expect to continue to utilize the flexibility of our model to react and adapt to market conditions. We believe we can optimize our model and refine our execution in reaction to, or in anticipation of, transportation market dynamics, particularly the markets for truckload and logistics services that we offer. We plan to continue to evaluate additional strategic acquisitions to supplement our growth.\nItem 7, as well as other items of this Annual Report, contains certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and such statements are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical or current fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including without limitation: any projections of earnings, revenues, cash flows, dividends, capital expenditures, or other financial items; any statement of plans, strategies, and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed acquisition plans, new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; and any statements of belief and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. In this Item 7, statements relating to the ability of our infrastructure to support future growth, the flexibility of our model to adapt to market conditions, our ability to recruit and retain qualified drivers, our ability to react to market conditions, our ability to gain market share, future tractor prices, potential acquisitions, our equipment purchasing plans and equipment turnover, the expected freight environment and economic trends, whether we grow organically, our ability to obtain favorable pricing terms from vendors and suppliers, expected liquidity and methods for achieving sufficient liquidity, future fuel prices, future third-party service provider relationships and availability, future compensation arrangements with independent contractors and drivers, our expected need or desire to incur indebtedness, expected sources of liquidity for capital expenditures and allocation of capital, expected tractor trade-ins, expected sources of working capital and funds for acquiring revenue equipment, expected capital expenditures, future asset utilization, future capital requirements, future trucking capacity, future consumer spending, expected freight demand and volumes, future rates, future depreciation and amortization, expected tractor and trailer fleet age, regulatory changes and the impact thereof, and future purchased transportation expense, among others, are forward-looking statements. Such statements may be identified by their use of terms or phrases such as \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"projects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" \"hopes,\" and similar terms and phrases. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available operating, financial, and competitive information. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, which could cause future events and actual results to differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by, or underlying the forward-looking statements.

Readers should review and consider the factors discussed in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" along with various disclosures in our press releases, shareholder reports, and other filings with the SEC.\nPurchased transportation expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 20.9% for 2016 and 2015. Purchased transportation expense is comprised of (i) payments to independent contractors for our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operations in our Trucking segment; (ii) payments to third-party capacity providers for our Brokerage operations and to railroads for our Intermodal operations; and (iii) payments relating to logistics freight management, and non-Trucking services in our Logistics segment. The overall decrease in this category is primarily due to lower fuel surcharge equivalent payments to independent contractors and third-party capacity providers. Purchased transportation costs generally take into account changes in diesel fuel prices, resulting in lower payments during periods of declining fuel prices. Purchased transportation expense within our Logistics segment decreased as expected with the decrease in Logistics revenue, but this decrease was hindered by increased costs associated with exiting our agriculture sourcing business in the first quarter of 2016. We expect purchased transportation will increase as a percentage of total revenue, if we are successful in continuing to grow our Logistics segment.\nAll such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in the events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nAs a result of the preceding factors, our net income attributable to Knight Transportation decreased to 8.4%, compared to 9.9% in 2015.\nWe provide for income taxes at the statutory federal and state rates, adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting. Our effective tax rate was 36.8% for 2015 and 39.7% for 2014. The unusually low rate in 2015 was attributable to favorable tax positions taken on amended federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and other miscellaneous non-recurring decreases, that positively affected our net income by approximately $5.4 million.\nLogistics revenue is generated primarily by our Brokerage and Intermodal operating units. We also provide logistics, freight management and other non-Trucking services to our customers through our Logistics business. We are generally paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for arranging freight transportation for our customers and providing other Logistics services. Additional revenue is generated by offering specialized logistics solutions (including, but not limited to, origin management, surge volumes, disaster relief, special projects, and other logistics needs). Our Logistics revenue is mainly affected by the rates we obtain from customers, the freight volumes we ship through our third-party capacity providers, and our ability to secure qualified third-party capacity providers to transport customer freight. Increases in shipments serviced by our Brokerage and Intermodal operating units and continued increases in the number of customers utilizing our Logistics services contributed to the improved productivity realized in 2016. We were able to provide Logistics services to our existing customers as well as effectively expand to new customers in 2016.\nManagement judgment is also required regarding a variety of other factors including the appropriateness of tax strategies, expected future tax consequences based on our future performance, and our likelihood of success in the event that tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities. We utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall income taxes. It is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed, resulting in an increased liability for income taxes. Significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs. An ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCommunications expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 0.4% for 2015 and 2014. Communications expense is comprised of our tractor and trailer tracking systems, information technology systems, and phone systems.\nInsurance and claims expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 3.1% in 2016, from 2.9% in 2015. Insurance and claims expense as a percentage of total revenue, excluding fuel surcharge, increased slightly to 3.3% in 2016 from 3.2% in 2015, and increased slightly on a per mile basis, year-over-year. The increase was partly due to the decrease in total revenue in 2016 from 2015, combined with slightly higher premium costs and changes in the severity of claims. Insurance and claims expense consists of premiums for liability, physical damage, and cargo, and will vary based upon the frequency and severity of claims, as well as our level of self-insurance, and premium expense.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur 2015 results included:\nTrucking revenue is generated by our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operating units. Generally, we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our Trucking services. Additional revenues are generated by charging for tractor and trailer detention, loading and unloading activities, dedicated services, and other specialized services, as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel. The main factors that affect our Trucking revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, and the number of loaded miles we generate with our equipment.\nThe following table sets forth the Logistics segment revenue, operating expenses, and operating income (dollars in thousands).\nTrends and Outlook\nIn 2016, we generated $243.4 million in cash flow from operations and used $89.0 million for capital expenditures, net of equipment sales. During 2016, we returned $59.5 million to our shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and stock repurchases. We ended the year with $8.0 million of cash, $18.0 million of long-term debt, and $786.5 million of shareholders' equity.\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $101.0 million, $138.3 million, and $266.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The higher investment total in 2014 is due to the acquisition of Barr-Nunn in the fourth quarter of 2014 for approximately $110.5 million total consideration. Excluding the Barr-Nunn acquisition, capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment (net of equipment sales and trade-ins), office equipment, and land and leasehold improvements totaled $89.0 million, $149.4 million, and $178.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease in 2016 is due to our decision to limit organic fleet expansion and extend the expected trade cycle of our tractors in response to a challenging freight market and soft used equipment market. Excluding any acquisitions, we currently anticipate capital expenditures, net of trade-ins, of approximately $95.0 million to $110.0 million for 2017. We expect to use our capital expenditure estimate primarily to acquire new revenue equipment for replacement and not fleet growth.\nOur liquidity is not materially affected by off-balance sheet transactions. Like many other transportation companies, we have periodically utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment requirements and terminal facilities requirements. We lease revenue equipment under non-cancellable operating leases, and we lease some of our service centers and temporary trailer storage under non-cancellable operating leases. Operating lease expense for such equipment, facilities and trailer storage is reflected in the \"Miscellaneous operating expenses\" line in our consolidated statements of income, and totaled $5.0 million, $4.7 million, and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nResults of Operations\n \u25cf Total revenue decreased 5.5%, to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion; \u25cf Net income attributable to Knight Transportation decreased 19.6%, to $93.9 million from $116.7 million; and \u25cf Net earnings attributable to Knight Transportation per diluted share decreased 18.4%, to $1.16 from $1.42. \nDepreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 10.4% for 2016 from 9.4% in 2015, in part due to the decrease in fuel surcharge revenue. As a percentage of revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, depreciation and amortization increased to 11.3% in 2016 from 10.5% in 2015. This increase was due to a combination of the decrease in revenue, before fuel surcharge, driven by the decrease in average revenue per tractor in our Trucking segment, and the decrease in revenue from our less asset-intensive Logistics segment, driven by the decrease in revenue per load and reduced non-Trucking service revenue. Depreciation and amortization expense for our Trucking segment, as a percentage of Trucking revenue, was 13.8% in 2016, compared to 12.9% in 2015. Factors contributing to the increase were the decrease in average revenue per tractor, rising new equipment prices, and an increase in our tractor to trailer ratio. Absent offsetting improvements in average revenue per tractor or growth in our Logistics operations, our expense as a percentage of revenue in this category could increase in the future. With rising equipment prices, and a continuing soft used equipment market, we have extended the expected trade cycle for our tractors, which is expected to reduce capital expenditures and restrict higher depreciation and amortization costs in the future. In implementing the extended trade cycle, we have been proactive in managing our preventative maintenance program with a goal of mitigating the additional maintenance cost commonly associated with a slightly older fleet.\nShare-Based Payments. We have stock options outstanding under our stock compensation plan. Exercises are permitted in pre-determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant. Each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant; expiration will not exceed ten years from the date of the grant. The calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments. These estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of our stock options is expensed on a straight-line basis, which generally ranges between five to seven years. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero-coupon Treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option. Management judgment is required to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model; management bases those decisions on historical data. The expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share-based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding.\nConsolidated Revenue and Expenses\nIn 2017, we expect the freight environment to continue to be challenging until capacity begins to tighten as a result of low new tractor orders, a weak demand for used equipment, and additional regulatory burdens expected to phase in over the coming quarters. We expect the environment to become more favorable in the second half of the year, as we believe capacity will continue to exit the market and pricing will respond positively. Market factors that include higher driver wages, lower gain on sale of revenue equipment, and fewer non-contract opportunities may negatively affect our margins in our Trucking and Logistics segments. In this environment, we plan to limit organic fleet expansion, focus on cost control, grow revenues in our Logistics segment, and continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities.\nTrucking revenue, net of fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, was $810.4 million in 2016 compared to $830.7 million in 2015. Trucking fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $89.9 million in 2016 from $121.2 million in 2015, as fuel prices were consistently lower during 2016 compared to 2015. We increased average miles per tractor 1.4% in 2016, compared to 2015. However, this improvement was offset by a decrease in average revenue per loaded mile by 1.5%, and an increase in non-paid empty mile percentage rate to 12.5% from 12.0%. This negatively affected our tractor productivity, as measured by average annual Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge, per tractor, which decreased by 0.7% in 2016, compared to 2015. If economic conditions improve and capacity tightens, we anticipate that we will be able to obtain rate increases in 2017 and beyond; however, adverse changes in these factors could either prevent rate increases or negatively affect existing rates.\nNet interest and other income, as a percentage of revenue, remained constant at 0.8% in 2015, and 2014. Other income included realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities and unrealized gains from our investments in TRP III using the equity method of accounting. Our realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities were higher in 2015, compared to 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we funded the acquisition of Barr-Nunn for approximately $112.4 million with borrowings from our existing line of credit. We repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock in 2015 for $45.3 million, and interest expense increased in 2015 because of the increased average borrowing during the year. Our debt balance decreased to $112.0 million at December 31, 2015, from $134.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nOperating taxes and licenses expense, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 1.6% in 2016 and 2015. This expense line item is impacted by changes in various fuel tax rates and registration fees associated with our tractor fleet and regional operating facilities.\nFactors that affect our results of operations are industry-wide economic factors, such as freight demand, truckload and rail intermodal capacity, fuel prices, inventory levels, industrial production, government regulation, and unemployment rates, as well as our capital allocation, sales and marketing, operating, and spending decisions. We measure our results through key metrics, such as the number of tractors we operate, our revenue per tractor (which includes primarily our revenue per total mile and our number of miles per tractor), freight volumes brokered to third-party capacity providers (including our rail partners), driver and independent contractor recruitment and retention, and our ability to control costs on a company-wide basis, as measured by cost per mile in our Trucking segment and non-GAAP operating ratio ( Adjusted Operating Ratio\u201d) in both segments. Please see the reconciliation table below for a reconciliation of GAAP operating ratio to Adjusted Operating Ratio. Our success depends on our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our resources in providing transportation and logistics solutions to our customers in light of such factors. We evaluate the growth opportunities for each of our Trucking and Logistics businesses based on customer demand and supply chain trends, availability of drivers and third-party capacity providers, expected returns on invested capital, expected net cash flows, and our company-specific capabilities.\nIn 2016, our Trucking segment operated an average of 4,706 tractors, a decrease of 87 tractors from a year ago. Asset utilization, as measured by average miles per tractor, improved 1.4% in 2016 compared to 2015, while productivity, as measured by average annual revenue per tractor, before fuel surcharge, decreased 0.7% in 2016. Our Trucking segment achieved an operating ratio of 84.9% and an Adjusted Operating Ratio of 83.2% in 2016, compared to an Adjusted Operating Ratio of 80.5% in 2015. Higher net fuel expense, less gain on sale of revenue equipment, and higher driver-related expenses were the main factors negatively affecting our 2016 operating results when compared to the prior year. Shipments serviced by our Logistics segment increased as we continued to increase our Logistics services customers, and to expand our third-party carrier network. However, revenues in our Logistics segment decreased 5.7% in 2016, compared to 2015, due to a decrease in revenue per load.\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements set forth beginning at page of this report for discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nTrucking revenue increased to $830.7 million in 2015 from $715.7 million in 2014. Trucking fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $121.2 million in 2015 from $176.3 million in 2014, as fuel prices declined in each quarter of 2015. Tractor productivity, as measured by average annual Trucking revenue, before fuel surcharge per tractor, increased in 2015, compared to 2014. This was attributable to improved contract pricing. Average revenue per loaded mile increased 4.2%, as we improved pricing, but was partially offset by an increase in non-paid empty mile percentage rate to 12.0% from 10.1%.\nThe following table sets forth the Logistics revenue, operating expenses, and operating income, excluding intersegment transactions (dollars in thousands).\nSeveral issues affecting the trucking industry could also cause our costs to increase in future periods. These issues include driver and independent contractor availability, fuel price fluctuations, increases to new tractor and trailer purchase prices, and changes in federal and state regulations. From a cost perspective, recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers, independent contractors, and third-party capacity providers may become increasingly costly; equipment prices may continue to rise, medical, workers' compensation, and litigation expenses are increasing more rapidly than general inflation, and potentially higher fuel prices may not be fully offset by fuel surcharges. In the current economic and regulatory environments, it will be important to allocate equipment to more profitable shipments, use technology to generate efficiencies, continue to grow our Logistics segment, and effectively manage costs. We believe we have the service center network, modern tractor fleet, comprehensive truckload and logistics services, management team and qualified personnel, technology, intense focus on cost control, and capital resources necessary to successfully overcome these challenges and capitalize on future opportunities.\nOperating Revenue\nBusiness Overview\nFuel expense decreased, as a percentage of total revenue, to 11.6% in 2016, from 12.9% in 2015, as the U.S. National Average Diesel Fuel price decreased by 14.9% in 2016. Fuel expense, net of Trucking fuel surcharge, expressed as a percentage of Trucking revenue, before Trucking fuel surcharge, increased to 4.9% in 2016, from 3.8% in 2015. Our fuel surcharge program helps to offset increases in fuel prices, but applies only to loaded miles and typically does not offset non-paid empty miles, idle time, and out of route miles driven. Typical fuel surcharge programs involve a computation based on the change in national or regional fuel prices. These programs may update as often as weekly, but typically require a specified minimum change in fuel cost to prompt a change in Trucking fuel surcharge revenue. Therefore, many of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when the change is reflected in Trucking fuel surcharge revenue. Due to this time lag, our fuel expense, net of fuel surcharge, negatively affects our operating income during periods of sharply rising fuel costs and positively affects our operating income during periods of falling fuel costs. Fuel prices were falling throughout 2015 and bottomed out in the first quarter of 2016, before rising in each of the remaining quarters of 2016. We expect fuel expense will continue to increase during the first part of 2017. We continue to utilize fuel efficiency initiatives, such as trailer blades, idle-control, more fuel-efficient engines, and driver training programs that we believe will help to control our fuel expense.\nOur Trucking segment requires substantial capital expenditures for purchases of new revenue equipment. We fund these purchases with cash flows from operations and financing available under our existing line of credit. We operated an average of 4,706 tractors in 2016, of which 4,286 were company-owned tractors. The average age of our company-owned tractor fleet was 1.9 years at December 31, 2016, which we expect to increase slightly in 2017. We also operated an average of 12,288 trailers in 2016, with an average age of 4.4 years as of December 31, 2016. We expect the average age of our trailers to remain relatively constant in 2017. Our net property and equipment at December 31, 2016 was $802.9 million, most of which relates to our Trucking segment.\nSalaries, wages and benefits expense, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 29.9% in 2016 from 28.2% in 2015. Costs associated with healthcare benefits provided to our employees and accruals for workers' compensation benefits are components of our salaries, wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income. The primary reason for the increase is attributable to lower total revenue in 2016 compared to 2015, as the dollar expense remained relatively flat. Additional factors affecting this expense included further increases to driver base pay during 2016, and a shift from driver pay to purchased transportation expense, as more of our fleet was comprised of independent contractors in 2016 compared to 2015. We believe that the driver market remains challenging and that several ongoing market factors, including the CSA implementation of stricter regulations, has further reduced the pool of available drivers. We expect that driver pay will continue to be inflationary on a year-over-year basis. Having a sufficient number of qualified driving associates continues to be a major concern, although we continue to seek ways to attract and retain qualified driving associates, including investing in technology and service centers that improve the experience of drivers.\n\nOur consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, were as follows:\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nClaims Accrual. Reserves are established based on estimated or expected losses for claims. The primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability, personal injury, property damage, collision, comprehensive, workers' compensation, and employee medical expenses. We maintain self-insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self-insured liabilities. We also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self-insurance amounts. The reserves are analyzed quarterly and represent accruals for the estimated self-insured portion of pending claims, including adverse development of known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, the facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. We have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability would be adversely affected.\nPurchased transportation expense, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased to 20.9% for 2015 from 21.6% for 2014. Purchased transportation expense is comprised of (i) payments to independent contractors for our Dry Van, Refrigerated, and Drayage operations in our Trucking segment; and (ii) payments to third-party capacity providers for our Brokerage operations and to railroads for our Intermodal operations; and (iii) payments relating to logistics freight management, and non-Trucking services in our Logistics segment. The overall decrease in this category is primarily due to lower fuel surcharge equivalent payments to independent contractors and third-party capacity providers, a smaller percentage of our miles being operated by independent contractors, and the growth in our larger Trucking segment operations, which grew revenues by 16.1% in 2015. Purchased transportation expense attributed to payments to third-party capacity providers (including railroads and sourcing activities) in our Logistics segment increased 10.4% in 2015, when compared to 2014. Purchased transportation costs generally take into account changes in diesel fuel prices, resulting in lower payments during periods of declining fuel prices.\nWe have service and performance-based restricted stock awards outstanding. Our compensation expense is based on fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 under which we estimate the expense.", "item_7_tables": "Table 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td>
