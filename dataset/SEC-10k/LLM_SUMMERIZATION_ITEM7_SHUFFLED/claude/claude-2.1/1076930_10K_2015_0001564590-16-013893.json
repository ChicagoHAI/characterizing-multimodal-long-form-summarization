The JK Lasers business divestiture does not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment.\n2016 Restructuring\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the Company initiated a program targeting annualized savings of $4.5 million to $5.5 million after the program is fully executed. The 2016 restructuring program includes consolidating our manufacturing operations to optimize our facility footprint and to better utilize resources, and reducing redundant costs due to productivity cost savings and business volume reductions. The Company expects to incur cash charges of $4.5 million to $5.5 million related to this program, which we anticipate completing during the second quarter of 2016. The Company incurred costs related to the 2016 restructuring program amounting to $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 Restructuring\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, the Company implemented a program to eliminate redundant costs, as a result of acquisition and divestiture activities, to better align our operations to our strategic growth plans, to further integrate our business lines, and as a consequence of our productivity initiatives. The Company substantially completed the program in 2015, incurring costs amounting to $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We principally intend to reallocate resources and reinvest savings from the 2015 restructuring into higher growth businesses and lower cost regions.\nOverview of Financial Results\nTotal revenue for 2015 was $373.6 million, an increase of $8.9 million, or 2.4%, versus the prior year primarily as the net result of our acquisitions and divestitures, which increased revenues by $10.0 million, or 2.8%. Foreign exchange rates adversely impacted our revenue by 4.0% during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in foreign exchange rates, total revenue for 2015 increased 3.6% versus the prior year. Our organic revenue growth is summarized as follows:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Change attributable to acquisitions and divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Plus: Change due to foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Organic growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe organic growth in our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to growth in our Laser Products and Precision Motion segments offset by a decline in revenue in our Vision Technologies (formerly known as Medical Technologies) segment. The increase in revenue in our Laser Products segment was attributable to an increase in revenue from our laser beam delivery and CO2 lasers products. The growth in our Precision Motion segment was driven by an increase in revenue of optical encoders products, partially offset by a decline in revenue from our air bearing spindles products. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Vision Technologies segment related to our visualization solutions product line.\nOperating income from continuing operations increased $45.7 million from an operating loss of $16.8 million in 2014 to operating income of $28.9 million in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an impairment charge of $41.4 million related to the NDS business in 2014 and an increase in gross profit in 2015.\nDiluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) from continuing operations increased $1.51 from a loss per share of ($0.49) in 2014 to an earnings per share of $1.02 in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to operating income from continuing operations in 2015 versus operating loss from continuing operations in the prior year and higher other income resulting from the gain recognized from the JK Lasers divestiture.\nThe specific components of our operating results for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are further discussed below.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the years indicated:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

in 2015 decreased by $9.4 million, or 5.3%, versus the prior year, as a result of the JK Lasers divestiture, which reduced segment revenues by $16.7 million, partially offset by an increase in revenue of our laser beam delivery and CO2 laser products due to an increase in demand in the advanced industrial market and certain medical applications and the Lincoln Laser acquisition.\nLaser Products segment revenue in 2014 increased by $11.1 million, or 6.7%, versus the prior year, due to growth across all product lines. The revenue growth was primarily due to an increase in revenue of our CO2 lasers and fiber lasers products, driven by new product launches, new customer wins, and market growth. In addition, revenue of our laser beam delivery products grew due to increased demand in material processing in advanced industrial markets and certain medical applications.\nVision Technologies\nVision Technologies segment revenue in 2015 increased by $2.5 million, or 2.1%, versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to revenue from our optical data collection business being included in reported revenue in the prior year only following the JADAK acquisition in March 2014 and increases in revenue from our thermal printers and light and color measurement products,\npartially offset by a decline in our visualization solutions revenue as a result of our radiology products and customer qualification cycles.\nVision Technologies segment revenue in 2014 increased by $31.9 million, or 35.3%, versus the prior year. A $45.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the JADAK acquisition was partially offset by a decline in revenue in our visualization solutions products as a result of dual sourcing at an OEM customer that began in 2013, softness in medical equipment spending impacting our customer's demand for our products, and delays in new product introductions.\nPrecision Motion\nPrecision Motion segment revenue in 2015 increased by $15.7 million, or 24.3%, versus the prior year. This increase was principally driven by the Applimotion acquisition and increased revenue of our optical encoders products as a result of increased customer volumes in both the medical and advanced industrial markets, partially offset by a decline in revenue of our air bearing spindles products due to lower demand from the printed circuit board industry.\nPrecision Motion segment revenue in 2014 increased by $4.8 million, or 7.9%, versus the prior year. This increase was principally driven by increased revenue of our optical encoders products as a result of a market share gain with a major OEM customer and new customer wins.\nGross Profit\nThe following table sets forth the gross profit and gross profit margin for each of our reportable segments for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laser Products\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vision Technologies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Precision Motion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,387\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,068\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (194\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit margin:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laser Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vision Technologies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Precision Motion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit and gross profit margin can be influenced by a number of factors, including product mix, pricing, volume, manufacturing efficiencies and utilization, costs for raw materials and outsourced manufacturing, headcount, inventory obsolescence and warranty expenses.\nLaser Products\nLaser Products segment gross profit in 2015 decreased $0.6 million, or 0.8%, versus the prior year primarily due to a decline in revenue as a result of the JK Lasers divestiture, which decreased gross profit by $4.9 million, partially offset by revenue growth in our laser beam delivery and CO2 laser products and an increase in gross profit margin. Laser Products segment gross profit margin was 43.7% for 2015, compared with a gross profit margin of 41.8% for the prior year. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the JK Lasers divestiture, which accounted for 1.3 percentage point of the 1.9 percentage point increase. The remaining increase in gross profit margin was driven by increases in volume in our laser beam delivery and CO2 laser products, product mix, and continuous improvement productivity initiatives.\nLaser Products segment gross profit in 2014 increased $5.4 million, or 7.9%, versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue and an increase in gross profit margin. Laser Products segment gross profit margin was 41.8% for 2014, compared with a gross profit margin of 41.3% for the prior year. The 0.5 percentage point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to productivity improvements as a result of our manufacturing process improvement initiatives and margin improvements in our fiber lasers products.\nVision Technologies\nVision Technologies segment gross profit for 2015 increased $0.3 million, or 0.6%, versus the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to a decline in intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset by product mix. Vision Technologies segment gross profit margin was 39.3% for 2015, compared with a gross profit margin of 39.8% for the prior year. The 0.5 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to product mix, offset by lower intangible asset amortization expense. Included in gross profit for 2015 was amortization of developed technologies of $2.2 million. Included in gross profit for 2014 was amortization of developed technologies and amortization of inventory fair value step-ups of $3.7 million.\nVision Technologies segment gross profit for 2014 increased $12.9 million, or 35.9%, versus the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the JADAK acquisition in March 2014, which accounted for an $18.9 million increase in gross profit year over year, partially offset by a decline in gross profit for our visualization solutions products due to lower revenue. Vision Technologies segment gross profit margin remained relatively flat year over year. Included in gross profit was amortization of developed technologies and amortization of inventory fair value step-ups of $3.7 million and $3.1 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPrecision Motion\nPrecision Motion segment gross profit for 2015 increased $8.4 million, or 29.6%, versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue and gross profit margin. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 45.6% for 2015, compared with a gross profit margin of 43.7% for the prior year. The 1.9 percentage point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to an increase in volumes, product mix and continuous improvement productivity initiatives.\nPrecision Motion segment gross profit for 2014 increased $0.6 million, or 2.0%, versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue volume of our optical encoders products. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 43.7% for 2014, compared with a gross profit margin of 46.3% for the prior year. The 2.6 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin was a consequence of manufacturing ramp-up costs.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table sets forth operating expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development and engineering\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of purchased intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 326.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 166,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development and Engineering Expenses\nResearch and development and engineering ( R&D\u201d) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects.\nR&D expenses were $31.0 million, or 8.3% of revenue, in 2015, versus $29.0 million, or 7.9% of revenue, in 2014. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by the JK Lasers divestiture.\nR&D expenses were $29.0 million, or 7.9% of revenue, in 2014, versus $23.8 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in 2013. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to the acquisition of JADAK.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems and executive management.\nSG&A expenses were $82.0 million, or 22.0% of revenue, in 2015, versus $84.4 million, or 23.1% of revenue, in 2014. SG&A expenses decreased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the JK Lasers divestiture and lower compensation expense, partially offset by increases from current year acquisitions and the JADAK acquisition in March 2014.\nSG&A expenses were $84.4 million, or 23.1% of revenue, in 2014, versus $76.3 million, or 24.1% of revenue, in 2013. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to the acquisition of JADAK.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets is charged to our Laser Products, Vision Technologies and Precision Motion segments. Amortization of core technologies is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of customer relationships, trademarks, backlog and other intangibles are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization for developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $7.6 million, or 2.0% of revenue, in 2015, versus $10.3 million, or 2.8% of revenue, in 2014. The decrease, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was related to a decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets from prior year acquisitions.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $10.3 million, or 2.8% of revenue, in 2014, versus $7.3 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2013. The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets from the JADAK acquisition.\nRestructuring, Acquisition and Divestiture Related Costs\nRestructuring, acquisition and divestiture related charges primarily relate to our restructuring programs, acquisition related costs incurred for the acquisition of Skyetek in December 2015, Lincoln Laser in November 2015, Applimotion in February 2015, JADAK in March 2014 and NDS in January 2013. Acquisition related costs also include costs related to future potential acquisitions, failed acquisitions and changes in fair value of contingent considerations. Divestiture costs primarily related to the JK Lasers divestiture in April 2015.\nThe Company recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $8.3 million in 2015, versus $1.9 million in 2014. The Company recognized acquisition related costs of $1.3 million in 2015. Acquisition related costs included expenses of $1.9 million related to acquisitions in 2015, partially offset by a $0.6 million reversal of accruals for earn-out agreements in connection with the 2014 JADAK acquisition. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $5.8 million primarily related to our restructuring programs and $1.1 million in divestiture costs related to the JK Lasers divestiture. The increase in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs is primarily due to the increase in costs related to restructuring programs in 2015. Acquisition related costs were $1.5 million during 2014.\nThe Company recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $1.9 million in 2014, versus $5.4 million in 2013. The Company recognized acquisition related costs of $1.5 million in 2014, which included expenses of $0.6 million recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with the JADAK acquisition. The decrease in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs is primarily due to the decrease in costs related to restructuring programs in 2014 as compared to 2013. Acquisition related costs were $1.6 million during 2013.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $41.4 million in the consolidated financial statements in 2014 as a result of lower expectations for revenue and operating profit from our NDS business.\nOperating Income (Loss) by Segment\nThe following table sets forth operating income by segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laser Products\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vision Technologies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,057\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (43,079\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Precision Motion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,858\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,803\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,325\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,806\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLaser Products\nLaser Products operating income from continuing operations for 2015 increased by $2.9 million, or 8.8%, from 2014 primarily due to the improved profitability of the Laser Products segment after the JK Lasers divestiture, partially offset by an increase in restructuring and divestiture related costs of $1.7 million. Amortization of intangible assets for the Laser Products segment was $4.4 million in 2015 compared to $4.1 million in 2014.\nLaser Products operating income from continuing operations for 2014 increased by $7.9 million, or 31.5%, from 2013 primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $5.4 million and a $2.0 million decrease in restructuring and acquisition related charges compared to 2013. Amortization of intangible assets for the Laser Products segment was $4.1 million in both 2014 and 2013.\nVision Technologies\nVision Technologies operating loss from continuing operations decreased by $41.0 million from an operating loss of $43.1 million in 2014 to an operating loss of $2.1 million in 2015 primarily due to the NDS goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge recorded in 2014 and a decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles of $4.8 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses as a result of the 2014 JADAK acquisition and an increase in restructuring charges related to our 2016 restructuring program.\nVision Technologies operating income from continuing operations decreased by $46.6 million from operating income of $3.6 million in 2013 to an operating loss of $43.1 million in 2014 primarily due to the NDS goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge of $41.4 million, an increase in amortization of intangibles and amortization of our inventory fair value step-ups of $3.7 million and a decline in visualization solutions revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating income from continuing operations as a result of the JADAK acquisition.\nPrecision Motion\nPrecision Motion operating income from continuing operations for 2015 increased by $3.9 million, or 29.6%, from 2014 primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $8.4 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses due to the Applimotion acquisition and an increase in restructuring charges related to our 2016 restructuring program.\nPrecision Motion operating income from continuing operations for 2014 increased by $1.0 million, or 8.0%, from 2013 primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $0.6 million and a $0.4 million decrease in restructuring costs.\nUnallocated Corporate and Shared Services\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared service functions and other public company costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs.\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2015 increased by $2.1 million, or 10.4%, from 2014 primarily due to an increase in professional services costs and an increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $1.1 million. Restructuring and acquisition related costs were $2.6 million in 2015, compared to $1.5 million in 2014.\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2014 decreased by $1.5 million, or 7.1%, from 2013 primarily due to lower restructuring and acquisition costs. Restructuring and acquisition related costs were $1.5 million in 2014, compared to $2.2 million in 2013.\nInterest Income (Expense), Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), and Other Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table sets forth interest income (expense), net, foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net and other income (expense), net for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,180\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,096\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,468\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,301\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposal of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nNet interest expense was $5.2 million in 2015 versus $5.1 million in the prior year. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.24% and 3.25% during 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $0.9 million and $1.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt.\nThe increase in net interest expense in 2014 versus the prior year was the result of higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates during 2014. The higher debt levels in 2014 were the result of borrowings to fund the JADAK acquisition in March 2014. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.25% and 2.83% during 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.0 million and $0.9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt.\nForeign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net\nForeign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were less than $0.1 million net losses in 2015 versus $1.3 million net gains for the prior year due to changes in the U.S. Dollar exchange rates against the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen and a $1.3 million foreign currency loss related to the cash proceeds in U.S. dollars from the JK Lasers divestiture being held for a period of time by our UK subsidiary.\nForeign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $1.3 million net gains in 2014 versus $1.3 million net losses for the prior year due to the performance of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe recognized $2.6 million, $2.7 million and $1.5 million of other income in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to earnings from our equity-method investment in Laser Quantum. Other income increased from 2013 to 2014 due to higher earnings from our equity-method investment in Laser Quantum and an increase in our ownership percentage from 25.1% to 41.2% during the second quarter of 2013.\nThe summarized financial information for Laser Quantum is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGain on Disposal of Business\nThe gain on disposal of business in 2015 was due to a $19.6 million gain recognized as a result of the JK Lasers divestiture in April 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded a tax provision of $10.4 million in 2015, as compared to a tax benefit of $1.0 million in 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 22.6% of income before taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 5.6% of loss before taxes for 2014. Our effective tax\nrate in 2015 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 27.0% primarily due to a $1.4 million benefit from the JK Lasers divestiture, a $0.7 million benefit associated with R&D tax credits generated during the year, a $0.7 million IRS audit settlement related impact and a decrease of $0.6 million valuation allowance recorded in the U.S.\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $1.0 million in 2014, as compared to a tax expense of $6.2 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 5.6% of loss before taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 38.3% of income before taxes for 2013. Our effective tax rate in 2014 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 27.0% primarily due to $4.6 million additional valuation allowance on net operating losses in Canada and certain other jurisdictions, which was partially offset by $1.1 million of international tax rate differences and a $1.7 million benefit associated with R&D tax credits generated during the year.\nAs a significant portion of the NDS goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge was recognized in Canada, we had a $20.2 million loss before taxes in Canada in 2014 where we do not recognize any tax benefit as a result of the full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. This significantly reduced the income tax benefit as a percentage of the loss before taxes as reported in the consolidated statement of operations for 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was less than $0.1 million and $7.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was primarily due to losses related to the Scientific Lasers business, which was sold in July 2014.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $7.3 million and $2.7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was primarily due to the sale of the Scientific Lasers business, which resulted in a $3.0 million fair value write-down of the Scientific Lasers business and an impairment charge of $0.5 million in connection with our joint venture investment in Excel Laser Technology Private Limited, which is part of our Scientific Lasers business.\nIn July 2014, we completed the sale of the Scientific Lasers business for $6.5 million in cash, net of working capital adjustments. We recorded a $1.7 million loss on the sale, net of tax, in the consolidated statement of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest expense. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility provides an additional potential source of liquidity should it be required for business acquisitions. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nSignificant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, and market changes in general. See Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. We cannot assure you that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary.\nIn October 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan under which the Company may repurchase outstanding shares of the Company's common stock up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million. The shares may be repurchased from time to time, at the Company's discretion, based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company's common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be purchased when the Company would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The share repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the share repurchase program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to fund the share repurchase through cash on hand and future cash flow from operations. During 2015, the Company repurchased 122 thousand shares in the open market for an aggregate\npurchase price of $1.6 million at an average price of $13.29 per share. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 172 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.2 million at an average price of $12.48 per share.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $35.2 million of our $60.0 million cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States and Canada. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries. However, in certain instances, we have identified excess cash for which we may repatriate and have established liabilities for the expected tax cost. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries.\nAmended and Restated Credit Agreement\nIn December 2012, we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d), consisting of a $50.0 million, 5-year term loan facility and a $75.0 million, 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2017. In February 2014, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $100 million from $75 million to $175 million and resets the accordion feature to $100 million for future expansion. Additionally, the Fourth Amendment increased the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio financial covenant from 2.75 to 3.00.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had term loans of $27.5 million and revolving loans of $70.0 million outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum allowed leverage ratio, and a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenant requirements as stated in the Fourth Amendment and our compliance therewith as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Requirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum consolidated leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various other customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including: (i) limitations on certain payments; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens.\nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $60.0 million at December 31, 2015, versus $51.1 million at December 31, 2014. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily related to cash inflows from operating activities of $33.4 million, net cash proceeds of $29.6 million from the sale of our JK Lasers business, and borrowings of $13.0 million under our Senior Credit Facilities. These inflows were offset by cash outflows of $26.0 million for the acquisition of Applimotion, Lincoln Laser and Skyetek, repayments of our debt of $30.5 million, and capital expenditures of $5.6 million.\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows and unused and available funds on our revolving credit facility for the years indicated (in thousands):\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,842\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (93,541\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (85,297\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,535\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 95,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $33.4 million in 2015 versus $44.0 million in 2014. Income from continuing operations increased in 2015 while changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations by $6.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding from 53 days at December 31, 2014 to 57 days at December 31, 2015, a decrease in our days payables outstanding from 45 days at December 31, 2014 to 41 days at December 31, 2015 and an increase in inventories (excluding inventories sold as part of JK Lasers divestiture and inventories from the Applimotion, Lincoln Laser and Skyetek acquisitions). The Company's days sales outstanding was impacted by the timing of sales occurring later in the fourth quarter in 2015 compared to 2014.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $44.0 million in 2014 versus $56.2 million in 2013. Cash provided operating activities of continuing operations decreased $12.2 million primarily due to net tax refunds of $11.8 million received in 2013 as a result of the settlement with the IRS. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was positively impacted by a decrease in our days sales outstanding from 56 at December 31, 2013 to 53 at December 31, 2014 and a decrease in inventories excluding inventories from the JADAK acquisition. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was negatively impacted by a decrease in our days payables outstanding from 48 at December 31, 2013 to 45 at December 31, 2014.\nCash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was less than $0.1 million in 2015 as a result of the sale of our Scientific Lasers business in July 2014. Cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was $1.7 million and $7.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The $5.3 million decrease in cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations in 2014 from 2013 was primarily related to the divestiture of the Scientific Lasers business in 2014 and divestiture of the Semiconductor Systems business in 2013.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $1.8 million during 2015 primarily due to cash consideration of $26.0 million paid for the Applimotion, Lincoln Laser and Skyetek acquisitions and $5.6 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $29.6 million in cash proceeds received from the sale of the JK Lasers business.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $93.5 million during 2014 primarily due to cash consideration of $93.7 million paid for the JADAK acquisition in March 2014 and $5.4 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds of $5.4 million from an escrow claim related to the NDS acquisition. This compares to cash used in investing activities of continuing operations of $85.3 million in 2013 primarily related to cash consideration of $80.8 million paid for the NDS acquisition and $4.8 million in capital expenditures.\nCash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations was $0.2 million during 2015 primarily related to net cash proceeds from the sale of Excel Laser Technology Private Limited (the India JV\u201d). Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations was $3.8 million during 2014, primarily related to $4.7 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Scientific Lasers business, offset by capital expenditures of $0.9 million. This compares to cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2013 of $12.3 million, primarily related to $8.2 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Semiconductor Systems business and $4.6 million in net proceeds from the sale of our East Setauket, New York facility which was part of our Scientific Lasers business.\nWe have no material commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment and expect such expenditures to be approximately $6 million to $7 million in 2016.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nCash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $21.5 million during 2015, primarily due to $7.5 million of our contractual term loan payments, $23.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the repurchase of $1.6 million of the Company's common stock, offset by $13.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the Applimotion acquisition. Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $40.3 million during 2014, primarily due to $77.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to pay a portion of the cash consideration paid for the JADAK acquisition, partially offset by $7.5 million of our contractual term loan payments and $26.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $18.6 million during 2013, primarily due to $60.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to pay for the NDS\nacquisition, partially offset by $7.5 million of our contractual term loan payments and $31.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nWe expect to use $8.5 million of cash in 2016 for financing activities, comprised of quarterly contractual payments of $1.9 million on our term loan facility, and $1.0 million in principal payments for our capital lease obligations. In addition, from time to time we may make payments to pay down our revolving credit facility with future cash flows generated from operating activities.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nPension Plans\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. (the U.K. Plan\u201d). Our U.K. Plan was closed to new members in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, thereby limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees' years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the Guarantee\u201d) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities under the U.K. Plan (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) of GSI Group Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of GSI Group Inc.\nOur funding policy is to fund pensions based on actuarial methods as permitted by regulatory authorities. The results of funding valuations depend on both the funding deficit and the assumptions that we make with regard to attributes such as asset returns, discount rates, mortality, retail price inflation and other market driven changes. The assumptions used represent one estimate of a possible future outcome. The final cost to us will be determined by events as they actually become known. Due to the underfunded positions that our U.K. Plan currently has and potential changes in the actual outcomes relative to our assumptions, we may have to increase payments to fund this plan in the future. As of December 31, 2015, the projected benefit obligation under the U.K. Plan exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $3.5 million.\nBased on the results of the most recent valuation completed in the fourth quarter 2015, the Company's annual contributions will be approximately $1.0 million per year in 2016 and will increase by 2.9% per year thereafter.\nAs a result of the covenant that exists between our U.K. subsidiary and the Plan Trustees regarding the funding of the U.K. Plan, our ability to transfer assets outside our U.K. subsidiary, and its wholly owned subsidiary in China, may be limited.\nOur defined benefit pension plan in Japan was terminated in the first quarter of 2015. The accrued retirement allowance amount calculated in accordance with Japanese retirement benefit rules on a voluntary retirement basis as of March 1, 2015 is being transferred to each employee's new defined contribution plan account over 4 years.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future years. We have excluded the future cash payments for unrecognized tax benefits of $6.1 million, including interest and penalties, because we are uncertain if and when such amounts may be settled. These unrecognized tax benefits have been classified as long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and have been further explained in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017-2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Credit Facilities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on Senior Credit Facilities (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.K. pension plan (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2015, a total of $27.5 million of term loan debt and $70.0 million of revolving credit facility borrowings were outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, assessment of the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, employee benefit plans, restructuring charges, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for loss contingencies. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates in the future.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult and subjective judgments.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when we meet all four of the criteria for revenue recognition within the fiscal period. These criteria are: evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the price is fixed or determinable; and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue recognition requires judgment and estimates, which may affect the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any given period.\nThe Laser Products, Vision Technologies, and Precision Motion segments have revenue transactions that are comprised of both single-element and multiple-element transactions. Multiple-element transactions typically include two or more products and occasionally contain non-standard/extended warranties, or preventative maintenance plans. For multiple-element transactions, revenue is generally recognized upon shipment, using the relative selling price method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605-25 Revenue - Multiple-Element Arrangements\u201d. Single-element transactions are typically recognized upon shipment at their contractually stated prices.\nThe Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Laser Products and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision Technologies segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450 Contingencies\u201d, as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company's estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent the Company experiences warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims that differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting entry recorded to cost of revenue.\nThe Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans, which are accounted for in accordance with provisions of ASC 605-20-25-3, Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts\u201d. Under this guidance, we recognize the separately priced extended/non-standard warranty and preventative maintenance fees ratably over the associated period.\nThe Company, at the request of its customers, may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers. These services are usually in the form of time and materials based contracts which are short in duration. Revenue for time and materials services is recorded at the completion of services requested under a customer's purchase order.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d which delayed effective date of ASU 2014-09 to the first annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, however, no earlier than the original effective date of the first reporting period after December 15, 2016 under ASU 2014-09. Upon adoption, an entity may apply the new guidance either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or using modified retrospective approach which will result in the recording of the cumulative effect of applying the standard to customer contracts not yet completed as of the date of adoption in the beginning retained earnings balance at the date of the initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nInventories. Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or market, using a first-in, first-out method. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in inventory value below cost are caused by technological obsolescence of the inventory.\nWe regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our forecasted product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historical levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, which would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of revenue and higher income from operations than expected in that period.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies is allocated first to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value. Any excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill. We make various assumptions and estimates in order to assign fair value to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. These assumptions typically include cash flow forecasts, discount rates, technology royalty rates, and customer attrition rates, among others. Actual cash flows may vary from forecasts used to value these assets at the time of the business combination.\nOur most significant identifiable intangible assets are customer relationships, acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names. In addition to our review of the carrying value of each asset, the useful life assumption for each asset, including the classification of certain intangible assets as indefinite lived,\u201d are reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized.\nImpairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.\u201d We test our goodwill balances annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. Should the fair value of the Company's goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment loss may be necessary. In performing the test, we utilize the two-step approach which requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of our reporting units to the fair value of these reporting units. The Company's product lines generally correspond with its reporting units which is the level at which the Company evaluates its goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and compare it to the carrying value. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is primarily based on a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) method. The DCF approach requires that we forecast future cash flows for each of the reporting units and discount the cash flow streams based on a weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) that is derived, in part, from comparable companies within similar industries. The DCF calculations also include a terminal value calculation that is based upon an expected long-term growth rate for the applicable reporting unit. The carrying values of each reporting unit include assets and liabilities which relate to the reporting unit's operations. Additionally, reporting units that benefit from corporate assets or liabilities are allocated a portion of those corporate assets and liabilities on a proportional basis.\nWe assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. We also periodically reassess their continuing classification as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value.\nWe evaluate amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,\u201d whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that carrying values may exceed their undiscounted cash flow forecasts. If undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicate that the carrying value of a definite-lived\nintangible asset or other long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a fair value assessment is performed. For intangible assets, fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow forecasts. For other long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment), fair value estimates are derived from the sources most appropriate for the particular asset and have historically included such approaches as sales comparison approach and replacement cost approach. If fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. We also review the useful life and residual value assumptions for definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them.\nFactors which may trigger an impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets include the following:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> negative industry or economic trends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> interest rate changes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> technological changes or developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> changes in competition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> loss of key customers or personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> adverse judicial or legislative outcomes or political developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the decline of our market capitalization below net book value as of the end of any reporting period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe occurrence of any of these events or any other unforeseeable events or circumstances that materially affects future operating results or cash flows may cause an impairment that is material to our results of operations or financial position in the reporting period in which it occurs or is identified.\nThe most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2015, noting no impairment. With the exception of our NDS reporting unit, implied fair values of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 20%. As of December 31, 2015, there were no indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets.\nWe maintain a significant balance in our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The following table shows the breakdown of goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment by reportable segment as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Intangible Assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Property, Plant & Equipment, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laser Products\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vision Technologies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Precision Motion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContingent Consideration. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies may include a contingent consideration obligation. Contingent consideration is typically measured at fair value at the acquisition date using the Monte Carlo valuation method, and is payable to the former shareholders of the acquired company based on the achievement of certain performance targets. Any increases or decreases in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. As of December 31, 2015, the Company may have to pay up to $10.3 million contingent consideration related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded an estimated fair value of $3.9 million contingent consideration obligations relating to its acquisitions of Skyetek, Lincoln Laser and Applimotion.\nPension Plans. Our subsidiary located in the U.K. maintains a defined benefit pension plan (the U.K. Plan\u201d). The U.K. Plan was closed to new membership in 1997 and stopped accruing for additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees' years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. At December 31, 2015, the fair market value of the plan assets was $32.4 million, which was $3.5 million, or 9.9%, less than the projected benefit obligation of $35.9 million.\nThe cost and obligations of our U.K. Plan are calculated using many assumptions. Major assumptions used in the accounting for this pension plan include the discount rate, rate of inflation, mortality rate and expected return on plan assets. Assumptions are determined each year based on data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with a third-party actuary. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension cost and the unfunded benefit obligation at year end. The most sensitive assumption affecting the determination of our U.K. Plan pension obligation is the discount rate. A 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate as of December 31, 2015 would change the pension obligation by $3.3 million.\nRestructuring Charges. In accounting for our restructuring activities, we follow the provisions of ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations\u201d. In accounting for these obligations, we make assumptions related to the amount of employee severance and benefits related costs, the time period over which facilities will remain vacant, sublease terms, sublease rates, and discount rates. Additionally, we make assumptions on the estimated remaining useful lives of assets being restructured and the residual value of the assets. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation has arisen. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate. Changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the amount previously expensed against our earnings and currently accrued on our consolidated balance sheet.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on our consolidated balance sheet.\nJudgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate outcome is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would be recorded and would increase our net income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets will be recorded and will reduce our net income in the period such determination is made.\nIn conjunction with our ongoing review of our actual results and anticipated future earnings, we continuously reassess the possibility of increasing the valuation allowance currently in place on our deferred tax assets. We released $0.8 million valuation allowance against state net operating loss carryforwards during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of our valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Based on historical operating income and continuing projected income, future reversals of temporary differences and tax planning strategies, we have concluded that sufficient negative evidence indicates that it is not more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or resolved, or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires. As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $5.5 million, of which $4.1 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2014, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $6.3, of which $4.1 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. Over the next twelve months, the Company may need to record up to $1.2 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in the event of statute of limitations closures.\nIncome and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $18.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The estimated unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on this temporary difference is approximately $0.4 million.\nLoss Contingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to labor, service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We expense legal fees as incurred.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us.",

The decrease, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was related to a decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets from prior year acquisitions.\nOperating Expenses\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $60.0 million at December 31, 2015, versus $51.1 million at December 31, 2014. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily related to cash inflows from operating activities of $33.4 million, net cash proceeds of $29.6 million from the sale of our JK Lasers business, and borrowings of $13.0 million under our Senior Credit Facilities. These inflows were offset by cash outflows of $26.0 million for the acquisition of Applimotion, Lincoln Laser and Skyetek, repayments of our debt of $30.5 million, and capital expenditures of $5.6 million.\n2015 Restructuring\nrate in 2015 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 27.0% primarily due to a $1.4 million benefit from the JK Lasers divestiture, a $0.7 million benefit associated with R&D tax credits generated during the year, a $0.7 million IRS audit settlement related impact and a decrease of $0.6 million valuation allowance recorded in the U.S.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $33.4 million in 2015 versus $44.0 million in 2014. Income from continuing operations increased in 2015 while changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations by $6.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding from 53 days at December 31, 2014 to 57 days at December 31, 2015, a decrease in our days payables outstanding from 45 days at December 31, 2014 to 41 days at December 31, 2015 and an increase in inventories (excluding inventories sold as part of JK Lasers divestiture and inventories from the Applimotion, Lincoln Laser and Skyetek acquisitions). The Company's days sales outstanding was impacted by the timing of sales occurring later in the fourth quarter in 2015 compared to 2014.\nInventories. Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or market, using a first-in, first-out method. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in inventory value below cost are caused by technological obsolescence of the inventory.\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,180\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,096\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,468\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,301\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposal of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn conjunction with our ongoing review of our actual results and anticipated future earnings, we continuously reassess the possibility of increasing the valuation allowance currently in place on our deferred tax assets. We released $0.8 million valuation allowance against state net operating loss carryforwards during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of our valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Based on historical operating income and continuing projected income, future reversals of temporary differences and tax planning strategies, we have concluded that sufficient negative evidence indicates that it is not more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized.\nThe occurrence of any of these events or any other unforeseeable events or circumstances that materially affects future operating results or cash flows may cause an impairment that is material to our results of operations or financial position in the reporting period in which it occurs or is identified.\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,842\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (93,541\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (85,297\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,535\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 95,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u00b7 negative industry or economic trends; \nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Change attributable to acquisitions and divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Plus: Change due to foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Organic growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrecision Motion segment gross profit for 2015 increased $8.4 million, or 29.6%, versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue and gross profit margin.

Assumptions are determined each year based on data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with a third-party actuary. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension cost and the unfunded benefit obligation at year end. The most sensitive assumption affecting the determination of our U.K. Plan pension obligation is the discount rate.

The amounts include payments due with respect to both active operating facilities and idle facilities that have been vacated as a result of our restructuring actions. \nLaser Products segment revenue in 2014 increased by $11.1 million, or 6.7%, versus the prior year, due to growth across all product lines. The revenue growth was primarily due to an increase in revenue of our CO2 lasers and fiber lasers products, driven by new product launches, new customer wins, and market growth. In addition, revenue of our laser beam delivery products grew due to increased demand in material processing in advanced industrial markets and certain medical applications.\nForeign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net\nLaser Products segment revenue in 2015 decreased by $9.4 million, or 5.3%, versus the prior year, as a result of the JK Lasers divestiture, which reduced segment revenues by $16.7 million, partially offset by an increase in revenue of our laser beam delivery and CO2 laser products due to an increase in demand in the advanced industrial market and certain medical applications and the Lincoln Laser acquisition.\nLaser Products\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems and executive management.\n - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; \nRestructuring, acquisition and divestiture related charges primarily relate to our restructuring programs, acquisition related costs incurred for the acquisition of Skyetek in December 2015, Lincoln Laser in November 2015, Applimotion in February 2015, JADAK in March 2014 and NDS in January 2013. Acquisition related costs also include costs related to future potential acquisitions, failed acquisitions and changes in fair value of contingent considerations. Divestiture costs primarily related to the JK Lasers divestiture in April 2015.\nIn October 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan under which the Company may repurchase outstanding shares of the Company's common stock up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million. The shares may be repurchased from time to time, at the Company's discretion, based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company's common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be purchased when the Company would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The share repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the share repurchase program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to fund the share repurchase through cash on hand and future cash flow from operations. During 2015, the Company repurchased 122 thousand shares in the open market for an aggregate\nForeign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $1.3 million net gains in 2014 versus $1.3 million net losses for the prior year due to the performance of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen.\nAcquisition of Applimotion\nCash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $21.5 million during 2015, primarily due to $7.5 million of our contractual term loan payments, $23.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the repurchase of $1.6 million of the Company's common stock, offset by $13.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the Applimotion acquisition. Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $40.3 million during 2014, primarily due to $77.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to pay a portion of the cash consideration paid for the JADAK acquisition, partially offset by $7.5 million of our contractual term loan payments and $26.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $18.6 million during 2013, primarily due to $60.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to pay for the NDS\nLaser Products segment gross profit in 2015 decreased $0.6 million, or 0.8%, versus the prior year primarily due to a decline in revenue as a result of the JK Lasers divestiture, which decreased gross profit by $4.9 million, partially offset by revenue growth in our laser beam delivery and CO2 laser products and an increase in gross profit margin. Laser Products segment gross profit margin was 43.7% for 2015, compared with a gross profit margin of 41.8% for the prior year. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the JK Lasers divestiture, which accounted for 1.3 percentage point of the 1.9 percentage point increase. The remaining increase in gross profit margin was driven by increases in volume in our laser beam delivery and CO2 laser products, product mix, and continuous improvement productivity initiatives.\nSee Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had term loans of $27.5 million and revolving loans of $70.0 million outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nIn July 2014, we completed the sale of the Scientific Lasers business for $6.5 million in cash, net of working capital adjustments. We recorded a $1.7 million loss on the sale, net of tax, in the consolidated statement of operations.\nLaser Products operating income from continuing operations for 2015 increased by $2.9 million, or 8.8%, from 2014 primarily due to the improved profitability of the Laser Products segment after the JK Lasers divestiture, partially offset by an increase in restructuring and divestiture related costs of $1.7 million. Amortization of intangible assets for the Laser Products segment was $4.4 million in 2015 compared to $4.1 million in 2014.\n \u00b7 increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial technology applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, automation, metrology, and micromachining, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; \n (2) For the purpose of this calculation, current interest rates on floating rate obligation (LIBOR plus applicable margin, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) were used for the remainder contractual life of the term loan. \nDiscontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $7.3 million and $2.7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was primarily due to the sale of the Scientific Lasers business, which resulted in a $3.0 million fair value write-down of the Scientific Lasers business and an impairment charge of $0.5 million in connection with our joint venture investment in Excel Laser Technology Private Limited, which is part of our Scientific Lasers business.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nImpairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.\u201d We test our goodwill balances annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. Should the fair value of the Company's goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment loss may be necessary. In performing the test, we utilize the two-step approach which requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of our reporting units to the fair value of these reporting units. The Company's product lines generally correspond with its reporting units which is the level at which the Company evaluates its goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and compare it to the carrying value. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is primarily based on a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) method. The DCF approach requires that we forecast future cash flows for each of the reporting units and discount the cash flow streams based on a weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) that is derived, in part, from comparable companies within similar industries. The DCF calculations also include a terminal value calculation that is based upon an expected long-term growth rate for the applicable reporting unit. The carrying values of each reporting unit include assets and liabilities which relate to the reporting unit's operations. Additionally, reporting units that benefit from corporate assets or liabilities are allocated a portion of those corporate assets and liabilities on a proportional basis.\n \u00b7 improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: \nPrecision Motion\nAmended and Restated Credit Agreement\n \u00b7 broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; \nJK Lasers Divestiture\n (4) Purchase commitments represent unconditional purchase obligations as of December 31, 2015. \nLaser Products\nVision Technologies segment revenue in 2014 increased by $31.9 million, or 35.3%, versus the prior year. A $45.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the JADAK acquisition was partially offset by a decline in revenue in our visualization solutions products as a result of dual sourcing at an OEM customer that began in 2013, softness in medical equipment spending impacting our customer's demand for our products, and delays in new product introductions.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the years indicated:\nPrecision Motion segment gross profit for 2014 increased $0.6 million, or 2.0%, versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue volume of our optical encoders products. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 43.7% for 2014, compared with a gross profit margin of 46.3% for the prior year. The 2.6 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin was a consequence of manufacturing ramp-up costs.\n\nThe Laser Products, Vision Technologies, and Precision Motion segments have revenue transactions that are comprised of both single-element and multiple-element transactions. Multiple-element transactions typically include two or more products and occasionally contain non-standard/extended warranties, or preventative maintenance plans. For multiple-element transactions, revenue is generally recognized upon shipment, using the relative selling price method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605-25 Revenue - Multiple-Element Arrangements\u201d. Single-element transactions are typically recognized upon shipment at their contractually stated prices.\nThe most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2015, noting no impairment. With the exception of our NDS reporting unit, implied fair values of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 20%. As of December 31, 2015, there were no indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets.\nCash Flows\nStrategy\nOn February 19, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Applimotion Inc. ( Applimotion\u201d), a Loomis, California based provider of advanced precision motor and motion control technology to OEM customers in the medical and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of $14.0 million, net of working capital adjustments. This total purchase price includes $13.0 million in cash paid for the acquisition and $1.0 million in estimated fair value of future contingent considerations payable upon the achievement of certain revenue targets for the fiscal years 2015 to 2017. The undiscounted range of contingent considerations is zero to $4.0 million. Applimotion specializes in motor applications that require highly precise and dynamic motion control. The acquisition enhances our strategic position in precision motion control by enabling us to offer a broader range of motion control technologies and integrated solutions. Applimotion is included in the Company's Precision Motion reportable segment.\n\nForeign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were less than $0.1 million net losses in 2015 versus $1.3 million net gains for the prior year due to changes in the U.S. Dollar exchange rates against the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen and a $1.3 million foreign currency loss related to the cash proceeds in U.S. dollars from the JK Lasers divestiture being held for a period of time by our UK subsidiary.\nPrecision Motion operating income from continuing operations for 2014 increased by $1.0 million, or 8.0%, from 2013 primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $0.6 million and a $0.4 million decrease in restructuring costs.\nVision Technologies operating loss from continuing operations decreased by $41.0 million from an operating loss of $43.1 million in 2014 to an operating loss of $2.1 million in 2015 primarily due to the NDS goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge recorded in 2014 and a decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles of $4.8 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses as a result of the 2014 JADAK acquisition and an increase in restructuring charges related to our 2016 restructuring program.\nCash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was less than $0.1 million in 2015 as a result of the sale of our Scientific Lasers business in July 2014. Cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was $1.7 million and $7.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The $5.3 million decrease in cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations in 2014 from 2013 was primarily related to the divestiture of the Scientific Lasers business in 2014 and divestiture of the Semiconductor Systems business in 2013.\nPrecision Motion operating income from continuing operations for 2015 increased by $3.9 million, or 29.6%, from 2014 primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $8.4 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses due to the Applimotion acquisition and an increase in restructuring charges related to our 2016 restructuring program.\nDiluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) from continuing operations increased $1.51 from a loss per share of ($0.49) in 2014 to an earnings per share of $1.02 in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to operating income from continuing operations in 2015 versus operating loss from continuing operations in the prior year and higher other income resulting from the gain recognized from the JK Lasers divestiture.\n - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, diagnostic testing and life science research; \nWe have no material commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment and expect such expenditures to be approximately $6 million to $7 million in 2016.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nVision Technologies segment gross profit for 2014 increased $12.9 million, or 35.9%, versus the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the JADAK acquisition in March 2014, which accounted for an $18.9 million increase in gross profit year over year, partially offset by a decline in gross profit for our visualization solutions products due to lower revenue. Vision Technologies segment gross profit margin remained relatively flat year over year. Included in gross profit was amortization of developed technologies and amortization of inventory fair value step-ups of $3.7 million and $3.1 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on our consolidated balance sheet.\nR&D expenses were $29.0 million, or 7.9% of revenue, in 2014, versus $23.8 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in 2013. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to the acquisition of JADAK.\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest expense. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility provides an additional potential source of liquidity should it be required for business acquisitions. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nResults of Operations\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe gain on disposal of business in 2015 was due to a $19.6 million gain recognized as a result of the JK Lasers divestiture in April 2015.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $1.8 million during 2015 primarily due to cash consideration of $26.0 million paid for the Applimotion, Lincoln Laser and Skyetek acquisitions and $5.6 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $29.6 million in cash proceeds received from the sale of the JK Lasers business.\nOur funding policy is to fund pensions based on actuarial methods as permitted by regulatory authorities. The results of funding valuations depend on both the funding deficit and the assumptions that we make with regard to attributes such as asset returns, discount rates, mortality, retail price inflation and other market driven changes. The assumptions used represent one estimate of a possible future outcome. The final cost to us will be determined by events as they actually become known. Due to the underfunded positions that our U.K. Plan currently has and potential changes in the actual outcomes relative to our assumptions, we may have to increase payments to fund this plan in the future. As of December 31, 2015, the projected benefit obligation under the U.K. Plan exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $3.5 million.\nAs a result of the covenant that exists between our U.K. subsidiary and the Plan Trustees regarding the funding of the U.K. Plan, our ability to transfer assets outside our U.K. subsidiary, and its wholly owned subsidiary in China, may be limited.\nGSI Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Company\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, our\u201d) design, develop, manufacture and sell precision photonic and motion control components and subsystems to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM's) in the medical equipment and advanced industrial technology markets. Our highly engineered enabling technologies include laser sources, laser scanning and beam delivery products, optical data collection and machine vision technologies, medical visualization and informatics solutions, and precision motion control products. We specialize in collaborating with OEM customers to adapt our component and subsystem technologies to deliver highly differentiated performance in their applications.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the Company initiated a program targeting annualized savings of $4.5 million to $5.5 million after the program is fully executed. The 2016 restructuring program includes consolidating our manufacturing operations to optimize our facility footprint and to better utilize resources, and reducing redundant costs due to productivity cost savings and business volume reductions. The Company expects to incur cash charges of $4.5 million to $5.5 million related to this program, which we anticipate completing during the second quarter of 2016. The Company incurred costs related to the 2016 restructuring program amounting to $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, assessment of the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, employee benefit plans, restructuring charges, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for loss contingencies. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates in the future.\nRevenue\nOur strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nThe Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Laser Products and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision Technologies segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450 Contingencies\u201d, as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company's estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent the Company experiences warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims that differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting entry recorded to cost of revenue.\nResearch and development and engineering ( R&D\u201d) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects.\n \u00b7 changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; \n \u00b7 technological changes or developments; \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOn November 9, 2015, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of Lincoln Laser Company ( Lincoln Laser\u201d), a Phoenix, Arizona-based provider of ultrafast precision polygon scanners and other optical scanning solutions for the medical, food processing, and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of $12.6 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. This total purchase price includes $10.3 million in cash paid for the acquisition and $2.3 million in estimated fair value of future contingent consideration payable upon the achievement of certain revenue targets for fiscal year 2016. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to $6.0 million. Lincoln Laser specializes in ultrafast scanning, leveraging their expertise in polygon motor design and electro-optic subsystems. The acquisition creates an expanded range of highly competitive beam delivery technologies for the Company. The Lincoln Laser business is included in the Company's Laser Products reportable segment.\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2014 decreased by $1.5 million, or 7.1%, from 2013 primarily due to lower restructuring and acquisition costs. Restructuring and acquisition related costs were $1.5 million in 2014, compared to $2.2 million in 2013.\n\nOverview of Financial Results\nOn December 18, 2015, the Company acquired all assets and certain liabilities of Skyetek, Inc. ( Skyetek\u201d), a Denver, Colorado-based provider of embedded and standalone RFID Solutions for medical OEM's, for a total purchase price of $2.8 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. This total purchase price includes $2.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition and $0.2 million in estimated fair value of future contingent consideration payable upon the achievement of certain sales order commitment targets from October 2015 through June 2017. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to $0.3 million. Skyetek specializes in high-performing HF and UHF RFID technologies that maximize efficiency and visibility for OEM's serving the medical and advanced industrial markets. The acquisition creates an expanded range of highly competitive RFID solutions that significantly enhances our value proposition to OEM customers in various industries, but especially within the healthcare industry where there is an ever-growing need for improvements in workflow solutions, patient safety, anti-counterfeiting, and asset tracking throughout the hospital environment. The Skyetek business is included in the Company's Vision Technologies reportable segment.\nWe recognized $2.6 million, $2.7 million and $1.5 million of other income in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to earnings from our equity-method investment in Laser Quantum. Other income increased from 2013 to 2014 due to higher earnings from our equity-method investment in Laser Quantum and an increase in our ownership percentage from 25.1% to 41.2% during the second quarter of 2013.\n \u00b7 adverse judicial or legislative outcomes or political developments; \nLoss Contingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to labor, service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We expense legal fees as incurred.\nAs a significant portion of the NDS goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge was recognized in Canada, we had a $20.2 million loss before taxes in Canada in 2014 where we do not recognize any tax benefit as a result of the full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. This significantly reduced the income tax benefit as a percentage of the loss before taxes as reported in the consolidated statement of operations for 2014.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $93.5 million during 2014 primarily due to cash consideration of $93.7 million paid for the JADAK acquisition in March 2014 and $5.4 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds of $5.4 million from an escrow claim related to the NDS acquisition. This compares to cash used in investing activities of continuing operations of $85.3 million in 2013 primarily related to cash consideration of $80.8 million paid for the NDS acquisition and $4.8 million in capital expenditures.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nWe expect to use $8.5 million of cash in 2016 for financing activities, comprised of quarterly contractual payments of $1.9 million on our term loan facility, and $1.0 million in principal payments for our capital lease obligations. In addition, from time to time we may make payments to pay down our revolving credit facility with future cash flows generated from operating activities.\nOperating Income (Loss) by Segment\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOur defined benefit pension plan in Japan was terminated in the first quarter of 2015. The accrued retirement allowance amount calculated in accordance with Japanese retirement benefit rules on a voluntary retirement basis as of March 1, 2015 is being transferred to each employee's new defined contribution plan account over 4 years.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $10.3 million, or 2.8% of revenue, in 2014, versus $7.3 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2013. The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets from the JADAK acquisition.\nSignificant Events and Updates\nOperating income from continuing operations increased $45.7 million from an operating loss of $16.8 million in 2014 to operating income of $28.9 million in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an impairment charge of $41.4 million related to the NDS business in 2014 and an increase in gross profit in 2015.\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared service functions and other public company costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs.\nIn December 2012, we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d), consisting of a $50.0 million, 5-year term loan facility and a $75.0 million, 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2017. In February 2014, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $100 million from $75 million to $175 million and resets the accordion feature to $100 million for future expansion. Additionally, the Fourth Amendment increased the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio financial covenant from 2.75 to 3.00.\n\nThe following table sets forth operating income by segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nThe Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans, which are accounted for in accordance with provisions of ASC 605-20-25-3, Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts\u201d. Under this guidance, we recognize the separately priced extended/non-standard warranty and preventative maintenance fees ratably over the associated period.\nBased on the results of the most recent valuation completed in the fourth quarter 2015, the Company's annual contributions will be approximately $1.0 million per year in 2016 and will increase by 2.9% per year thereafter.\n\nR&D expenses were $31.0 million, or 8.3% of revenue, in 2015, versus $29.0 million, or 7.9% of revenue, in 2014. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by the JK Lasers divestiture.\nPension Plans. Our subsidiary located in the U.K. maintains a defined benefit pension plan (the U.K. Plan\u201d). The U.K. Plan was closed to new membership in 1997 and stopped accruing for additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees' years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. At December 31, 2015, the fair market value of the plan assets was $32.4 million, which was $3.5 million, or 9.9%, less than the projected benefit obligation of $35.9 million.\nThe Company recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $1.9 million in 2014, versus $5.4 million in 2013. The Company recognized acquisition related costs of $1.5 million in 2014, which included expenses of $0.6 million recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with the JADAK acquisition. The decrease in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs is primarily due to the decrease in costs related to restructuring programs in 2014 as compared to 2013. Acquisition related costs were $1.6 million during 2013.\nVision Technologies segment gross profit for 2015 increased $0.3 million, or 0.6%, versus the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to a decline in intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset by product mix. Vision Technologies segment gross profit margin was 39.3% for 2015, compared with a gross profit margin of 39.8% for the prior year. The 0.5 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to product mix, offset by lower intangible asset amortization expense. Included in gross profit for 2015 was amortization of developed technologies of $2.2 million. Included in gross profit for 2014 was amortization of developed technologies and amortization of inventory fair value step-ups of $3.7 million.\n - cross selling our entire product offerings to the leading medical equipment manufacturers; and \nWe regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our forecasted product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historical levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, which would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of revenue and higher income from operations than expected in that period.\nGross profit and gross profit margin can be influenced by a number of factors, including product mix, pricing, volume, manufacturing efficiencies and utilization, costs for raw materials and outsourced manufacturing, headcount, inventory obsolescence and warranty expenses.\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, $35.2 million of our $60.0 million cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States and Canada. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries. However, in certain instances, we have identified excess cash for which we may repatriate and have established liabilities for the expected tax cost. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries.\n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets is charged to our Laser Products, Vision Technologies and Precision Motion segments. Amortization of core technologies is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of customer relationships, trademarks, backlog and other intangibles are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.\nVision Technologies segment revenue in 2015 increased by $2.5 million, or 2.1%, versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to revenue from our optical data collection business being included in reported revenue in the prior year only following the JADAK acquisition in March 2014 and increases in revenue from our thermal printers and light and color measurement products,\nVision Technologies operating income from continuing operations decreased by $46.6 million from operating income of $3.6 million in 2013 to an operating loss of $43.1 million in 2014 primarily due to the NDS goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge of $41.4 million, an increase in amortization of intangibles and amortization of our inventory fair value step-ups of $3.7 million and a decline in visualization solutions revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating income from continuing operations as a result of the JADAK acquisition.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when we meet all four of the criteria for revenue recognition within the fiscal period. These criteria are: evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the price is fixed or determinable; and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue recognition requires judgment and estimates, which may affect the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any given period.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $44.0 million in 2014 versus $56.2 million in 2013. Cash provided operating activities of continuing operations decreased $12.2 million primarily due to net tax refunds of $11.8 million received in 2013 as a result of the settlement with the IRS. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was positively impacted by a decrease in our days sales outstanding from 56 at December 31, 2013 to 53 at December 31, 2014 and a decrease in inventories excluding inventories from the JADAK acquisition. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was negatively impacted by a decrease in our days payables outstanding from 48 at December 31, 2013 to 45 at December 31, 2014.\nSG&A expenses were $82.0 million, or 22.0% of revenue, in 2015, versus $84.4 million, or 23.1% of revenue, in 2014. SG&A expenses decreased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the JK Lasers divestiture and lower compensation expense, partially offset by increases from current year acquisitions and the JADAK acquisition in March 2014.\n\nintangible asset or other long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a fair value assessment is performed. For intangible assets, fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow forecasts. For other long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment), fair value estimates are derived from the sources most appropriate for the particular asset and have historically included such approaches as sales comparison approach and replacement cost approach. If fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. We also review the useful life and residual value assumptions for definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them.\nAcquisition of Lincoln Laser\nThe Company recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $8.3 million in 2015, versus $1.9 million in 2014. The Company recognized acquisition related costs of $1.3 million in 2015. Acquisition related costs included expenses of $1.9 million related to acquisitions in 2015, partially offset by a $0.6 million reversal of accruals for earn-out agreements in connection with the 2014 JADAK acquisition. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $5.8 million primarily related to our restructuring programs and $1.1 million in divestiture costs related to the JK Lasers divestiture. The increase in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs is primarily due to the increase in costs related to restructuring programs in 2015. Acquisition related costs were $1.5 million during 2014.\nPension Plans\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was less than $0.1 million and $7.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was primarily due to losses related to the Scientific Lasers business, which was sold in July 2014.\nThe organic growth in our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to growth in our Laser Products and Precision Motion segments offset by a decline in revenue in our Vision Technologies (formerly known as Medical Technologies) segment. The increase in revenue in our Laser Products segment was attributable to an increase in revenue from our laser beam delivery and CO2 lasers products. The growth in our Precision Motion segment was driven by an increase in revenue of optical encoders products, partially offset by a decline in revenue from our air bearing spindles products. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Vision Technologies segment related to our visualization solutions product line.\nLaser Products operating income from continuing operations for 2014 increased by $7.9 million, or 31.5%, from 2013 primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $5.4 million and a $2.0 million decrease in restructuring and acquisition related charges compared to 2013. Amortization of intangible assets for the Laser Products segment was $4.1 million in both 2014 and 2013.\n (5) Assumes funding obligations equivalent to $1.0 million per year, increasing 2.9% through 2021 based on annual funding contributions in effect as of December 31, 2015. Future funding requirements will be affected by various actuarial assumptions and actual experience of the pension plan. \nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult and subjective judgments.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d which delayed effective date of ASU 2014-09 to the first annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, however, no earlier than the original effective date of the first reporting period after December 15, 2016 under ASU 2014-09. Upon adoption, an entity may apply the new guidance either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or using modified retrospective approach which will result in the recording of the cumulative effect of applying the standard to customer contracts not yet completed as of the date of adoption in the beginning retained earnings balance at the date of the initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum allowed leverage ratio, and a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenant requirements as stated in the Fourth Amendment and our compliance therewith as of December 31, 2015.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. We cannot assure you that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary.\nFactors which may trigger an impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets include the following:\nInterest Income (Expense), Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), and Other Income (Expense), Net\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various other customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including: (i) limitations on certain payments; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or resolved, or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires. As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $5.5 million, of which $4.1 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2014, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $6.3, of which $4.1 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. Over the next twelve months, the Company may need to record up to $1.2 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in the event of statute of limitations closures.\nJudgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate outcome is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\nVision Technologies\n\nThrough December 31, 2015, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons.\nRestructuring Charges. In accounting for our restructuring activities, we follow the provisions of ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations\u201d. In accounting for these obligations, we make assumptions related to the amount of employee severance and benefits related costs, the time period over which facilities will remain vacant, sublease terms, sublease rates, and discount rates. Additionally, we make assumptions on the estimated remaining useful lives of assets being restructured and the residual value of the assets. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation has arisen. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate. Changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the amount previously expensed against our earnings and currently accrued on our consolidated balance sheet.\nThe following table sets forth the gross profit and gross profit margin for each of our reportable segments for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nAcquisition of Skyetek\nOur most significant identifiable intangible assets are customer relationships, acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names. In addition to our review of the carrying value of each asset, the useful life assumption for each asset, including the classification of certain intangible assets as indefinite lived,\u201d are reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized.\nThe following table sets forth external revenue by reportable segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nTotal revenue for 2015 was $373.6 million, an increase of $8.9 million, or 2.4%, versus the prior year primarily as the net result of our acquisitions and divestitures, which increased revenues by $10.0 million, or 2.8%. Foreign exchange rates adversely impacted our revenue by 4.0% during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in foreign exchange rates, total revenue for 2015 increased 3.6% versus the prior year. Our organic revenue growth is summarized as follows:\npartially offset by a decline in our visualization solutions revenue as a result of our radiology products and customer qualification cycles.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth interest income (expense), net, foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net and other income (expense), net for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nThe summarized financial information for Laser Quantum is as follows (in thousands):\nIncome Taxes\n \u00b7 significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and \nLaser Products\nThe following table sets forth operating expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nGross Profit\n \u00b7 broadening our portfolio of enabling technologies and capabilities through increased new product development investment, expanded sales and marketing channels to reach target customers and, investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; \nWe maintain a significant balance in our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The following table shows the breakdown of goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment by reportable segment as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nThe Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $41.4 million in the consolidated financial statements in 2014 as a result of lower expectations for revenue and operating profit from our NDS business.\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2015 increased by $2.1 million, or 10.4%, from 2014 primarily due to an increase in professional services costs and an increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $1.1 million. Restructuring and acquisition related costs were $2.6 million in 2015, compared to $1.5 million in 2014.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies is allocated first to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value. Any excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill. We make various assumptions and estimates in order to assign fair value to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. These assumptions typically include cash flow forecasts, discount rates, technology royalty rates, and customer attrition rates, among others. Actual cash flows may vary from forecasts used to value these assets at the time of the business combination.\nSignificant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, and market changes in general. See Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and Development and Engineering Expenses\n\n \u00b7 loss of key customers or personnel; \nSG&A expenses were $84.4 million, or 23.1% of revenue, in 2014, versus $76.3 million, or 24.1% of revenue, in 2013. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to the acquisition of JADAK.\nThe increase in net interest expense in 2014 versus the prior year was the result of higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates during 2014. The higher debt levels in 2014 were the result of borrowings to fund the JADAK acquisition in March 2014. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.25% and 2.83% during 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.0 million and $0.9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt.\nContractual Obligations\n\nLaser Products segment gross profit in 2014 increased $5.4 million, or 7.9%, versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue and an increase in gross profit margin. Laser Products segment gross profit margin was 41.8% for 2014, compared with a gross profit margin of 41.3% for the prior year. The 0.5 percentage point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to productivity improvements as a result of our manufacturing process improvement initiatives and margin improvements in our fiber lasers products.\nPrecision Motion segment revenue in 2014 increased by $4.8 million, or 7.9%, versus the prior year. This increase was principally driven by increased revenue of our optical encoders products as a result of a market share gain with a major OEM customer and new customer wins.\nThe Company, at the request of its customers, may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers. These services are usually in the form of time and materials based contracts which are short in duration. Revenue for time and materials services is recorded at the completion of services requested under a customer's purchase order.\nOn April 15, 2015, the Company completed the sale of our JK Lasers business for $29.6 million in cash, net of working capital adjustments and transaction costs, and recognized a $19.6 million pre-tax gain on the sale in the consolidated statement of operations. The JK Lasers business divestiture does not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n \u00b7 the decline of our market capitalization below net book value as of the end of any reporting period. \nDuring the first quarter of 2015, the Company implemented a program to eliminate redundant costs, as a result of acquisition and divestiture activities, to better align our operations to our strategic growth plans, to further integrate our business lines, and as a consequence of our productivity initiatives. The Company substantially completed the program in 2015, incurring costs amounting to $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We principally intend to reallocate resources and reinvest savings from the 2015 restructuring into higher growth businesses and lower cost regions.\n2016 Restructuring\n \u00b7 improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles and strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and \nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows and unused and available funds on our revolving credit facility for the years indicated (in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future years. We have excluded the future cash payments for unrecognized tax benefits of $6.1 million, including interest and penalties, because we are uncertain if and when such amounts may be settled. These unrecognized tax benefits have been classified as long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and have been further explained in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $1.0 million in 2014, as compared to a tax expense of $6.2 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 5.6% of loss before taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 38.3% of income before taxes for 2013. Our effective tax rate in 2014 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 27.0% primarily due to $4.6 million additional valuation allowance on net operating losses in Canada and certain other jurisdictions, which was partially offset by $1.1 million of international tax rate differences and a $1.7 million benefit associated with R&D tax credits generated during the year.\nWe assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. We also periodically reassess their continuing classification as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value.\npurchase price of $1.6 million at an average price of $13.29 per share. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 172 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.2 million at an average price of $12.48 per share.\nPrecision Motion", "item_7_text": "Vision Technologies\nWe record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would be recorded and would increase our net income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets will be recorded and will reduce our net income in the period such determination is made.\nBusiness Overview\nPrecision Motion\nGain on Disposal of Business\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nUnallocated Corporate and Shared Services\n (1) As of December 31, 2015, a total of $27.5 million of term loan debt and $70.0 million of revolving credit facility borrowings were outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities. The term loan is payable in 8 quarterly installments of $1.9 million with the remaining amount due upon maturity in December 2017. The revolving credit facility is due at maturity in December 2017. \nWe evaluate amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,\u201d whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that carrying values may exceed their undiscounted cash flow forecasts. If undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicate that the carrying value of a definite-lived\nFinancing Cash Flows\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization for developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $7.6 million, or 2.0% of revenue, in 2015, versus $10.3 million, or 2.8% of revenue, in 2014. The decrease, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was related to a decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets from prior year acquisitions.\nOperating Expenses\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $60.0 million at December 31, 2015, versus $51.1 million at December 31, 2014. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily related to cash inflows from operating activities of $33.4 million, net cash proceeds of $29.6 million from the sale of our JK Lasers business, and borrowings of $13.0 million under our Senior Credit Facilities. These inflows were offset by cash outflows of $26.0 million for the acquisition of Applimotion, Lincoln Laser and Skyetek, repayments of our debt of $30.5 million, and capital expenditures of $5.6 million.\n2015 Restructuring\nrate in 2015 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 27.0% primarily due to a $1.4 million benefit from the JK Lasers divestiture, a $0.7 million benefit associated with R&D tax credits generated during the year, a $0.7 million IRS audit settlement related impact and a decrease of $0.6 million valuation allowance recorded in the U.S.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $33.4 million in 2015 versus $44.0 million in 2014. Income from continuing operations increased in 2015 while changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations by $6.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding from 53 days at December 31, 2014 to 57 days at December 31, 2015, a decrease in our days payables outstanding from 45 days at December 31, 2014 to 41 days at December 31, 2015 and an increase in inventories (excluding inventories sold as part of JK Lasers divestiture and inventories from the Applimotion, Lincoln Laser and Skyetek acquisitions). The Company's days sales outstanding was impacted by the timing of sales occurring later in the fourth quarter in 2015 compared to 2014.\nInventories. Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or market, using a first-in, first-out method. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in inventory value below cost are caused by technological obsolescence of the inventory.\nIn conjunction with our ongoing review of our actual results and anticipated future earnings, we continuously reassess the possibility of increasing the valuation allowance currently in place on our deferred tax assets. We released $0.8 million valuation allowance against state net operating loss carryforwards during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of our valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Based on historical operating income and continuing projected income, future reversals of temporary differences and tax planning strategies, we have concluded that sufficient negative evidence indicates that it is not more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized.\nThe occurrence of any of these events or any other unforeseeable events or circumstances that materially affects future operating results or cash flows may cause an impairment that is material to our results of operations or financial position in the reporting period in which it occurs or is identified.\n \u00b7 negative industry or economic trends; \nPrecision Motion segment gross profit for 2015 increased $8.4 million, or 29.6%, versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue and gross profit margin. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 45.6% for 2015, compared with a gross profit margin of 43.7% for the prior year. The 1.9 percentage point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to an increase in volumes, product mix and continuous improvement productivity initiatives.\nVision Technologies\nPrecision Motion segment revenue in 2015 increased by $15.7 million, or 24.3%, versus the prior year. This increase was principally driven by the Applimotion acquisition and increased revenue of our optical encoders products as a result of increased customer volumes in both the medical and advanced industrial markets, partially offset by a decline in revenue of our air bearing spindles products due to lower demand from the printed circuit board industry.\nContingent Consideration. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies may include a contingent consideration obligation. Contingent consideration is typically measured at fair value at the acquisition date using the Monte Carlo valuation method, and is payable to the former shareholders of the acquired company based on the achievement of certain performance targets. Any increases or decreases in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. As of December 31, 2015, the Company may have to pay up to $10.3 million contingent consideration related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded an estimated fair value of $3.9 million contingent consideration obligations relating to its acquisitions of Skyetek, Lincoln Laser and Applimotion.\nCash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations was $0.2 million during 2015 primarily related to net cash proceeds from the sale of Excel Laser Technology Private Limited (the India JV\u201d). Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations was $3.8 million during 2014, primarily related to $4.7 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Scientific Lasers business, offset by capital expenditures of $0.9 million. This compares to cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2013 of $12.3 million, primarily related to $8.2 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Semiconductor Systems business and $4.6 million in net proceeds from the sale of our East Setauket, New York facility which was part of our Scientific Lasers business.\nOperating Cash Flows\nWe recorded a tax provision of $10.4 million in 2015, as compared to a tax benefit of $1.0 million in 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 22.6% of income before taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 5.6% of loss before taxes for 2014. Our effective tax\nRestructuring, Acquisition and Divestiture Related Costs\nIncome and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $18.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The estimated unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on this temporary difference is approximately $0.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet interest expense was $5.2 million in 2015 versus $5.1 million in the prior year. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.24% and 3.25% during 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $0.9 million and $1.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt.\n \u00b7 interest rate changes; \nacquisition, partially offset by $7.5 million of our contractual term loan payments and $31.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nThe cost and obligations of our U.K. Plan are calculated using many assumptions. Major assumptions used in the accounting for this pension plan include the discount rate, rate of inflation, mortality rate and expected return on plan assets. Assumptions are determined each year based on data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with a third-party actuary. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension cost and the unfunded benefit obligation at year end. The most sensitive assumption affecting the determination of our U.K. Plan pension obligation is the discount rate. A 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate as of December 31, 2015 would change the pension obligation by $3.3 million.\n \u00b7 underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; \nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. (the U.K. Plan\u201d). Our U.K. Plan was closed to new members in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, thereby limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees' years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the Guarantee\u201d) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities under the U.K. Plan (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) of GSI Group Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of GSI Group Inc.\n \u00b7 attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. \n \u00b7 changes in competition; \nThe specific components of our operating results for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are further discussed below.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The amounts include payments due with respect to both active operating facilities and idle facilities that have been vacated as a result of our restructuring actions. \nLaser Products segment revenue in 2014 increased by $11.1 million, or 6.7%, versus the prior year, due to growth across all product lines. The revenue growth was primarily due to an increase in revenue of our CO2 lasers and fiber lasers products, driven by new product launches, new customer wins, and market growth. In addition, revenue of our laser beam delivery products grew due to increased demand in material processing in advanced industrial markets and certain medical applications.\nForeign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net\nLaser Products segment revenue in 2015 decreased by $9.4 million, or 5.3%, versus the prior year, as a result of the JK Lasers divestiture, which reduced segment revenues by $16.7 million, partially offset by an increase in revenue of our laser beam delivery and CO2 laser products due to an increase in demand in the advanced industrial market and certain medical applications and the Lincoln Laser acquisition.\nLaser Products\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems and executive management.\n - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; \nRestructuring, acquisition and divestiture related charges primarily relate to our restructuring programs, acquisition related costs incurred for the acquisition of Skyetek in December 2015, Lincoln Laser in November 2015, Applimotion in February 2015, JADAK in March 2014 and NDS in January 2013. Acquisition related costs also include costs related to future potential acquisitions, failed acquisitions and changes in fair value of contingent considerations. Divestiture costs primarily related to the JK Lasers divestiture in April 2015.\nIn October 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan under which the Company may repurchase outstanding shares of the Company's common stock up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million. The shares may be repurchased from time to time, at the Company's discretion, based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company's common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be purchased when the Company would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The share repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the share repurchase program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to fund the share repurchase through cash on hand and future cash flow from operations. During 2015, the Company repurchased 122 thousand shares in the open market for an aggregate\nForeign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $1.3 million net gains in 2014 versus $1.3 million net losses for the prior year due to the performance of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen.\nAcquisition of Applimotion\nCash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $21.5 million during 2015, primarily due to $7.5 million of our contractual term loan payments, $23.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the repurchase of $1.6 million of the Company's common stock, offset by $13.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the Applimotion acquisition. Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $40.3 million during 2014, primarily due to $77.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to pay a portion of the cash consideration paid for the JADAK acquisition, partially offset by $7.5 million of our contractual term loan payments and $26.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $18.6 million during 2013, primarily due to $60.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to pay for the NDS\nLaser Products segment gross profit in 2015 decreased $0.6 million, or 0.8%, versus the prior year primarily due to a decline in revenue as a result of the JK Lasers divestiture, which decreased gross profit by $4.9 million, partially offset by revenue growth in our laser beam delivery and CO2 laser products and an increase in gross profit margin. Laser Products segment gross profit margin was 43.7% for 2015, compared with a gross profit margin of 41.8% for the prior year. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the JK Lasers divestiture, which accounted for 1.3 percentage point of the 1.9 percentage point increase. The remaining increase in gross profit margin was driven by increases in volume in our laser beam delivery and CO2 laser products, product mix, and continuous improvement productivity initiatives.\nSee Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had term loans of $27.5 million and revolving loans of $70.0 million outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nIn July 2014, we completed the sale of the Scientific Lasers business for $6.5 million in cash, net of working capital adjustments. We recorded a $1.7 million loss on the sale, net of tax, in the consolidated statement of operations.\nLaser Products operating income from continuing operations for 2015 increased by $2.9 million, or 8.8%, from 2014 primarily due to the improved profitability of the Laser Products segment after the JK Lasers divestiture, partially offset by an increase in restructuring and divestiture related costs of $1.7 million. Amortization of intangible assets for the Laser Products segment was $4.4 million in 2015 compared to $4.1 million in 2014.\n \u00b7 increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial technology applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, automation, metrology, and micromachining, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; \n (2) For the purpose of this calculation, current interest rates on floating rate obligation (LIBOR plus applicable margin, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) were used for the remainder contractual life of the term loan. \nDiscontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $7.3 million and $2.7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was primarily due to the sale of the Scientific Lasers business, which resulted in a $3.0 million fair value write-down of the Scientific Lasers business and an impairment charge of $0.5 million in connection with our joint venture investment in Excel Laser Technology Private Limited, which is part of our Scientific Lasers business.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nImpairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.\u201d We test our goodwill balances annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. Should the fair value of the Company's goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment loss may be necessary. In performing the test, we utilize the two-step approach which requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of our reporting units to the fair value of these reporting units. The Company's product lines generally correspond with its reporting units which is the level at which the Company evaluates its goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and compare it to the carrying value. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is primarily based on a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) method. The DCF approach requires that we forecast future cash flows for each of the reporting units and discount the cash flow streams based on a weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) that is derived, in part, from comparable companies within similar industries. The DCF calculations also include a terminal value calculation that is based upon an expected long-term growth rate for the applicable reporting unit. The carrying values of each reporting unit include assets and liabilities which relate to the reporting unit's operations. Additionally, reporting units that benefit from corporate assets or liabilities are allocated a portion of those corporate assets and liabilities on a proportional basis.\n \u00b7 improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: \nPrecision Motion\nAmended and Restated Credit Agreement\n \u00b7 broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; \nJK Lasers Divestiture\n (4) Purchase commitments represent unconditional purchase obligations as of December 31, 2015. \nLaser Products\nVision Technologies segment revenue in 2014 increased by $31.9 million, or 35.3%, versus the prior year. A $45.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the JADAK acquisition was partially offset by a decline in revenue in our visualization solutions products as a result of dual sourcing at an OEM customer that began in 2013, softness in medical equipment spending impacting our customer's demand for our products, and delays in new product introductions.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the years indicated:\nPrecision Motion segment gross profit for 2014 increased $0.6 million, or 2.0%, versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue volume of our optical encoders products. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 43.7% for 2014, compared with a gross profit margin of 46.3% for the prior year. The 2.6 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin was a consequence of manufacturing ramp-up costs.\n\nThe Laser Products, Vision Technologies, and Precision Motion segments have revenue transactions that are comprised of both single-element and multiple-element transactions. Multiple-element transactions typically include two or more products and occasionally contain non-standard/extended warranties, or preventative maintenance plans. For multiple-element transactions, revenue is generally recognized upon shipment, using the relative selling price method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605-25 Revenue - Multiple-Element Arrangements\u201d. Single-element transactions are typically recognized upon shipment at their contractually stated prices.\nThe most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2015, noting no impairment. With the exception of our NDS reporting unit, implied fair values of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 20%. As of December 31, 2015, there were no indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets.\nCash Flows\nStrategy\nOn February 19, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Applimotion Inc. ( Applimotion\u201d), a Loomis, California based provider of advanced precision motor and motion control technology to OEM customers in the medical and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of $14.0 million, net of working capital adjustments. This total purchase price includes $13.0 million in cash paid for the acquisition and $1.0 million in estimated fair value of future contingent considerations payable upon the achievement of certain revenue targets for the fiscal years 2015 to 2017. The undiscounted range of contingent considerations is zero to $4.0 million. Applimotion specializes in motor applications that require highly precise and dynamic motion control. The acquisition enhances our strategic position in precision motion control by enabling us to offer a broader range of motion control technologies and integrated solutions. Applimotion is included in the Company's Precision Motion reportable segment.\n\nForeign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were less than $0.1 million net losses in 2015 versus $1.3 million net gains for the prior year due to changes in the U.S. Dollar exchange rates against the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen and a $1.3 million foreign currency loss related to the cash proceeds in U.S. dollars from the JK Lasers divestiture being held for a period of time by our UK subsidiary.\nPrecision Motion operating income from continuing operations for 2014 increased by $1.0 million, or 8.0%, from 2013 primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $0.6 million and a $0.4 million decrease in restructuring costs.\nVision Technologies operating loss from continuing operations decreased by $41.0 million from an operating loss of $43.1 million in 2014 to an operating loss of $2.1 million in 2015 primarily due to the NDS goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge recorded in 2014 and a decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles of $4.8 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses as a result of the 2014 JADAK acquisition and an increase in restructuring charges related to our 2016 restructuring program.\nCash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was less than $0.1 million in 2015 as a result of the sale of our Scientific Lasers business in July 2014. Cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was $1.7 million and $7.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The $5.3 million decrease in cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations in 2014 from 2013 was primarily related to the divestiture of the Scientific Lasers business in 2014 and divestiture of the Semiconductor Systems business in 2013.\nPrecision Motion operating income from continuing operations for 2015 increased by $3.9 million, or 29.6%, from 2014 primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $8.4 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses due to the Applimotion acquisition and an increase in restructuring charges related to our 2016 restructuring program.\nDiluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) from continuing operations increased $1.51 from a loss per share of ($0.49) in 2014 to an earnings per share of $1.02 in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to operating income from continuing operations in 2015 versus operating loss from continuing operations in the prior year and higher other income resulting from the gain recognized from the JK Lasers divestiture.\n - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, diagnostic testing and life science research; \nWe have no material commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment and expect such expenditures to be approximately $6 million to $7 million in 2016.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nVision Technologies segment gross profit for 2014 increased $12.9 million, or 35.9%, versus the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the JADAK acquisition in March 2014, which accounted for an $18.9 million increase in gross profit year over year, partially offset by a decline in gross profit for our visualization solutions products due to lower revenue. Vision Technologies segment gross profit margin remained relatively flat year over year. Included in gross profit was amortization of developed technologies and amortization of inventory fair value step-ups of $3.7 million and $3.1 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on our consolidated balance sheet.\nR&D expenses were $29.0 million, or 7.9% of revenue, in 2014, versus $23.8 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in 2013. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to the acquisition of JADAK.\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest expense. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility provides an additional potential source of liquidity should it be required for business acquisitions. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nResults of Operations\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe gain on disposal of business in 2015 was due to a $19.6 million gain recognized as a result of the JK Lasers divestiture in April 2015.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $1.8 million during 2015 primarily due to cash consideration of $26.0 million paid for the Applimotion, Lincoln Laser and Skyetek acquisitions and $5.6 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $29.6 million in cash proceeds received from the sale of the JK Lasers business.\nOur funding policy is to fund pensions based on actuarial methods as permitted by regulatory authorities. The results of funding valuations depend on both the funding deficit and the assumptions that we make with regard to attributes such as asset returns, discount rates, mortality, retail price inflation and other market driven changes. The assumptions used represent one estimate of a possible future outcome. The final cost to us will be determined by events as they actually become known. Due to the underfunded positions that our U.K. Plan currently has and potential changes in the actual outcomes relative to our assumptions, we may have to increase payments to fund this plan in the future. As of December 31, 2015, the projected benefit obligation under the U.K. Plan exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $3.5 million.\nAs a result of the covenant that exists between our U.K. subsidiary and the Plan Trustees regarding the funding of the U.K. Plan, our ability to transfer assets outside our U.K. subsidiary, and its wholly owned subsidiary in China, may be limited.\nGSI Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Company\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, our\u201d) design, develop, manufacture and sell precision photonic and motion control components and subsystems to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM's) in the medical equipment and advanced industrial technology markets. Our highly engineered enabling technologies include laser sources, laser scanning and beam delivery products, optical data collection and machine vision technologies, medical visualization and informatics solutions, and precision motion control products. We specialize in collaborating with OEM customers to adapt our component and subsystem technologies to deliver highly differentiated performance in their applications.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the Company initiated a program targeting annualized savings of $4.5 million to $5.5 million after the program is fully executed. The 2016 restructuring program includes consolidating our manufacturing operations to optimize our facility footprint and to better utilize resources, and reducing redundant costs due to productivity cost savings and business volume reductions. The Company expects to incur cash charges of $4.5 million to $5.5 million related to this program, which we anticipate completing during the second quarter of 2016. The Company incurred costs related to the 2016 restructuring program amounting to $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, assessment of the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, employee benefit plans, restructuring charges, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for loss contingencies. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates in the future.\nRevenue\nOur strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nThe Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Laser Products and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision Technologies segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450 Contingencies\u201d, as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company's estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent the Company experiences warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims that differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting entry recorded to cost of revenue.\nResearch and development and engineering ( R&D\u201d) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects.\n \u00b7 changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; \n \u00b7 technological changes or developments; \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOn November 9, 2015, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of Lincoln Laser Company ( Lincoln Laser\u201d), a Phoenix, Arizona-based provider of ultrafast precision polygon scanners and other optical scanning solutions for the medical, food processing, and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of $12.6 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. This total purchase price includes $10.3 million in cash paid for the acquisition and $2.3 million in estimated fair value of future contingent consideration payable upon the achievement of certain revenue targets for fiscal year 2016. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to $6.0 million. Lincoln Laser specializes in ultrafast scanning, leveraging their expertise in polygon motor design and electro-optic subsystems. The acquisition creates an expanded range of highly competitive beam delivery technologies for the Company. The Lincoln Laser business is included in the Company's Laser Products reportable segment.\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2014 decreased by $1.5 million, or 7.1%, from 2013 primarily due to lower restructuring and acquisition costs. Restructuring and acquisition related costs were $1.5 million in 2014, compared to $2.2 million in 2013.\n\nOverview of Financial Results\nOn December 18, 2015, the Company acquired all assets and certain liabilities of Skyetek, Inc. ( Skyetek\u201d), a Denver, Colorado-based provider of embedded and standalone RFID Solutions for medical OEM's, for a total purchase price of $2.8 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. This total purchase price includes $2.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition and $0.2 million in estimated fair value of future contingent consideration payable upon the achievement of certain sales order commitment targets from October 2015 through June 2017. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to $0.3 million. Skyetek specializes in high-performing HF and UHF RFID technologies that maximize efficiency and visibility for OEM's serving the medical and advanced industrial markets. The acquisition creates an expanded range of highly competitive RFID solutions that significantly enhances our value proposition to OEM customers in various industries, but especially within the healthcare industry where there is an ever-growing need for improvements in workflow solutions, patient safety, anti-counterfeiting, and asset tracking throughout the hospital environment. The Skyetek business is included in the Company's Vision Technologies reportable segment.\nWe recognized $2.6 million, $2.7 million and $1.5 million of other income in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to earnings from our equity-method investment in Laser Quantum. Other income increased from 2013 to 2014 due to higher earnings from our equity-method investment in Laser Quantum and an increase in our ownership percentage from 25.1% to 41.2% during the second quarter of 2013.\n \u00b7 adverse judicial or legislative outcomes or political developments; \nLoss Contingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to labor, service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We expense legal fees as incurred.\nAs a significant portion of the NDS goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge was recognized in Canada, we had a $20.2 million loss before taxes in Canada in 2014 where we do not recognize any tax benefit as a result of the full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. This significantly reduced the income tax benefit as a percentage of the loss before taxes as reported in the consolidated statement of operations for 2014.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $93.5 million during 2014 primarily due to cash consideration of $93.7 million paid for the JADAK acquisition in March 2014 and $5.4 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds of $5.4 million from an escrow claim related to the NDS acquisition. This compares to cash used in investing activities of continuing operations of $85.3 million in 2013 primarily related to cash consideration of $80.8 million paid for the NDS acquisition and $4.8 million in capital expenditures.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nWe expect to use $8.5 million of cash in 2016 for financing activities, comprised of quarterly contractual payments of $1.9 million on our term loan facility, and $1.0 million in principal payments for our capital lease obligations. In addition, from time to time we may make payments to pay down our revolving credit facility with future cash flows generated from operating activities.\nOperating Income (Loss) by Segment\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOur defined benefit pension plan in Japan was terminated in the first quarter of 2015. The accrued retirement allowance amount calculated in accordance with Japanese retirement benefit rules on a voluntary retirement basis as of March 1, 2015 is being transferred to each employee's new defined contribution plan account over 4 years.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $10.3 million, or 2.8% of revenue, in 2014, versus $7.3 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2013. The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets from the JADAK acquisition.\nSignificant Events and Updates\nOperating income from continuing operations increased $45.7 million from an operating loss of $16.8 million in 2014 to operating income of $28.9 million in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an impairment charge of $41.4 million related to the NDS business in 2014 and an increase in gross profit in 2015.\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared service functions and other public company costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs.\nIn December 2012, we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d), consisting of a $50.0 million, 5-year term loan facility and a $75.0 million, 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2017. In February 2014, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $100 million from $75 million to $175 million and resets the accordion feature to $100 million for future expansion. Additionally, the Fourth Amendment increased the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio financial covenant from 2.75 to 3.00.\n\nThe following table sets forth operating income by segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nThe Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans, which are accounted for in accordance with provisions of ASC 605-20-25-3, Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts\u201d. Under this guidance, we recognize the separately priced extended/non-standard warranty and preventative maintenance fees ratably over the associated period.\nBased on the results of the most recent valuation completed in the fourth quarter 2015, the Company's annual contributions will be approximately $1.0 million per year in 2016 and will increase by 2.9% per year thereafter.\n\nR&D expenses were $31.0 million, or 8.3% of revenue, in 2015, versus $29.0 million, or 7.9% of revenue, in 2014. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by the JK Lasers divestiture.\nPension Plans. Our subsidiary located in the U.K. maintains a defined benefit pension plan (the U.K. Plan\u201d). The U.K. Plan was closed to new membership in 1997 and stopped accruing for additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees' years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. At December 31, 2015, the fair market value of the plan assets was $32.4 million, which was $3.5 million, or 9.9%, less than the projected benefit obligation of $35.9 million.\nThe Company recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $1.9 million in 2014, versus $5.4 million in 2013. The Company recognized acquisition related costs of $1.5 million in 2014, which included expenses of $0.6 million recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with the JADAK acquisition. The decrease in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs is primarily due to the decrease in costs related to restructuring programs in 2014 as compared to 2013. Acquisition related costs were $1.6 million during 2013.\nVision Technologies segment gross profit for 2015 increased $0.3 million, or 0.6%, versus the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to a decline in intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset by product mix. Vision Technologies segment gross profit margin was 39.3% for 2015, compared with a gross profit margin of 39.8% for the prior year. The 0.5 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to product mix, offset by lower intangible asset amortization expense. Included in gross profit for 2015 was amortization of developed technologies of $2.2 million. Included in gross profit for 2014 was amortization of developed technologies and amortization of inventory fair value step-ups of $3.7 million.\n - cross selling our entire product offerings to the leading medical equipment manufacturers; and \nWe regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our forecasted product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historical levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, which would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of revenue and higher income from operations than expected in that period.\nGross profit and gross profit margin can be influenced by a number of factors, including product mix, pricing, volume, manufacturing efficiencies and utilization, costs for raw materials and outsourced manufacturing, headcount, inventory obsolescence and warranty expenses.\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, $35.2 million of our $60.0 million cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States and Canada. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries. However, in certain instances, we have identified excess cash for which we may repatriate and have established liabilities for the expected tax cost. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries.\n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets is charged to our Laser Products, Vision Technologies and Precision Motion segments. Amortization of core technologies is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of customer relationships, trademarks, backlog and other intangibles are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.\nVision Technologies segment revenue in 2015 increased by $2.5 million, or 2.1%, versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to revenue from our optical data collection business being included in reported revenue in the prior year only following the JADAK acquisition in March 2014 and increases in revenue from our thermal printers and light and color measurement products,\nVision Technologies operating income from continuing operations decreased by $46.6 million from operating income of $3.6 million in 2013 to an operating loss of $43.1 million in 2014 primarily due to the NDS goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge of $41.4 million, an increase in amortization of intangibles and amortization of our inventory fair value step-ups of $3.7 million and a decline in visualization solutions revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating income from continuing operations as a result of the JADAK acquisition.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when we meet all four of the criteria for revenue recognition within the fiscal period. These criteria are: evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the price is fixed or determinable; and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue recognition requires judgment and estimates, which may affect the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any given period.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $44.0 million in 2014 versus $56.2 million in 2013. Cash provided operating activities of continuing operations decreased $12.2 million primarily due to net tax refunds of $11.8 million received in 2013 as a result of the settlement with the IRS. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was positively impacted by a decrease in our days sales outstanding from 56 at December 31, 2013 to 53 at December 31, 2014 and a decrease in inventories excluding inventories from the JADAK acquisition. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was negatively impacted by a decrease in our days payables outstanding from 48 at December 31, 2013 to 45 at December 31, 2014.\nSG&A expenses were $82.0 million, or 22.0% of revenue, in 2015, versus $84.4 million, or 23.1% of revenue, in 2014. SG&A expenses decreased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the JK Lasers divestiture and lower compensation expense, partially offset by increases from current year acquisitions and the JADAK acquisition in March 2014.\n\nintangible asset or other long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a fair value assessment is performed. For intangible assets, fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow forecasts. For other long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment), fair value estimates are derived from the sources most appropriate for the particular asset and have historically included such approaches as sales comparison approach and replacement cost approach. If fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. We also review the useful life and residual value assumptions for definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them.\nAcquisition of Lincoln Laser\nThe Company recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $8.3 million in 2015, versus $1.9 million in 2014. The Company recognized acquisition related costs of $1.3 million in 2015. Acquisition related costs included expenses of $1.9 million related to acquisitions in 2015, partially offset by a $0.6 million reversal of accruals for earn-out agreements in connection with the 2014 JADAK acquisition. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $5.8 million primarily related to our restructuring programs and $1.1 million in divestiture costs related to the JK Lasers divestiture. The increase in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs is primarily due to the increase in costs related to restructuring programs in 2015. Acquisition related costs were $1.5 million during 2014.\nPension Plans\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was less than $0.1 million and $7.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was primarily due to losses related to the Scientific Lasers business, which was sold in July 2014.\nThe organic growth in our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to growth in our Laser Products and Precision Motion segments offset by a decline in revenue in our Vision Technologies (formerly known as Medical Technologies) segment. The increase in revenue in our Laser Products segment was attributable to an increase in revenue from our laser beam delivery and CO2 lasers products. The growth in our Precision Motion segment was driven by an increase in revenue of optical encoders products, partially offset by a decline in revenue from our air bearing spindles products. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Vision Technologies segment related to our visualization solutions product line.\nLaser Products operating income from continuing operations for 2014 increased by $7.9 million, or 31.5%, from 2013 primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $5.4 million and a $2.0 million decrease in restructuring and acquisition related charges compared to 2013. Amortization of intangible assets for the Laser Products segment was $4.1 million in both 2014 and 2013.\n (5) Assumes funding obligations equivalent to $1.0 million per year, increasing 2.9% through 2021 based on annual funding contributions in effect as of December 31, 2015. Future funding requirements will be affected by various actuarial assumptions and actual experience of the pension plan. \nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult and subjective judgments.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d which delayed effective date of ASU 2014-09 to the first annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, however, no earlier than the original effective date of the first reporting period after December 15, 2016 under ASU 2014-09. Upon adoption, an entity may apply the new guidance either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or using modified retrospective approach which will result in the recording of the cumulative effect of applying the standard to customer contracts not yet completed as of the date of adoption in the beginning retained earnings balance at the date of the initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum allowed leverage ratio, and a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenant requirements as stated in the Fourth Amendment and our compliance therewith as of December 31, 2015.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. We cannot assure you that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary.\nFactors which may trigger an impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets include the following:\nInterest Income (Expense), Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), and Other Income (Expense), Net\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various other customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including: (i) limitations on certain payments; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or resolved, or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires. As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $5.5 million, of which $4.1 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2014, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $6.3, of which $4.1 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. Over the next twelve months, the Company may need to record up to $1.2 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in the event of statute of limitations closures.\nJudgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate outcome is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\nVision Technologies\n\nThrough December 31, 2015, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons.\nRestructuring Charges. In accounting for our restructuring activities, we follow the provisions of ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations\u201d. In accounting for these obligations, we make assumptions related to the amount of employee severance and benefits related costs, the time period over which facilities will remain vacant, sublease terms, sublease rates, and discount rates. Additionally, we make assumptions on the estimated remaining useful lives of assets being restructured and the residual value of the assets. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation has arisen. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate. Changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the amount previously expensed against our earnings and currently accrued on our consolidated balance sheet.\nThe following table sets forth the gross profit and gross profit margin for each of our reportable segments for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nAcquisition of Skyetek\nOur most significant identifiable intangible assets are customer relationships, acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names. In addition to our review of the carrying value of each asset, the useful life assumption for each asset, including the classification of certain intangible assets as indefinite lived,\u201d are reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized.\nThe following table sets forth external revenue by reportable segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nTotal revenue for 2015 was $373.6 million, an increase of $8.9 million, or 2.4%, versus the prior year primarily as the net result of our acquisitions and divestitures, which increased revenues by $10.0 million, or 2.8%. Foreign exchange rates adversely impacted our revenue by 4.0% during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in foreign exchange rates, total revenue for 2015 increased 3.6% versus the prior year. Our organic revenue growth is summarized as follows:\npartially offset by a decline in our visualization solutions revenue as a result of our radiology products and customer qualification cycles.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth interest income (expense), net, foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net and other income (expense), net for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nThe summarized financial information for Laser Quantum is as follows (in thousands):\nIncome Taxes\n \u00b7 significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and \nLaser Products\nThe following table sets forth operating expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nGross Profit\n \u00b7 broadening our portfolio of enabling technologies and capabilities through increased new product development investment, expanded sales and marketing channels to reach target customers and, investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; \nWe maintain a significant balance in our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The following table shows the breakdown of goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment by reportable segment as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nThe Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $41.4 million in the consolidated financial statements in 2014 as a result of lower expectations for revenue and operating profit from our NDS business.\nUnallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2015 increased by $2.1 million, or 10.4%, from 2014 primarily due to an increase in professional services costs and an increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $1.1 million. Restructuring and acquisition related costs were $2.6 million in 2015, compared to $1.5 million in 2014.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies is allocated first to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value. Any excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill. We make various assumptions and estimates in order to assign fair value to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. These assumptions typically include cash flow forecasts, discount rates, technology royalty rates, and customer attrition rates, among others. Actual cash flows may vary from forecasts used to value these assets at the time of the business combination.\nSignificant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, and market changes in general. See Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and Development and Engineering Expenses\n\n \u00b7 loss of key customers or personnel; \nSG&A expenses were $84.4 million, or 23.1% of revenue, in 2014, versus $76.3 million, or 24.1% of revenue, in 2013. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to the acquisition of JADAK.\nThe increase in net interest expense in 2014 versus the prior year was the result of higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates during 2014. The higher debt levels in 2014 were the result of borrowings to fund the JADAK acquisition in March 2014. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.25% and 2.83% during 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.0 million and $0.9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt.\nContractual Obligations\n\nLaser Products segment gross profit in 2014 increased $5.4 million, or 7.9%, versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue and an increase in gross profit margin. Laser Products segment gross profit margin was 41.8% for 2014, compared with a gross profit margin of 41.3% for the prior year. The 0.5 percentage point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to productivity improvements as a result of our manufacturing process improvement initiatives and margin improvements in our fiber lasers products.\nPrecision Motion segment revenue in 2014 increased by $4.8 million, or 7.9%, versus the prior year. This increase was principally driven by increased revenue of our optical encoders products as a result of a market share gain with a major OEM customer and new customer wins.\nThe Company, at the request of its customers, may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers. These services are usually in the form of time and materials based contracts which are short in duration. Revenue for time and materials services is recorded at the completion of services requested under a customer's purchase order.\nOn April 15, 2015, the Company completed the sale of our JK Lasers business for $29.6 million in cash, net of working capital adjustments and transaction costs, and recognized a $19.6 million pre-tax gain on the sale in the consolidated statement of operations. The JK Lasers business divestiture does not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n \u00b7 the decline of our market capitalization below net book value as of the end of any reporting period. \nDuring the first quarter of 2015, the Company implemented a program to eliminate redundant costs, as a result of acquisition and divestiture activities, to better align our operations to our strategic growth plans, to further integrate our business lines, and as a consequence of our productivity initiatives. The Company substantially completed the program in 2015, incurring costs amounting to $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We principally intend to reallocate resources and reinvest savings from the 2015 restructuring into higher growth businesses and lower cost regions.\n2016 Restructuring\n \u00b7 improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles and strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and \nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows and unused and available funds on our revolving credit facility for the years indicated (in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future years. We have excluded the future cash payments for unrecognized tax benefits of $6.1 million, including interest and penalties, because we are uncertain if and when such amounts may be settled. These unrecognized tax benefits have been classified as long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and have been further explained in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $1.0 million in 2014, as compared to a tax expense of $6.2 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 5.6% of loss before taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 38.3% of income before taxes for 2013. Our effective tax rate in 2014 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 27.0% primarily due to $4.6 million additional valuation allowance on net operating losses in Canada and certain other jurisdictions, which was partially offset by $1.1 million of international tax rate differences and a $1.7 million benefit associated with R&D tax credits generated during the year.\nWe assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. We also periodically reassess their continuing classification as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value.\npurchase price of $1.6 million at an average price of $13.29 per share. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 172 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.2 million at an average price of $12.48 per share.\nPrecision Motion",
