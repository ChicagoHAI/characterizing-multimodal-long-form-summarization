MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe have prepared this Management's Discussion and Analysis as an aid to understanding our financial results. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We begin with an introduction to our key businesses and then provide discussions of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and critical accounting policies. Our 2019, 2018 and 2017 fiscal years included 52 weeks.\nIntroduction\nOur Business\nWe are the leading global producer of reclining chairs and the second largest manufacturer/distributor of residential furniture in the United States. The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores retail network is the third largest retailer of single-branded furniture in the United States. We manufacture, market, import, export, distribute and retail upholstery furniture products under the La-Z-Boy\u00ae, England, Kincaid\u00ae, and Joybird\u00ae tradenames. In addition, we import, distribute and retail accessories and casegoods (wood) furniture products under the Kincaid\u00ae, American Drew\u00ae, Hammary\u00ae, and Joybird\u00ae tradenames. We have seven major manufacturing locations and six regional distribution centers in the United States and two facilities in Mexico to support our speed-to-market and customization strategy. We operate a wholesale sales office that is responsible for distribution of our product in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We also participate in two joint ventures in Thailand that support our international businesses: one that operates a manufacturing facility and another that operates a wholesale sales office. We operate a global trading company in Hong Kong which helps us manage our Asian supply chain by establishing and maintaining relationships with our Asian suppliers, as well as identifying efficiencies and savings opportunities. We also have contracts with several suppliers in Asia to produce products that support our pure import model for casegoods.\nWe sell our products to furniture retailers or distributors in the United States, Canada, and approximately 60 other countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand, directly to consumers through stores that we own and operate and through our websites, www.la-z-boy.com and www.joybird.com. The centerpiece of our retail distribution strategy is our network of 353 La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores and 550 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, each dedicated to marketing our La-Z-Boy branded products. We consider this dedicated space to be \"proprietary.\" We own 156 of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores. The remainder of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, as well as all 550 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, are independently owned and operated. La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores help consumers furnish their homes by combining the style, comfort, and quality of La-Z-Boy furniture with our available design services. La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations are defined spaces within larger independent retailers that are dedicated to displaying and selling La-Z-Boy branded products. In total, we have approximately 7.8 million square feet of proprietary floor space dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products in North America. We also have approximately 2.7 million square feet of floor space outside of the United States and Canada dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products. Our other brands, England, American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets, with approximately half of Hammary's sales originating through the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae store network. Kincaid and England have their own dedicated proprietary in-store programs with 590 outlets and approximately 1.9 million square feet of proprietary floor space. In total, our proprietary floor space includes approximately 12.4 million square feet worldwide. Joybird, which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, sells product almost exclusively online and has a limited amount of proprietary retail floor space it uses as a showroom to develop its brand.\nOur goal is to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term through executing our strategic initiatives. The foundation of our strategic initiatives is driving profitable sales growth in all areas of our business.\nWe drive growth in the following ways:\n\u2022 Our branded distribution channels, which include the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae store network and the La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, our store-within-a-store format. We expect this initiative to generate growth in our Retail segment through an increased company-owned store count and in our wholesale Upholstery segment as our proprietary distribution network expands. We are not only focused on growing the number of locations, but also on upgrading existing store locations to our new concept designs.\n\u2022 Our company-owned retail business. We are growing this business by increasing same-store sales through improved execution at the store level and by acquiring existing La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores and opening new La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, primarily in markets that can be serviced through our regional distribution centers, where we see opportunity for growth, or where we believe we have opportunities for further market penetration.\n\u2022 Our unique multi-channel distribution network. In addition to our branded distribution channels, over 2,100 other dealers sell La-Z-Boy products, providing us the benefit of multi-channel distribution. These outlets include some of the best-known names in the industry, including Art Van, Nebraska Furniture Mart, and Slumberland. Our other brands, England, American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid, enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets. We believe there is significant growth potential for our brands through these retail channels.\n\u2022 Our on-trend product including stationary upholstered furniture featured in our Live Life Comfortably\u00ae marketing campaign. While we are known for our iconic recliners, they account for less than half of our sales in dollars, and we believe we have the potential to expand sales of our other products. To stimulate growth, our Live Life Comfortably\u00ae marketing campaign features a celebrity brand ambassador, currently Kristen Bell, and focuses on expanding our digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities to build traffic across our multiple digital and physical properties. We are driving change throughout our digital platforms to improve the user experience, with a specific focus on the ease by which customers browse through our broad assortment, customize products to their liking, find stores to make a purchase, or purchase at www.la-z-boy.com.\n\u2022 Our innovative products, including stain-resistant iCleanTM fabrics and our power products, some of which include dual mechanisms and articulating headrests. Our recent innovation, duo\u00ae, is a revolutionary product line that features the look of stationary furniture with the power to recline at the push of a button. We are committed to innovation throughout our business, and to support these efforts we opened our new state-of-the-art Innovation Center in January 2019 at our Dayton, Tennessee campus.\n\u2022 Our multi-faceted online strategy to participate in and leverage the growth of online furniture sales. In July 2018 we purchased Joybird, a leading e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture, which positions us for growth in the ever-changing online selling environment and allows us to better reach millennial and Gen X consumers and leverage our supply chain assets. In addition, we continue to increase online sales of La-Z-Boy furniture through la-z-boy.com and other digital players, such as Wayfair and Amazon.\nOur reportable operating segments are the Upholstery segment, the Casegoods segment and the Retail segment.\n\u2022 Upholstery Segment. Our Upholstery reportable segment is our largest business segment and consists primarily of two operating segments: La-Z-Boy, our largest operating segment, and the\noperating segment for our England subsidiary. The Upholstery segment also includes our international wholesale businesses. We aggregate these operating segments into one reportable segment because they are economically similar and because they meet the other aggregation criteria for determining reportable segments. Our Upholstery segment manufactures and imports upholstered furniture such as recliners and motion furniture, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans and sleeper sofas. The Upholstery segment sells directly to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, operators of La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, major dealers, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers.\n\u2022 Casegoods Segment. Our Casegoods segment consists of one operating segment that sells furniture under three brands: American Drew\u00ae, Hammary\u00ae, and Kincaid\u00ae. The Casegoods segment is an importer, marketer, and distributor of casegoods (wood) furniture such as bedroom sets, dining room sets, entertainment centers and occasional pieces, and also manufactures some custom upholstered furniture. The Casegoods segment sells directly to major dealers, as well as La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers.\n\u2022 Retail Segment. Our Retail segment consists of one operating segment comprising our 156 company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores. The Retail segment primarily sells upholstered furniture, in addition to some casegoods and other accessories, to the end consumer through these stores.\n\u2022 Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other includes the shared costs for corporate functions, including human resources, information technology, finance and legal, in addition to revenue generated through royalty agreements with companies licensed to use the La-Z-Boy\u00ae brand name on various products. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with our other insignificant operating segments including our global trading company in Hong Kong and Joybird, an e-commerce retailer that manufactures and sells upholstered furniture such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, sleeper sofas and beds, and also imports and sells casegoods (wood) furniture such as occasional tables and other accessories. Joybird sells to end consumers almost exclusively online through its website, www.joybird.com. None of the operating segments included in Corporate & Other meet the requirements of reportable segments at this time.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2019, Fiscal Year 2018, and Fiscal Year 2017\nLa-Z-Boy Incorporated\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(Amounts in thousands, except percentages) </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/27/2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/28/2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>(FY19 vs FY18)\n% Change </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/29/2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>(FY18 vs FY17)\n% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,745,401 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,583,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,520,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>133,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3.0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales\nConsolidated sales increased $161.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $63.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 The increase in sales in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was driven by growth in both our core businesses and sales from our recent acquisitions. Sales in our Upholstery segment increased due to higher selling prices, favorable changes in our product mix, and higher tariff surcharges on Chinese imported parts. Sales in our Casegoods segment increased due to higher volume. In our Retail segment, sales increased due to our acquired stores and delivered same-store sales increases.\nConsolidated sales also benefitted from the acquisition of the Joybird ecommerce business reflected in Corporate & Other.\n\u2022 The increase in sales in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was driven by sales growth in all three of our operating segments. Our Upholstery segment benefited from the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland and a favorable change in our product mix. Our Casegoods segment grew sales volume by expanding floor space with existing retailers. Our Retail segment sales increased due to the addition of new stores that were not open in the prior-year period and from acquisitions we completed in fiscal 2018.\nOperating Margin\nOperating margin decreased 80 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year, following a decrease of 60 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\n\u2022 Gross margin increased 90 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Changes in our consolidated sales mix increased our gross margin 130 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year. This benefit was driven by the growth of our Retail segment and the acquisition of Joybird, which have a higher gross margin than our Upholstery and Casegoods reportable segments.\n\u2022 This was partly offset by lower gross margin in our Upholstery segment, primarily due to higher supply chain costs and changes in our product mix that were not fully offset by higher selling prices.\n\u2022 Additionally, fiscal 2019 includes purchase accounting charges related to our acquisitions that were 20 basis points higher in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Gross margin decreased 80 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 Our gross margin declined in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year, mostly due to a decline in our Upholstery segment's gross margin resulting from increased prices for our three core raw material components of steel, polyurethane foam and wood.\n\u2022 This was partly offset by a 20 basis point improvement in fiscal 2018 due to the growth of our Retail segment compared with the prior year, which has a higher gross margin than our wholesale segments.\n\u2022 Selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense as a percentage of sales increased 170 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 SG&A expense was 200 basis points higher in fiscal 2019 due to changes in our consolidated sales mix. This increase was driven by the growth of our Retail segment and the acquisition of Joybird, which have a higher level of SG&A expense as a percentage of sales than our Upholstery and Casegoods reportable segments.\n\u2022 Incentive compensation costs as a percentage of sales were 80 basis points higher during fiscal 2019 primarily due to our improved consolidated financial performance against our incentive-based targets during fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 Fiscal 2019 includes purchase accounting charges related to our acquisitions that were 20 basis points higher in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Partly offsetting these items was a benefit from favorable absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales dollars in fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 During the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we enacted changes to our employee vacation policies and reduced our salary vacation liability. This change provided a one-time 20 basis point benefit to SG&A expense.\n\u2022 SG&A expense was lower by 30 basis points in fiscal year 2019, due to a charge for a legal settlement in fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 40 basis points lower in fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense due to our consolidated financial performance being lower when compared against our incentive-based targets in fiscal 2018 than the prior year.\n\u2022 We benefited from favorable absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales dollars and a reduction in discretionary SG&A spending in fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Partially offsetting these items was a charge for a legal settlement of a civil dispute, which increased SG&A expense as a percentage of sales by 30 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. With the settlement, which resolved all of our past and future obligations at issue in the litigation, we recognized an additional charge of $4.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Additionally, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points in fiscal 2018, compared with the prior year, due to the growth of our Retail segment, which has a higher level of SG&A expense as a percentage of sales than our wholesale segments.\nWe explain these items further when we discuss each segment's results later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nUpholstery Segment\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(Amounts in thousands, except percentages) </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/27/2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/28/2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>(FY19 vs FY18)\n% Change </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/29/2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>(FY18 vs FY17)\n% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,268,242 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,227,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,191,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,906 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>148,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales\nOur Upholstery segment's sales increased $40.9 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $35.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 The fiscal 2019 sales increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022 Changes in our product mix drove a 1.9% increase in sales. Our product mix shifted to more power units which have a higher average selling price than units without power, and primarily resulted from increased sales of our duo\u00ae product.\n\u2022 Price increases in response to inflationary pressure on raw materials resulted in a 1.3% increase in sales, and higher tariff surcharges on Chinese imported parts increased sales by 1.2%.\n\u2022 These increases were somewhat offset by lower overall unit volume, which resulted in a 1.4% decrease in sales. Volume was flat to the prior year for the first three quarters and only started to decline around the beginning of our fourth quarter, which was in line with the rest of the furniture industry which saw negative growth in the first calendar quarter of 2019 for the first time since the 2008 recession.\n\u2022 The fiscal 2018 sales increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022 The acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland added sales of $18.9 million.\n\u2022 Changes in our product mix resulted in a 2.0% increase in sales. Our product mix shifted from non-powered fabric units to more leather units with power that have a higher average selling price.\n\u2022 Higher selling prices resulted in a 0.7% increase in sales. We raised our selling price in response to inflationary pressures on our raw materials.\n\u2022 These increases were somewhat offset by lower overall unit volume, which resulted in a 2.5% decrease in sales.\nOperating Margin\nOur Upholstery segment's operating margin decreased 50 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 190 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\n\u2022 Gross margin decreased 60 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 We experienced inflationary pressures in our supply chain which decreased the segment's gross margin by 90 basis points.\n\u2022 A shift in product mix resulted in a 70 basis point reduction in the segment's gross margin. The shift in our product mix to more units with power, especially our duo\u00ae product, drives higher gross profit dollars per unit but results in a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales than units without power.\n\u2022 Partially offsetting these items were selling price increases, which provided a 90 basis point benefit.\n\u2022 Raw material prices increased during the first half of the fiscal year, but then retracted in the back half of the year. For the full fiscal year 2019, changes in raw material prices were flat compared with the prior year.\n\u2022 Gross margin decreased 160 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 Increased prices, primarily for our three core raw material components of steel, polyurethane foam and wood, decreased the segment's gross margin by 80 basis points. The inflationary pressure we experienced from these raw materials was higher than we expected, and during fiscal 2018 we implemented sales price increases to offset the negative impact on our margins.\n\u2022 Lower absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities, driven primarily by a decline in production volume, decreased the segment's gross margin by 70 basis points.\n\u2022 The benefit of a legal settlement during fiscal 2017 negatively impacted the comparison of the segment's gross margin by 20 basis points.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was relatively flat during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 SG&A expense included a 30 basis point improvement due to a charge for a legal settlement recorded in fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 We benefited from favorable absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales dollars in fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 This was offset by 60 basis points of higher incentive compensation expense in fiscal 2019 due to the segment's improved financial performance against incentive-based targets in fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 A charge for a legal settlement of a civil dispute increased SG&A expense as a percentage of sales by 30 basis points. With the settlement, which resolved all of our past and future obligations at issue in the litigation, we recognized an additional charge of $4.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nCasegoods Segment\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(Amounts in thousands, except percentages) </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/27/2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/28/2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>(FY19 vs FY18)\n% Change </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/29/2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>(FY18 vs FY17)\n% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>114,473 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>111,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>100,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales\nOur Casegoods segment's sales increased $3.1 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $11.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 The sales increases in fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to higher volume we achieved through improved product styling, expanding our floor space with existing retailers, and a reliable in-stock position.\nOperating Margin\nOur Casegoods segment's operating margin increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year, following an increase of 190 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\n\u2022 Gross margin increased 30 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of 20 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019 and 2018, gross margin increased compared with each respective prior year due to increased volume and a shift in our product mix to newer, higher-margin collections. In fiscal 2018, this benefit was slightly offset by higher freight expense on imported product versus the prior year.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 170 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019, the decreased SG&A expense was primarily due to changes to our employee vacation policies, which provided a one-time benefit of 20 basis points.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2018, the decreased SG&A expense was due to improved absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales volume, and a reduction in discretionary spending.\nRetail Segment\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(Amounts in thousands, except percentages) </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/27/2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/28/2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>(FY19 vs FY18)\n% Change </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/29/2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>(FY18 vs FY17)\n% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>570,201 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>474,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>443,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales\nOur Retail segment's sales increased $95.6 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $31.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 The sales increase in fiscal 2019 included $67.0 million in sales from acquired stores. In fiscal 2019, delivered same-store sales increased $26.0 million or 5.7%, primarily driven by improved execution at the store level. The remainder of the change in sales during fiscal 2019 was due to the impact of new and closed stores.\n\u2022 The sales increase in fiscal 2018 was a result of $20.4 million from acquired stores and $14.7 million from new stores that were not open in the prior-year period. Partially offsetting these items was $3.7 million lower delivered same-store sales, a decline of 1.0%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower store traffic, the impact of which was somewhat offset by an increase in average ticket that resulted from increased design services and custom orders.\nOperating Margin\nOur Retail segment's operating margin increased 230 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year, following an increase of 10 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\n\u2022 Gross margin increased 30 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 20 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019, the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased design services and custom sales. Additionally, gross margin improved due to the benefit of acquired stores, which have gross margins that are slightly higher than our average store. These benefits more than offset the impact of purchase accounting charges resulting from the acquisitions during the year.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2018, gross margin decreased slightly due to higher promotional activity as we executed a variety of strategies to drive traffic to our stores and convert that traffic into sales.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 200 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 30 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased due to better leverage of fixed costs (primarily occupancy and administrative costs) on increased same-store delivered sales and the benefit of our acquired stores which operate with lower SG&A expense as a percentage of sales compared with our existing stores.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2018, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was lower than the prior year due to reducing our discretionary SG&A spending to better align with sales volume.\nCorporate and Other\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(Amounts in thousands, except percentages) </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/27/2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/28/2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>(FY19 vs FY18)\n% Change </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/29/2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>(FY18 vs FY17)\n% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate and Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>74,012 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>481.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Eliminations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(281,527 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(242,161 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (16.3 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(224,010 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate and Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48,743 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,330 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (46.2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(43,482 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales\nSales increased in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of Joybird, which contributed $59.1 million in sales. Sales in fiscal 2018 increased compared with the prior year due to an increase in intercompany commission revenue charged to our reportable segments by our global trading company in Hong Kong.\nEliminations increased in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 compared with each respective prior year due to higher sales from our Upholstery and Casegoods segments to our Retail segment, mainly because of the increased sales in the Retail segment and the impact of acquired stores.\nOperating Loss\nOur Corporate and Other operating loss was $15.4 million higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Incentive compensation costs were higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, primarily due to improved consolidated financial performance against incentive-based targets during fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 Fiscal 2019 includes the operating loss and purchase accounting adjustments related to the Joybird acquisition.\n\u2022 Additionally, in fiscal 2018, we recognized a $1.8 million insurance gain related to a fire in our England subsidiary's corporate office building.\nOur Corporate and Other operating loss was $10.2 million lower in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 The Corporate and Other operating loss was lower due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense because our consolidated financial performance was lower when compared against our incentive-based targets in fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 In addition, our global trading company in Hong Kong was more profitable, due to the increased intercompany commission revenue we charge to our reportable segments.\n\u2022 Lastly, we recorded a $1.8 million insurance gain during fiscal 2018 following a fire in our England subsidiary's corporate office building. We recognized a gain because the insurance proceeds exceeded the building's net book value on the date of the fire.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $1.0 million higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of $0.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher average short-term borrowings during the year. A short-term draw of $35 million on our credit line was taken in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and repaid by the end of fiscal 2019, and was used to help fund our acquisitions during the year. Additionally, fiscal 2019 included $0.6 million for fair value adjustments of future guaranteed payments related to the Joybird acquisition.\nPension Termination Charge\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we terminated our defined benefit pension plan for eligible factory hourly employees in our La-Z-Boy operating unit. In connection with the plan termination, we settled all future obligations under the plan through a combination of lump-sum payments to eligible participants who elected to receive them, and transferred any remaining benefit obligations under the plan to a highly rated insurance company. We recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of $32.7 million in our consolidated statement of income associated with the plan termination during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nOther Expense\nOther expense was $0.6 million higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 and $0.9 million lower in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017, due to a $2.2 million gain on investments recorded in fiscal\nwhen our available-for-sale convertible debt security converted to preferred shares of a privately-held company. Additionally, fiscal year 2018 had higher foreign currency exchange rate losses when compared to both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 26.4% for fiscal 2019, 36.7% for fiscal 2018, and 33.5% for fiscal 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted into law. Most of its provisions are effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Because we are a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer, the majority of the provisions, such as elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, new taxes on certain foreign-sourced income, and new limitations on certain business deductions began applying to us in fiscal 2019. As the Company is a fiscal year taxpayer, the lower corporate income tax rate of 21% was phased in, resulting in a blended federal rate of 30.4% for fiscal 2018. The federal rate is 21% for fiscal 2019.\nIn December of 2017, the SEC staff issued guidance which provides that companies that have not completed their accounting for the effects of the Tax Act but can determine a reasonable estimate of those effects should include a provisional amount based on their reasonable estimate in their financial statements. The guidance also allows companies to adjust the provisional amounts during a one-year measurement period which is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. In fiscal 2019, the Company finalized the provisional estimates of $0.2 million recorded in fiscal 2018, with no material change.\nImpacting our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was a net tax expense of $1.2 million primarily from the tax effect of the defined benefit pension plan termination of $2.6 million and a net tax benefit of $1.4 million primarily from excess tax benefits from shared-based payments. Absent discrete adjustments, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 would have been 25.1%.\nImpacting our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was a charge of $5.5 million, reflecting the net effect of the Tax Act. This included a $10.0 million charge for the provisional re-measurement of certain deferred taxes and related amounts, $0.2 million of income tax expense for the effects of the transition tax, and a benefit of $4.7 million primarily related to the lower blended federal tax rate. In addition to the above items related to the Tax Act, was a net tax benefit primarily of $2.4 million from research and development credits related to amended prior-year tax returns and the release of valuation allowances relating to certain U.S. state deferred tax assets and state income tax credits. Absent discrete adjustments, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 would have been 30.6%.\nImpacting our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was a net tax benefit of $1.4 million primarily from the release of valuation allowances relating to certain U.S. state deferred tax assets and state income tax credits. Absent discrete adjustments, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 would have been 34.6%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur sources of liquidity include cash and equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, cash from operations, and amounts available under our credit facility. We believe these sources remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, and fulfill other cash requirements for day-to-day operations, dividends to shareholders, and capital expenditures. We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $131.8 million at April 27, 2019, compared with $136.9 million at April 28, 2018. In addition, we had investments to enhance our returns on cash of $31.5 million at April 27, 2019, compared with $34.4 million at April 28, 2018.\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility secured primarily by all of our accounts receivable, inventory, and cash deposit and securities accounts. Availability under the agreement fluctuates according to a borrowing base calculated on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. We amended this agreement\non December 19, 2017, extending its maturity date to December 19, 2022. The credit agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants that apply under certain circumstances, including a fixed-charge coverage ratio requirement that applies when excess availability under the credit line is less than certain thresholds. At April 27, 2019, we were not subject to the fixed-charge coverage ratio requirement, had no borrowings outstanding under the agreement, and had excess availability of $148.1 million of the $150.0 million credit commitment.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2019 were $48.4 million compared with $36.3 million for fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures were higher in fiscal 2019, primarily due to construction of our new Innovation Center, upgrades to our upholstery manufacturing plant in Dayton, Tennessee, expansion of our England subsidiary plant, and construction of a new corporate office building for our England subsidiary. We have no material contractual commitments outstanding for future capital expenditures. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $50 to $60 million for fiscal 2020, reflecting plant upgrades to our upholstery manufacturing facilities in Dayton, Tennessee and Neosho, Missouri, as well as improvements to several of our retail stores.\nOur board of directors has sole authority to determine if and when we will declare future dividends and on what terms. We expect the board to continue declaring regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, but it may discontinue doing so at any time.\nWe believe our cash flows from operations, present cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of $131.8 million, short and long-term investments to enhance returns on cash of $31.5 million, and current excess availability under our credit facility of $148.1 million, will be sufficient to fund our business needs, including fiscal 2020 contractual obligations of $170.9 million as presented in our contractual obligations table. Included in our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at April 27, 2019, is $44.3 million held by foreign subsidiaries for which we have determined the amounts to be permanently reinvested.\nThe following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(Amounts in thousands) </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/27/2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/28/2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>(52 weeks)\n4/29/2017 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash Flows Provided By (Used For)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>150,745 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>115,750 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>147,990 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(122,567 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(55,224 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(65,230 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used for financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,787 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(76,255 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,414 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exchange rate changes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(475 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(5,084 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(13,988 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>29,524 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring fiscal 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $150.7 million. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income generated during fiscal 2019 as well as a $12.9 million increase in payroll and other compensation due to higher accrued incentive compensation costs that will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nDuring fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $115.8 million. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income generated during fiscal 2018 and a $6.6 million increase in accounts payable that is primarily due to standardizing payment terms with our vendors, which resulted in many payment terms being extended.\nDuring fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $148.0 million. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income generated during fiscal 2017 and a $12.5 million reduction in inventory. Our ability to improve our inventory efficiency and productivity more than offset an increase in finished goods inventory during fiscal 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring fiscal 2019, net cash used for investing activities was $122.6 million, primarily due to $76.5 million used for acquisitions and $48.4 million used for capital expenditures. Our cash used for acquisitions during the period included the acquisition of the assets of two independent operators of La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, one that operated nine stores and two warehouses in Arizona and one that operated one store in Massachusetts, as well as the acquisition of Joybird, an e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture. Our capital expenditures during the year primarily related to spending on manufacturing machinery and equipment, construction of our new Innovation Center, upgrades to our Dayton, Tennessee Upholstery manufacturing facility, expansion of our England subsidiary's plant and construction of their new corporate office building, and relocation of one of our regional distribution centers.\nDuring fiscal 2018, net cash used for investing activities was $55.2 million, which included $15.9 million to fund the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, $36.3 million for capital expenditures, and $5.9 million for net investment increases. Capital expenditures during the period primarily related to spending on the construction of our new Innovation Center, manufacturing machinery and equipment, and our continued ERP system implementation. Additionally, under the terms of the purchase agreement for the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, payment for the business was due 90 business days following the date of acquisition, and accordingly, we made that payment during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nDuring fiscal 2017, net cash used for investing activities was $65.2 million, which included $35.9 million for acquisitions of retail stores, $20.3 million for capital expenditures, and $9.8 million for net investment increases. Capital expenditures during the period primarily related to spending on manufacturing machinery and equipment, our continued ERP system implementation, and construction of our new Innovation Center.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2019, net cash used for financing activities was $32.8 million, including $23.0 million used to purchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase authorization and $23.5 million paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends. This was partly offset by $13.9 million in cash received upon exercise of employee stock awards, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nDuring fiscal 2018, net cash used for financing activities was $76.3 million, including $56.7 million used to purchase our common stock and $22.0 million paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends.\nDuring fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities was $53.4 million, including $36.0 million used to purchase our common stock and $20.7 million paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends.\nOur board of directors has authorized the purchase of company stock. As of April 27, 2019, 5.9 million shares remained available for purchase pursuant to this authorization. The authorization has no expiration date. We purchased 0.8 million shares during fiscal 2019 for a total of $23.0 million. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in purchasing company stock with the cash flows we anticipate generating in fiscal 2020.\nOther\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations of the types specified as of April 27, 2019:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due by Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(Amounts in thousands) </th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 - 3\nYears </th> <th> </th> <th>4 - 5\nYears </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>392,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,782 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent consideration\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future guaranteed payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>516,293 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>170,879 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>145,409 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>97,223 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>102,782 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* We have purchase order commitments of $87.3 million related to open purchase orders, primarily with foreign and domestic casegoods, leather and fabric suppliers, which are generally cancellable if production has not begun.\nOur consolidated balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2019 reflected a $1.0 million net liability for uncertain income tax positions. We do not expect that the net liability for uncertain income tax positions will significantly change within the next 12 months. We will either pay or release the liability for uncertain income tax positions as tax audits are completed or settled, statutes of limitation expire or other new information becomes available.\nWe do not expect our continuing compliance with existing federal, state and local statutes dealing with protection of the environment to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In some cases, these principles require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties and, as a result, such estimates and assumptions may significantly impact our financial results and disclosures. We base our estimates on currently known facts and circumstances, prior experience and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. We use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may, as warranted, use external advice. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions, and judgments and these differences could be significant. We make frequent comparisons throughout the year of actual experience to our assumptions to reduce the likelihood of significant adjustments. We record adjustments when differences are known. The following critical accounting policies affect our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Related Allowances\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate revenues primarily by manufacturing/importing and delivering upholstery and casegoods (wood) furniture products to independent furniture retailers, independently-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores or the end consumer. Each unit of furniture is a separate performance obligation, and we satisfy our performance obligation when control of our product is passed to our customer, which is the point in time that our customers are able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining economic benefit of the goods or services.\nThe majority of our wholesale shipping agreements are freight-on-board shipping point and risk of loss transfers to our customer once the product is out of our control. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for\nproduct shipments on third-party carriers at the point in time that our product is loaded onto the third-party container or truck and that container or truck leaves our facility. For our imported products, we recognize revenue at the point in time that legal ownership is transferred, which may not occur until after the goods have passed through U.S. Customs. In all cases, this revenue includes amounts we bill to customers for freight charges, because we have elected to treat shipping activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of our product as a fulfillment cost rather than an additional promised service. Because of this election, we recognize revenue for shipping when control of our product passes to our customer, and the shipping costs are accrued when the freight revenue is recognized. Revenue for product shipments on company-owned trucks is recognized for the product and freight at the point in time that our product is delivered to our customer's location.\nWe recognize revenue for retail sales and online sales to the end consumer through our company-owned retail stores, www.la-z-boy.com or www.joybird.com once the end consumer has taken control of the furniture, at which point legal title has passed to them. This takes place when the product is delivered to the end consumer's home. Home delivery is not a promised service to our customer, and is not a separate performance obligation, because home delivery is a fulfillment activity as the costs are incurred as part of transferring our product to the end consumer. At the time the end consumer places an order through our company-owned retail stores or www.la-z-boy.com, we collect a deposit on a portion of the total merchandise price. We record this as a customer deposit, which is included in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The balance of the order is paid in full prior to delivery of the product. Once the order is taken through our company-owned retail stores or www.la-z-boy.com we recognize a contract asset for the full order amount and a corresponding deferred revenue liability for the difference between the total order and the deposit collected. The contract asset is included in our other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet and the deferred revenue is included in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. At the time the end consumer places an order through www.joybird.com, we collect the entire amount owed and record this as a customer deposit. Because the entire amount owed is collected at the time of the order, there is no contract asset recorded for Joybird sales.\nAt the time we recognize revenue, we make provisions for estimated refunds, product returns, and warranties, as well as other incentives that we may offer to customers. When estimating our incentives we utilize either the expected value method or the most likely amount to determine the amount of variable consideration. We use either method depending on which method will provide the best estimate of the variable consideration, and we only include variable consideration when it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Incentives offered to customers include cash discounts, rebates, advertising agreements and other sales incentive programs. Our sales incentives, including cash discounts and rebates, are recorded as a reduction to revenues. Service allowances are for a distinct good or service received from our customer and are recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income, and are not recorded as a reduction of revenue and are not considered variable consideration. We use substantial judgment based on the type of variable consideration or service allowance, historical experience and expected sales volume when estimating these provisions. Sales, value added, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The expected costs associated with our warranties and service allowances are recognized as expense when our products are sold.\nAll orders are fulfilled within one year of order date, therefore we do not have any unfulfilled performance obligations. Additionally, we elected the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component because at contract inception we expect the period between when we transfer our product to our customer and when the customer pays for the product to be one year or less.\nTrade accounts receivable arise from the sale of products on trade credit terms. On a quarterly basis, we review all significant accounts as to their past due balances, as well as collectability of the outstanding trade accounts receivable for possible write off. It is our policy to write off the accounts receivable against the allowance account when we deem the receivable to be uncollectible. Additionally, we review orders from dealers that are significantly past due, and we ship product only when our ability to collect payment from our customer for the new order is probable.\nOur allowances for credit losses reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the trade accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historic experience, and other currently available evidence.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset or asset group. Using either quoted market prices or an analysis of undiscounted projected future cash flows by asset groups, we determine whether there is any indicator of impairment requiring us to further assess the fair value of our long-lived assets. Our asset groups consist of our operating segments in our Upholstery reportable segment, our Casegoods segment, each of our retail stores, our Joybird\u00ae business and other corporate assets.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nWe test intangibles and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets include our American Drew trade name, and the reacquired right to own and operate La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores we have acquired. We have amortizable intangible assets related to the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, which are primarily comprised of acquired customer relationships. We also have an amortizable trade name related to the Joybird\u00ae acquisition. We establish the fair value of our trade names and reacquired rights based upon the relief from royalty method. We establish the fair value of our other amortizable intangible assets based on the multi-period excess earnings method, a variant of the income approach, and also using the relief from royalty method.\nOur goodwill relates to the acquisition of La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores and the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the acquisition of Joybird\u00ae, an e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture. The reporting unit for goodwill arising from retail store acquisitions is our Retail operating segment. The reporting unit for goodwill arising from the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland and the acquisition of Joybird is those respective businesses. We establish the fair value for the reporting unit based on the discounted cash flows to determine if the fair value of our goodwill exceeds its carrying value.\nOther Loss Reserves\nWe have various other loss exposures arising from the ordinary course of business, including inventory obsolescence, health insurance, litigation, environmental claims, insured and self-insured workers' compensation, restructuring charges, and product liabilities. Establishing loss reserves requires us to use estimates and management's judgment with respect to risk and ultimate liability. We use legal counsel or other experts, including actuaries as appropriate, to assist us in developing estimates. Due to the uncertainties and potential changes in facts and circumstances, additional charges related to these reserves could be required in the future.\nWe have various excess loss coverages for health insurance, auto, product liability and workers' compensation liabilities. Our deductibles generally do not exceed $1.5 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. When we record deferred tax assets, we are required to estimate, based on forecasts of taxable earnings in the relevant tax jurisdiction, whether we are more likely than not to recover on them. In making judgments about realizing the value of our deferred tax assets, we consider historic and projected future operating results, the eligible carry-forward period, tax law changes and other relevant considerations.\nProduct Warranties\nWe account for product warranties by accruing an estimated liability when we recognize revenue on the sale of warranted product. We estimate future warranty claims based on claim experience and any additional anticipated future costs on previously sold product. We incorporate repair costs in our liability estimates, including materials, labor, and overhead amounts necessary to perform repairs, and any costs associated with delivering repaired product to our customers and consumers. We use considerable judgment in making our estimates. We record differences between our estimated and actual costs when the differences are known.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation cost for equity-based awards on the grant date based on the awards' fair value, and recognize expense over the vesting period. We measure stock-based compensation cost for liability-based awards on the grant date based on the awards' fair value, and recognize expense over the vesting period. We remeasure the liability for these awards and adjust their fair value at the end of each reporting period until paid. We recognize compensation cost for stock-based awards that vest based on performance conditions ratably over the vesting periods when the vesting of such awards becomes probable. Determining the probability of award vesting requires judgment, including assumptions about future operating performance. While the assumptions we use to calculate and account for stock-based compensation awards represent management's best estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our management's best judgment. As a result, if we revise our assumptions and estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nWe estimate the fair value of each option grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We estimate expected volatility based on the historic volatility of our common shares. We estimate the average expected life using the contractual term of the stock option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination trends. We base the risk-free rate on U.S. Treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We estimate forfeitures at the date of grant based on historic experience.\nWe estimate the fair value of each performance award grant that vests based on a market condition using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The Monte Carlo model incorporates more complex variables than closed-form models such as the Black-Scholes option valuation model used for option grants. The Monte Carlo valuation model simulates a distribution of stock prices to yield an expected distribution of stock prices over the remaining performance period. The stock-paths are simulated using volatilities calculated with historical information using data from a look-back period that is equal to the vesting period. The model assumes a zero-coupon, risk-free interest rate with a term equal to the vesting period. The simulations are repeated many times and the mean of the discounted values is calculated\nas the grant date fair value for the award. The final payout of the award as calculated by the model is then discounted back to the grant date using the risk-free interest rate.\nBoth the Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes methodologies are based, in part, on inputs for which there are little or no observable market data, requiring us to develop our own assumptions. Inherent in both of these models are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards and other new accounting standards.", "item_7_truncated": "We believe our cash flows from operations, present cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of $131.8 million, short and long-term investments to enhance returns on cash of $31.5 million, and current excess availability under our credit facility of $148.1 million, will be sufficient to fund our business needs, including fiscal 2020 contractual obligations of $170.9 million as presented in our contractual obligations table. Included in our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at April 27, 2019, is $44.3 million held by foreign subsidiaries for which we have determined the amounts to be permanently reinvested.\nAt the time we recognize revenue, we make provisions for estimated refunds, product returns, and warranties, as well as other incentives that we may offer to customers. When estimating our incentives we utilize either the expected value method or the most likely amount to determine the amount of variable consideration. We use either method depending on which method will provide the best estimate of the variable consideration, and we only include variable consideration when it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Incentives offered to customers include cash discounts, rebates, advertising agreements and other sales incentive programs. Our sales incentives, including cash discounts and rebates, are recorded as a reduction to revenues. Service allowances are for a distinct good or service received from our customer and are recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income, and are not recorded as a reduction of revenue and are not considered variable consideration. We use substantial judgment based on the type of variable consideration or service allowance, historical experience and expected sales volume when estimating these provisions. Sales, value added, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The expected costs associated with our warranties and service allowances are recognized as expense when our products are sold.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due by Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(Amounts in thousands) </th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 -

Additionally, gross margin improved due to the benefit of acquired stores, which have gross margins that are slightly higher than our average store. These benefits more than offset the impact of purchase accounting charges resulting from the acquisitions during the year.\nproduct shipments on third-party carriers at the point in time that our product is loaded onto the third-party container or truck and that container or truck leaves our facility. For our imported products, we recognize revenue at the point in time that legal ownership is transferred, which may not occur until after the goods have passed through U.S. Customs. In all cases, this revenue includes amounts we bill to customers for freight charges, because we have elected to treat shipping activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of our product as a fulfillment cost rather than an additional promised service. Because of this election, we recognize revenue for shipping when control of our product passes to our customer, and the shipping costs are accrued when the freight revenue is recognized. Revenue for product shipments on company-owned trucks is recognized for the product and freight at the point in time that our product is delivered to our customer's location.\nThe following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows:\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 200 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 30 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nOur Corporate and Other operating loss was $15.4 million higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2018, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was lower than the prior year due to reducing our discretionary SG&A spending to better align with sales volume.\nDuring fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $115.8 million. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income generated during fiscal 2018 and a $6.6 million increase in accounts payable that is primarily due to standardizing payment terms with our vendors, which resulted in many payment terms being extended.\nOperating Activities\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019 and 2018, gross margin increased compared with each respective prior year due to increased volume and a shift in our product mix to newer, higher-margin collections. In fiscal 2018, this benefit was slightly offset by higher freight expense on imported product versus the prior year.\nOur goodwill relates to the acquisition of La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores and the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the acquisition of Joybird\u00ae, an e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture. The reporting unit for goodwill arising from retail store acquisitions is our Retail operating segment. The reporting unit for goodwill arising from the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland and the acquisition of Joybird is those respective businesses. We establish the fair value for the reporting unit based on the discounted cash flows to determine if the fair value of our goodwill exceeds its carrying value.\n\u2022 Partially offsetting these items were selling price increases, which provided a 90 basis point benefit.\nUpholstery Segment\nWe sell our products to furniture retailers or distributors in the United States, Canada, and approximately 60 other countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand, directly to consumers through stores that we own and operate and through our websites, www.la-z-boy.com and www.joybird.com. The centerpiece of our retail distribution strategy is our network of 353 La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores and 550 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, each dedicated to marketing our La-Z-Boy branded products. We consider this dedicated space to be \"proprietary.\" We own 156 of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores. The remainder of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, as well as all 550 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, are independently owned and operated. La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores help consumers furnish their homes by combining the style, comfort, and quality of La-Z-Boy furniture with our available design services. La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations are defined spaces within larger independent retailers that are dedicated to displaying and selling La-Z-Boy branded products. In total, we have approximately 7.8 million square feet of proprietary floor space dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products in North America. We also have approximately 2.7 million square feet of floor space outside of the United States and Canada dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products. Our other brands, England, American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets, with approximately half of Hammary's sales originating through the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae store network. Kincaid and England have their own dedicated proprietary in-store programs with 590 outlets and approximately 1.9 million square feet of proprietary floor space. In total, our proprietary floor space includes approximately 12.4 million square feet worldwide. Joybird, which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, sells product almost exclusively online and has a limited amount of proprietary retail floor space it uses as a showroom to develop its brand.\n\u2022 The increase in sales in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was driven by sales growth in all three of our operating segments. Our Upholstery segment benefited from the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland and a favorable change in our product mix. Our Casegoods segment grew sales volume by expanding floor space with existing retailers. Our Retail segment sales increased due to the addition of new stores that were not open in the prior-year period and from acquisitions we completed in fiscal 2018.\nCorporate and Other\n\u2022 Incentive compensation costs as a percentage of sales were 80 basis points higher during fiscal 2019 primarily due to our improved consolidated financial performance against our incentive-based targets during fiscal 2019.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOperating Loss\nOther\nOperating Margin\nLa-Z-Boy Incorporated\n\nOur Casegoods segment's sales increased $3.1 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $11.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In some cases, these principles require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties and, as a result, such estimates and assumptions may significantly impact our financial results and disclosures. We base our estimates on currently known facts and circumstances, prior experience and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. We use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may, as warranted, use external advice. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions, and judgments and these differences could be significant. We make frequent comparisons throughout the year of actual experience to our assumptions to reduce the likelihood of significant adjustments. We record adjustments when differences are known. The following critical accounting policies affect our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Margin\nWe drive growth in the following ways:\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019, the decreased SG&A expense was primarily due to changes to our employee vacation policies, which provided a one-time benefit of 20 basis points.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2018, the decreased SG&A expense was due to improved absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales volume, and a reduction in discretionary spending.\nOur allowances for credit losses reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the trade accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historic experience, and other currently available evidence.\nOur Business\nOur Upholstery segment's sales increased $40.9 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $35.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 We benefited from favorable absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales dollars and a reduction in discretionary SG&A spending in fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense as a percentage of sales increased 170 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\nImpacting our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was a net tax expense of $1.2 million primarily from the tax effect of the defined benefit pension plan termination of $2.6 million and a net tax benefit of $1.4 million primarily from excess tax benefits from shared-based payments. Absent discrete adjustments, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 would have been 25.1%.\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate revenues primarily by manufacturing/importing and delivering upholstery and casegoods (wood) furniture products to independent furniture retailers, independently-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores or the end consumer. Each unit of furniture is a separate performance obligation, and we satisfy our performance obligation when control of our product is passed to our customer, which is the point in time that our customers are able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining economic benefit of the goods or services.\n\u2022 Retail Segment. Our Retail segment consists of one operating segment comprising our 156 company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores. The Retail segment primarily sells upholstered furniture, in addition to some casegoods and other accessories, to the end consumer through these stores.\nIntroduction\n\non December 19, 2017, extending its maturity date to December 19, 2022. The credit agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants that apply under certain circumstances, including a fixed-charge coverage ratio requirement that applies when excess availability under the credit line is less than certain thresholds. At April 27, 2019, we were not subject to the fixed-charge coverage ratio requirement, had no borrowings outstanding under the agreement, and had excess availability of $148.1 million of the $150.0 million credit commitment.\nWe have various excess loss coverages for health insurance, auto, product liability and workers' compensation liabilities. Our deductibles generally do not exceed $1.5 million.\n\u2022 Lastly, we recorded a $1.8 million insurance gain during fiscal 2018 following a fire in our England subsidiary's corporate office building. We recognized a gain because the insurance proceeds exceeded the building's net book value on the date of the fire.\nWe have prepared this Management's Discussion and Analysis as an aid to understanding our financial results. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We begin with an introduction to our key businesses and then provide discussions of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and critical accounting policies. Our 2019, 2018 and 2017 fiscal years included 52 weeks.\n\u2022 Gross margin increased 30 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of 20 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nOur Upholstery segment's operating margin decreased 50 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 190 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\n\u2022 Gross margin increased 90 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\nSales\n\u2022 The fiscal 2019 sales increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022 These increases were somewhat offset by lower overall unit volume, which resulted in a 2.5% decrease in sales.\n\u2022 The acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland added sales of $18.9 million.\nEliminations increased in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 compared with each respective prior year due to higher sales from our Upholstery and Casegoods segments to our Retail segment, mainly because of the increased sales in the Retail segment and the impact of acquired stores.\n\u2022 Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other includes the shared costs for corporate functions, including human resources, information technology, finance and legal, in addition to revenue generated through royalty agreements with companies licensed to use the La-Z-Boy\u00ae brand name on various products. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with our other insignificant operating segments including our global trading company in Hong Kong and Joybird, an e-commerce retailer that manufactures and sells upholstered furniture such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, sleeper sofas and beds, and also imports and sells casegoods (wood) furniture such as occasional tables and other accessories. Joybird sells to end consumers almost exclusively online through its website, www.joybird.com. None of the operating segments included in Corporate & Other meet the requirements of reportable segments at this time.\nOperating margin decreased 80 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year, following a decrease of 60 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\n\u2022 SG&A expense was lower by 30 basis points in fiscal year 2019, due to a charge for a legal settlement in fiscal 2018.\nOther Expense\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. When we record deferred tax assets, we are required to estimate, based on forecasts of taxable earnings in the relevant tax jurisdiction, whether we are more likely than not to recover on them. In making judgments about realizing the value of our deferred tax assets, we consider historic and projected future operating results, the eligible carry-forward period, tax law changes and other relevant considerations.\n\u2022 The Corporate and Other operating loss was lower due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense because our consolidated financial performance was lower when compared against our incentive-based targets in fiscal 2018.\nConsolidated sales increased $161.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $63.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility secured primarily by all of our accounts receivable, inventory, and cash deposit and securities accounts. Availability under the agreement fluctuates according to a borrowing base calculated on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. We amended this agreement\nWe explain these items further when we discuss each segment's results later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nDuring fiscal 2018, net cash used for financing activities was $76.3 million, including $56.7 million used to purchase our common stock and $22.0 million paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2018, gross margin decreased slightly due to higher promotional activity as we executed a variety of strategies to drive traffic to our stores and convert that traffic into sales.\nwhen our available-for-sale convertible debt security converted to preferred shares of a privately-held company. Additionally, fiscal year 2018 had higher foreign currency exchange rate losses when compared to both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 Our innovative products, including stain-resistant iCleanTM fabrics and our power products, some of which include dual mechanisms and articulating headrests. Our recent innovation, duo\u00ae, is a revolutionary product line that features the look of stationary furniture with the power to recline at the push of a button. We are committed to innovation throughout our business, and to support these efforts we opened our new state-of-the-art Innovation Center in January 2019 at our Dayton, Tennessee campus.\nWe test intangibles and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets include our American Drew trade name, and the reacquired right to own and operate La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores we have acquired. We have amortizable intangible assets related to the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, which are primarily comprised of acquired customer relationships. We also have an amortizable trade name related to the Joybird\u00ae acquisition. We establish the fair value of our trade names and reacquired rights based upon the relief from royalty method. We establish the fair value of our other amortizable intangible assets based on the multi-period excess earnings method, a variant of the income approach, and also using the relief from royalty method.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted into law. Most of its provisions are effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Because we are a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer, the majority of the provisions, such as elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, new taxes on certain foreign-sourced income, and new limitations on certain business deductions began applying to us in fiscal 2019. As the Company is a fiscal year taxpayer, the lower corporate income tax rate of 21% was phased in, resulting in a blended federal rate of 30.4% for fiscal 2018. The federal rate is 21% for fiscal 2019.\nAll orders are fulfilled within one year of order date, therefore we do not have any unfulfilled performance obligations. Additionally, we elected the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component because at contract inception we expect the period between when we transfer our product to our customer and when the customer pays for the product to be one year or less.\n\n\u2022 Gross margin decreased 60 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Gross margin decreased 80 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 We experienced inflationary pressures in our supply chain which decreased the segment's gross margin by 90 basis points.\nInvesting Activities\nWe estimate the fair value of each performance award grant that vests based on a market condition using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The Monte Carlo model incorporates more complex variables than closed-form models such as the Black-Scholes option valuation model used for option grants. The Monte Carlo valuation model simulates a distribution of stock prices to yield an expected distribution of stock prices over the remaining performance period. The stock-paths are simulated using volatilities calculated with historical information using data from a look-back period that is equal to the vesting period. The model assumes a zero-coupon, risk-free interest rate with a term equal to the vesting period. The simulations are repeated many times and the mean of the discounted values is calculated\nOur Retail segment's sales increased $95.6 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $31.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nImpacting our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was a charge of $5.5 million, reflecting the net effect of the Tax Act. This included a $10.0 million charge for the provisional re-measurement of certain deferred taxes and related amounts, $0.2 million of income tax expense for the effects of the transition tax, and a benefit of $4.7 million primarily related to the lower blended federal tax rate. In addition to the above items related to the Tax Act, was a net tax benefit primarily of $2.4 million from research and development credits related to amended prior-year tax returns and the release of valuation allowances relating to certain U.S. state deferred tax assets and state income tax credits. Absent discrete adjustments, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 would have been 30.6%.\n\u2022 Increased prices, primarily for our three core raw material components of steel, polyurethane foam and wood, decreased the segment's gross margin by 80 basis points. The inflationary pressure we experienced from these raw materials was higher than we expected, and during fiscal 2018 we implemented sales price increases to offset the negative impact on our margins.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\u2022 The sales increase in fiscal 2018 was a result of $20.4 million from acquired stores and $14.7 million from new stores that were not open in the prior-year period. Partially offsetting these items was $3.7 million lower delivered same-store sales, a decline of 1.0%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower store traffic, the impact of which was somewhat offset by an increase in average ticket that resulted from increased design services and custom orders.\noperating segment for our England subsidiary. The Upholstery segment also includes our international wholesale businesses. We aggregate these operating segments into one reportable segment because they are economically similar and because they meet the other aggregation criteria for determining reportable segments. Our Upholstery segment manufactures and imports upholstered furniture such as recliners and motion furniture, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans and sleeper sofas. The Upholstery segment sells directly to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, operators of La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, major dealers, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers.\n\n\u2022 Our unique multi-channel distribution network. In addition to our branded distribution channels, over 2,100 other dealers sell La-Z-Boy products, providing us the benefit of multi-channel distribution. These outlets include some of the best-known names in the industry, including Art Van, Nebraska Furniture Mart, and Slumberland. Our other brands, England, American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid, enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets. We believe there is significant growth potential for our brands through these retail channels.\nInterest Expense\n\u2022 Casegoods Segment. Our Casegoods segment consists of one operating segment that sells furniture under three brands: American Drew\u00ae, Hammary\u00ae, and Kincaid\u00ae. The Casegoods segment is an importer, marketer, and distributor of casegoods (wood) furniture such as bedroom sets, dining room sets, entertainment centers and occasional pieces, and also manufactures some custom upholstered furniture. The Casegoods segment sells directly to major dealers, as well as La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers.\nProduct Warranties\n\u2022 Partly offsetting these items was a benefit from favorable absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales dollars in fiscal 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nSales\nOur sources of liquidity include cash and equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, cash from operations, and amounts available under our credit facility. We believe these sources remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, and fulfill other cash requirements for day-to-day operations, dividends to shareholders, and capital expenditures. We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $131.8 million at April 27, 2019, compared with $136.9 million at April 28, 2018. In addition, we had investments to enhance our returns on cash of $31.5 million at April 27, 2019, compared with $34.4 million at April 28, 2018.\nOur Casegoods segment's operating margin increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year, following an increase of 190 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\nOur board of directors has authorized the purchase of company stock. As of April 27, 2019, 5.9 million shares remained available for purchase pursuant to this authorization. The authorization has no expiration date. We purchased 0.8 million shares during fiscal 2019 for a total of $23.0 million. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in purchasing company stock with the cash flows we anticipate generating in fiscal 2020.\n\u2022 The increase in sales in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was driven by growth in both our core businesses and sales from our recent acquisitions. Sales in our Upholstery segment increased due to higher selling prices, favorable changes in our product mix, and higher tariff surcharges on Chinese imported parts. Sales in our Casegoods segment increased due to higher volume. In our Retail segment, sales increased due to our acquired stores and delivered same-store sales increases.\nDuring fiscal 2017, net cash used for investing activities was $65.2 million, which included $35.9 million for acquisitions of retail stores, $20.3 million for capital expenditures, and $9.8 million for net investment increases. Capital expenditures during the period primarily related to spending on manufacturing machinery and equipment, our continued ERP system implementation, and construction of our new Innovation Center.\n\u2022 Our on-trend product including stationary upholstered furniture featured in our Live Life Comfortably\u00ae marketing campaign. While we are known for our iconic recliners, they account for less than half of our sales in dollars, and we believe we have the potential to expand sales of our other products. To stimulate growth, our Live Life Comfortably\u00ae marketing campaign features a celebrity brand ambassador, currently Kristen Bell, and focuses on expanding our digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities to build traffic across our multiple digital and physical properties. We are driving change throughout our digital platforms to improve the user experience, with a specific focus on the ease by which customers browse through our broad assortment, customize products to their liking, find stores to make a purchase, or purchase at www.la-z-boy.com.\nOperating Margin\n\u2022 The benefit of a legal settlement during fiscal 2017 negatively impacted the comparison of the segment's gross margin by 20 basis points.\nOur goal is to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term through executing our strategic initiatives. The foundation of our strategic initiatives is driving profitable sales growth in all areas of our business.\n* We have purchase order commitments of $87.3 million related to open purchase orders, primarily with foreign and domestic casegoods, leather and fabric suppliers, which are generally cancellable if production has not begun.\n\u2022 Gross margin decreased 160 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nWe do not expect our continuing compliance with existing federal, state and local statutes dealing with protection of the environment to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or liquidity.\n\u2022 Fiscal 2019 includes the operating loss and purchase accounting adjustments related to the Joybird acquisition.\n\u2022 This was partly offset by a 20 basis point improvement in fiscal 2018 due to the growth of our Retail segment compared with the prior year, which has a higher gross margin than our wholesale segments.\n\u2022 Higher selling prices resulted in a 0.7% increase in sales. We raised our selling price in response to inflationary pressures on our raw materials.\n\u2022 The fiscal 2018 sales increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022 Price increases in response to inflationary pressure on raw materials resulted in a 1.3% increase in sales, and higher tariff surcharges on Chinese imported parts increased sales by 1.2%.\nSales increased in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of Joybird, which contributed $59.1 million in sales. Sales in fiscal 2018 increased compared with the prior year due to an increase in intercompany commission revenue charged to our reportable segments by our global trading company in Hong Kong.\n\u2022 Incentive compensation costs were higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, primarily due to improved consolidated financial performance against incentive-based targets during fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 Additionally, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points in fiscal 2018, compared with the prior year, due to the growth of our Retail segment, which has a higher level of SG&A expense as a percentage of sales than our wholesale segments.\nWe measure stock-based compensation cost for equity-based awards on the grant date based on the awards' fair value, and recognize expense over the vesting period. We measure stock-based compensation cost for liability-based awards on the grant date based on the awards' fair value, and recognize expense over the vesting period. We remeasure the liability for these awards and adjust their fair value at the end of each reporting period until paid. We recognize compensation cost for stock-based awards that vest based on performance conditions ratably over the vesting periods when the vesting of such awards becomes probable. Determining the probability of award vesting requires judgment, including assumptions about future operating performance. While the assumptions we use to calculate and account for stock-based compensation awards represent management's best estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our management's best judgment. As a result, if we revise our assumptions and estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 40 basis points lower in fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense due to our consolidated financial performance being lower when compared against our incentive-based targets in fiscal 2018 than the prior year.\nBoth the Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes methodologies are based, in part, on inputs for which there are little or no observable market data, requiring us to develop our own assumptions. Inherent in both of these models are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield.\n\u2022 Additionally, fiscal 2019 includes purchase accounting charges related to our acquisitions that were 20 basis points higher in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018.\nRetail Segment\nRevenue Recognition and Related Allowances\n\u2022 Our multi-faceted online strategy to participate in and leverage the growth of online furniture sales. In July 2018 we purchased Joybird, a leading e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture, which positions us for growth in the ever-changing online selling environment and allows us to better reach millennial and Gen X consumers and leverage our supply chain assets. In addition, we continue to increase online sales of La-Z-Boy furniture through la-z-boy.com and other digital players, such as Wayfair and Amazon.\nWe recognize revenue for retail sales and online sales to the end consumer through our company-owned retail stores, www.la-z-boy.com or www.joybird.com once the end consumer has taken control of the furniture, at which point legal title has passed to them. This takes place when the product is delivered to the end consumer's home. Home delivery is not a promised service to our customer, and is not a separate performance obligation, because home delivery is a fulfillment activity as the costs are incurred as part of transferring our product to the end consumer. At the time the end consumer places an order through our company-owned retail stores or www.la-z-boy.com, we collect a deposit on a portion of the total merchandise price. We record this as a customer deposit, which is included in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The balance of the order is paid in full prior to delivery of the product. Once the order is taken through our company-owned retail stores or www.la-z-boy.com we recognize a contract asset for the full order amount and a corresponding deferred revenue liability for the difference between the total order and the deposit collected. The contract asset is included in our other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet and the deferred revenue is included in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. At the time the end consumer places an order through www.joybird.com, we collect the entire amount owed and record this as a customer deposit. Because the entire amount owed is collected at the time of the order, there is no contract asset recorded for Joybird sales.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe majority of our wholesale shipping agreements are freight-on-board shipping point and risk of loss transfers to our customer once the product is out of our control. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations of the types specified as of April 27, 2019:\nWe have various other loss exposures arising from the ordinary course of business, including inventory obsolescence, health insurance, litigation, environmental claims, insured and self-insured workers' compensation, restructuring charges, and product liabilities. Establishing loss reserves requires us to use estimates and management's judgment with respect to risk and ultimate liability. We use legal counsel or other experts, including actuaries as appropriate, to assist us in developing estimates. Due to the uncertainties and potential changes in facts and circumstances, additional charges related to these reserves could be required in the future.\nPension Termination Charge\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur Retail segment's operating margin increased 230 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year, following an increase of 10 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\nFiscal Year 2019, Fiscal Year 2018, and Fiscal Year 2017\nConsolidated sales also benefitted from the acquisition of the Joybird ecommerce business reflected in Corporate & Other.\nOur effective tax rate was 26.4% for fiscal 2019, 36.7% for fiscal 2018, and 33.5% for fiscal 2017.\nDuring fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities was $53.4 million, including $36.0 million used to purchase our common stock and $20.7 million paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends.\n\u2022 Changes in our product mix drove a 1.9% increase in sales. Our product mix shifted to more power units which have a higher average selling price than units without power, and primarily resulted from increased sales of our duo\u00ae product.\nOperating Margin\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nOther Loss Reserves\nWe are the leading global producer of reclining chairs and the second largest manufacturer/distributor of residential furniture in the United States. The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores retail network is the third largest retailer of single-branded furniture in the United States. We manufacture, market, import, export, distribute and retail upholstery furniture products under the La-Z-Boy\u00ae, England, Kincaid\u00ae, and Joybird\u00ae tradenames. In addition, we import, distribute and retail accessories and casegoods (wood) furniture products under the Kincaid\u00ae, American Drew\u00ae, Hammary\u00ae, and Joybird\u00ae tradenames. We have seven major manufacturing locations and six regional distribution centers in the United States and two facilities in Mexico to support our speed-to-market and customization strategy. We operate a wholesale sales office that is responsible for distribution of our product in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We also participate in two joint ventures in Thailand that support our international businesses: one that operates a manufacturing facility and another that operates a wholesale sales office. We operate a global trading company in Hong Kong which helps us manage our Asian supply chain by establishing and maintaining relationships with our Asian suppliers, as well as identifying efficiencies and savings opportunities. We also have contracts with several suppliers in Asia to produce products that support our pure import model for casegoods.\n\u2022 Lower absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities, driven primarily by a decline in production volume, decreased the segment's gross margin by 70 basis points.\n\u2022 Gross margin increased 30 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 20 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nResults of Operations\n\u2022 The sales increases in fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to higher volume we achieved through improved product styling, expanding our floor space with existing retailers, and a reliable in-stock position.\nDuring fiscal 2019, net cash used for investing activities was $122.6 million, primarily due to $76.5 million used for acquisitions and $48.4 million used for capital expenditures. Our cash used for acquisitions during the period included the acquisition of the assets of two independent operators of La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, one that operated nine stores and two warehouses in Arizona and one that operated one store in Massachusetts, as well as the acquisition of Joybird, an e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture. Our capital expenditures during the year primarily related to spending on manufacturing machinery and equipment, construction of our new Innovation Center, upgrades to our Dayton, Tennessee Upholstery manufacturing facility, expansion of our England subsidiary's plant and construction of their new corporate office building, and relocation of one of our regional distribution centers.\nSales\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was relatively flat during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\nOur consolidated balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2019 reflected a $1.0 million net liability for uncertain income tax positions. We do not expect that the net liability for uncertain income tax positions will significantly change within the next 12 months. We will either pay or release the liability for uncertain income tax positions as tax audits are completed or settled, statutes of limitation expire or other new information becomes available.\n\u2022 Fiscal 2019 includes purchase accounting charges related to our acquisitions that were 20 basis points higher in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018.\nSales\nCasegoods Segment\n\u2022 We benefited from favorable absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales dollars in fiscal 2019.\nWe estimate the fair value of each option grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We estimate expected volatility based on the historic volatility of our common shares. We estimate the average expected life using the contractual term of the stock option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination trends. We base the risk-free rate on U.S. Treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We estimate forfeitures at the date of grant based on historic experience.\nImpacting our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was a net tax benefit of $1.4 million primarily from the release of valuation allowances relating to certain U.S. state deferred tax assets and state income tax credits. Absent discrete adjustments, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 would have been 34.6%.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2019 were $48.4 million compared with $36.3 million for fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures were higher in fiscal 2019, primarily due to construction of our new Innovation Center, upgrades to our upholstery manufacturing plant in Dayton, Tennessee, expansion of our England subsidiary plant, and construction of a new corporate office building for our England subsidiary. We have no material contractual commitments outstanding for future capital expenditures. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $50 to $60 million for fiscal 2020, reflecting plant upgrades to our upholstery manufacturing facilities in Dayton, Tennessee and Neosho, Missouri, as well as improvements to several of our retail stores.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 170 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nTrade accounts receivable arise from the sale of products on trade credit terms. On a quarterly basis, we review all significant accounts as to their past due balances, as well as collectability of the outstanding trade accounts receivable for possible write off. It is our policy to write off the accounts receivable against the allowance account when we deem the receivable to be uncollectible. Additionally, we review orders from dealers that are significantly past due, and we ship product only when our ability to collect payment from our customer for the new order is probable.\n\u2022 SG&A expense was 200 basis points higher in fiscal 2019 due to changes in our consolidated sales mix. This increase was driven by the growth of our Retail segment and the acquisition of Joybird, which have a higher level of SG&A expense as a percentage of sales than our Upholstery and Casegoods reportable segments.\nDuring fiscal 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $150.7 million. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income generated during fiscal 2019 as well as a $12.9 million increase in payroll and other compensation due to higher accrued incentive compensation costs that will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nOur board of directors has sole authority to determine if and when we will declare future dividends and on what terms. We expect the board to continue declaring regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, but it may discontinue doing so at any time.\n\u2022 Our gross margin declined in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year, mostly due to a decline in our Upholstery segment's gross margin resulting from increased prices for our three core raw material components of steel, polyurethane foam and wood.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we terminated our defined benefit pension plan for eligible factory hourly employees in our La-Z-Boy operating unit. In connection with the plan termination, we settled all future obligations under the plan through a combination of lump-sum payments to eligible participants who elected to receive them, and transferred any remaining benefit obligations under the plan to a highly rated insurance company. We recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of $32.7 million in our consolidated statement of income associated with the plan termination during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 Partially offsetting these items was a charge for a legal settlement of a civil dispute, which increased SG&A expense as a percentage of sales by 30 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. With the settlement, which resolved all of our past and future obligations at issue in the litigation, we recognized an additional charge of $4.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nDuring fiscal 2019, net cash used for financing activities was $32.8 million, including $23.0 million used to purchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase authorization and $23.5 million paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends. This was partly offset by $13.9 million in cash received upon exercise of employee stock awards, net of shares withheld for taxes.\n\u2022 A shift in product mix resulted in a 70 basis point reduction in the segment's gross margin. The shift in our product mix to more units with power, especially our duo\u00ae product, drives higher gross profit dollars per unit but results in a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales than units without power.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 A charge for a legal settlement of a civil dispute increased SG&A expense as a percentage of sales by 30 basis points. With the settlement, which resolved all of our past and future obligations at issue in the litigation, we recognized an additional charge of $4.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 This was partly offset by lower gross margin in our Upholstery segment, primarily due to higher supply chain costs and changes in our product mix that were not fully offset by higher selling prices.\n\u2022 The sales increase in fiscal 2019 included $67.0 million in sales from acquired stores. In fiscal 2019, delivered same-store sales increased $26.0 million or 5.7%, primarily driven by improved execution at the store level. The remainder of the change in sales during fiscal 2019 was due to the impact of new and closed stores.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset or asset group. Using either quoted market prices or an analysis of undiscounted projected future cash flows by asset groups, we determine whether there is any indicator of impairment requiring us to further assess the fair value of our long-lived assets. Our asset groups consist of our operating segments in our Upholstery reportable segment, our Casegoods segment, each of our retail stores, our Joybird\u00ae business and other corporate assets.\nDuring fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $148.0 million. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income generated during fiscal 2017 and a $12.5 million reduction in inventory. Our ability to improve our inventory efficiency and productivity more than offset an increase in finished goods inventory during fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 Selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nInterest expense was $1.0 million higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of $0.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher average short-term borrowings during the year. A short-term draw of $35 million on our credit line was taken in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and repaid by the end of fiscal 2019, and was used to help fund our acquisitions during the year. Additionally, fiscal 2019 included $0.6 million for fair value adjustments of future guaranteed payments related to the Joybird acquisition.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nSee Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards and other new accounting standards.\n\u2022 Upholstery Segment. Our Upholstery reportable segment is our largest business segment and consists primarily of two operating segments: La-Z-Boy, our largest operating segment, and the\nIn December of 2017, the SEC staff issued guidance which provides that companies that have not completed their accounting for the effects of the Tax Act but can determine a reasonable estimate of those effects should include a provisional amount based on their reasonable estimate in their financial statements. The guidance also allows companies to adjust the provisional amounts during a one-year measurement period which is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. In fiscal 2019, the Company finalized the provisional estimates of $0.2 million recorded in fiscal 2018, with no material change.\n\u2022 These increases were somewhat offset by lower overall unit volume, which resulted in a 1.4% decrease in sales. Volume was flat to the prior year for the first three quarters and only started to decline around the beginning of our fourth quarter, which was in line with the rest of the furniture industry which saw negative growth in the first calendar quarter of 2019 for the first time since the 2008 recession.\nSales\n\u2022 Additionally, in fiscal 2018, we recognized a $1.8 million insurance gain related to a fire in our England subsidiary's corporate office building.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased due to better leverage of fixed costs (primarily occupancy and administrative costs) on increased same-store delivered sales and the benefit of our acquired stores which operate with lower SG&A expense as a percentage of sales compared with our existing stores.\n\nDuring fiscal 2018, net cash used for investing activities was $55.2 million, which included $15.9 million to fund the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, $36.3 million for capital expenditures, and $5.9 million for net investment increases. Capital expenditures during the period primarily related to spending on the construction of our new Innovation Center, manufacturing machinery and equipment, and our continued ERP system implementation. Additionally, under the terms of the purchase agreement for the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, payment for the business was due 90 business days following the date of acquisition, and accordingly, we made that payment during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 SG&A expense included a 30 basis point improvement due to a charge for a legal settlement recorded in fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Our branded distribution channels, which include the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae store network and the La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, our store-within-a-store format. We expect this initiative to generate growth in our Retail segment through an increased company-owned store count and in our wholesale Upholstery segment as our proprietary distribution network expands. We are not only focused on growing the number of locations, but also on upgrading existing store locations to our new concept designs.", "item_7_text": "We believe our cash flows from operations, present cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of $131.8 million, short and long-term investments to enhance returns on cash of $31.5 million, and current excess availability under our credit facility of $148.1 million, will be sufficient to fund our business needs, including fiscal 2020 contractual obligations of $170.9 million as presented in our contractual obligations table. Included in our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at April 27, 2019, is $44.3 million held by foreign subsidiaries for which we have determined the amounts to be permanently reinvested.\nAt the time we recognize revenue, we make provisions for estimated refunds, product returns, and warranties, as well as other incentives that we may offer to customers. When estimating our incentives we utilize either the expected value method or the most likely amount to determine the amount of variable consideration. We use either method depending on which method will provide the best estimate of the variable consideration, and we only include variable consideration when it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Incentives offered to customers include cash discounts, rebates, advertising agreements and other sales incentive programs. Our sales incentives, including cash discounts and rebates, are recorded as a reduction to revenues. Service allowances are for a distinct good or service received from our customer and are recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income, and are not recorded as a reduction of revenue and are not considered variable consideration. We use substantial judgment based on the type of variable consideration or service allowance, historical experience and expected sales volume when estimating these provisions. Sales, value added, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The expected costs associated with our warranties and service allowances are recognized as expense when our products are sold.\nFinancing Activities\n\u2022 Raw material prices increased during the first half of the fiscal year, but then retracted in the back half of the year. For the full fiscal year 2019, changes in raw material prices were flat compared with the prior year.\nOur Corporate and Other operating loss was $10.2 million lower in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nOur reportable operating segments are the Upholstery segment, the Casegoods segment and the Retail segment.\nas the grant date fair value for the award. The final payout of the award as calculated by the model is then discounted back to the grant date using the risk-free interest rate.\n\u2022 This was offset by 60 basis points of higher incentive compensation expense in fiscal 2019 due to the segment's improved financial performance against incentive-based targets in fiscal 2019.\nWe account for product warranties by accruing an estimated liability when we recognize revenue on the sale of warranted product. We estimate future warranty claims based on claim experience and any additional anticipated future costs on previously sold product. We incorporate repair costs in our liability estimates, including materials, labor, and overhead amounts necessary to perform repairs, and any costs associated with delivering repaired product to our customers and consumers. We use considerable judgment in making our estimates. We record differences between our estimated and actual costs when the differences are known.\n\u2022 During the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we enacted changes to our employee vacation policies and reduced our salary vacation liability. This change provided a one-time 20 basis point benefit to SG&A expense.\n\u2022 Changes in our product mix resulted in a 2.0% increase in sales. Our product mix shifted from non-powered fabric units to more leather units with power that have a higher average selling price.\n\n\u2022 In addition, our global trading company in Hong Kong was more profitable, due to the increased intercompany commission revenue we charge to our reportable segments.\nOther expense was $0.6 million higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 and $0.9 million lower in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017, due to a $2.2 million gain on investments recorded in fiscal\n\u2022 Changes in our consolidated sales mix increased our gross margin 130 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year. This benefit was driven by the growth of our Retail segment and the acquisition of Joybird, which have a higher gross margin than our Upholstery and Casegoods reportable segments.\n\u2022 Our company-owned retail business. We are growing this business by increasing same-store sales through improved execution at the store level and by acquiring existing La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores and opening new La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, primarily in markets that can be serviced through our regional distribution centers, where we see opportunity for growth, or where we believe we have opportunities for further market penetration.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019, the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased design services and custom sales. Additionally, gross margin improved due to the benefit of acquired stores, which have gross margins that are slightly higher than our average store. These benefits more than offset the impact of purchase accounting charges resulting from the acquisitions during the year.\nproduct shipments on third-party carriers at the point in time that our product is loaded onto the third-party container or truck and that container or truck leaves our facility. For our imported products, we recognize revenue at the point in time that legal ownership is transferred, which may not occur until after the goods have passed through U.S. Customs. In all cases, this revenue includes amounts we bill to customers for freight charges, because we have elected to treat shipping activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of our product as a fulfillment cost rather than an additional promised service. Because of this election, we recognize revenue for shipping when control of our product passes to our customer, and the shipping costs are accrued when the freight revenue is recognized. Revenue for product shipments on company-owned trucks is recognized for the product and freight at the point in time that our product is delivered to our customer's location.\nThe following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows:\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 200 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 30 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nOur Corporate and Other operating loss was $15.4 million higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2018, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was lower than the prior year due to reducing our discretionary SG&A spending to better align with sales volume.\nDuring fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $115.8 million. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income generated during fiscal 2018 and a $6.6 million increase in accounts payable that is primarily due to standardizing payment terms with our vendors, which resulted in many payment terms being extended.\nOperating Activities\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019 and 2018, gross margin increased compared with each respective prior year due to increased volume and a shift in our product mix to newer, higher-margin collections. In fiscal 2018, this benefit was slightly offset by higher freight expense on imported product versus the prior year.\nOur goodwill relates to the acquisition of La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores and the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the acquisition of Joybird\u00ae, an e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture. The reporting unit for goodwill arising from retail store acquisitions is our Retail operating segment. The reporting unit for goodwill arising from the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland and the acquisition of Joybird is those respective businesses. We establish the fair value for the reporting unit based on the discounted cash flows to determine if the fair value of our goodwill exceeds its carrying value.\n\u2022 Partially offsetting these items were selling price increases, which provided a 90 basis point benefit.\nUpholstery Segment\nWe sell our products to furniture retailers or distributors in the United States, Canada, and approximately 60 other countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand, directly to consumers through stores that we own and operate and through our websites, www.la-z-boy.com and www.joybird.com. The centerpiece of our retail distribution strategy is our network of 353 La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores and 550 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, each dedicated to marketing our La-Z-Boy branded products. We consider this dedicated space to be \"proprietary.\" We own 156 of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores. The remainder of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, as well as all 550 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, are independently owned and operated. La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores help consumers furnish their homes by combining the style, comfort, and quality of La-Z-Boy furniture with our available design services. La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations are defined spaces within larger independent retailers that are dedicated to displaying and selling La-Z-Boy branded products. In total, we have approximately 7.8 million square feet of proprietary floor space dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products in North America. We also have approximately 2.7 million square feet of floor space outside of the United States and Canada dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products. Our other brands, England, American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets, with approximately half of Hammary's sales originating through the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae store network. Kincaid and England have their own dedicated proprietary in-store programs with 590 outlets and approximately 1.9 million square feet of proprietary floor space. In total, our proprietary floor space includes approximately 12.4 million square feet worldwide. Joybird, which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, sells product almost exclusively online and has a limited amount of proprietary retail floor space it uses as a showroom to develop its brand.\n\u2022 The increase in sales in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was driven by sales growth in all three of our operating segments. Our Upholstery segment benefited from the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland and a favorable change in our product mix. Our Casegoods segment grew sales volume by expanding floor space with existing retailers. Our Retail segment sales increased due to the addition of new stores that were not open in the prior-year period and from acquisitions we completed in fiscal 2018.\nCorporate and Other\n\u2022 Incentive compensation costs as a percentage of sales were 80 basis points higher during fiscal 2019 primarily due to our improved consolidated financial performance against our incentive-based targets during fiscal 2019.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOperating Loss\nOther\nOperating Margin\nLa-Z-Boy Incorporated\n\nOur Casegoods segment's sales increased $3.1 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $11.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In some cases, these principles require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties and, as a result, such estimates and assumptions may significantly impact our financial results and disclosures. We base our estimates on currently known facts and circumstances, prior experience and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. We use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may, as warranted, use external advice. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions, and judgments and these differences could be significant. We make frequent comparisons throughout the year of actual experience to our assumptions to reduce the likelihood of significant adjustments. We record adjustments when differences are known. The following critical accounting policies affect our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Margin\nWe drive growth in the following ways:\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019, the decreased SG&A expense was primarily due to changes to our employee vacation policies, which provided a one-time benefit of 20 basis points.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2018, the decreased SG&A expense was due to improved absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales volume, and a reduction in discretionary spending.\nOur allowances for credit losses reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the trade accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historic experience, and other currently available evidence.\nOur Business\nOur Upholstery segment's sales increased $40.9 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $35.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 We benefited from favorable absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales dollars and a reduction in discretionary SG&A spending in fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense as a percentage of sales increased 170 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\nImpacting our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was a net tax expense of $1.2 million primarily from the tax effect of the defined benefit pension plan termination of $2.6 million and a net tax benefit of $1.4 million primarily from excess tax benefits from shared-based payments. Absent discrete adjustments, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 would have been 25.1%.\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate revenues primarily by manufacturing/importing and delivering upholstery and casegoods (wood) furniture products to independent furniture retailers, independently-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores or the end consumer. Each unit of furniture is a separate performance obligation, and we satisfy our performance obligation when control of our product is passed to our customer, which is the point in time that our customers are able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining economic benefit of the goods or services.\n\u2022 Retail Segment. Our Retail segment consists of one operating segment comprising our 156 company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores. The Retail segment primarily sells upholstered furniture, in addition to some casegoods and other accessories, to the end consumer through these stores.\nIntroduction\n\non December 19, 2017, extending its maturity date to December 19, 2022. The credit agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants that apply under certain circumstances, including a fixed-charge coverage ratio requirement that applies when excess availability under the credit line is less than certain thresholds. At April 27, 2019, we were not subject to the fixed-charge coverage ratio requirement, had no borrowings outstanding under the agreement, and had excess availability of $148.1 million of the $150.0 million credit commitment.\nWe have various excess loss coverages for health insurance, auto, product liability and workers' compensation liabilities. Our deductibles generally do not exceed $1.5 million.\n\u2022 Lastly, we recorded a $1.8 million insurance gain during fiscal 2018 following a fire in our England subsidiary's corporate office building. We recognized a gain because the insurance proceeds exceeded the building's net book value on the date of the fire.\nWe have prepared this Management's Discussion and Analysis as an aid to understanding our financial results. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We begin with an introduction to our key businesses and then provide discussions of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and critical accounting policies. Our 2019, 2018 and 2017 fiscal years included 52 weeks.\n\u2022 Gross margin increased 30 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of 20 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nOur Upholstery segment's operating margin decreased 50 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 190 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\n\u2022 Gross margin increased 90 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\nSales\n\u2022 The fiscal 2019 sales increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022 These increases were somewhat offset by lower overall unit volume, which resulted in a 2.5% decrease in sales.\n\u2022 The acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland added sales of $18.9 million.\nEliminations increased in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 compared with each respective prior year due to higher sales from our Upholstery and Casegoods segments to our Retail segment, mainly because of the increased sales in the Retail segment and the impact of acquired stores.\n\u2022 Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other includes the shared costs for corporate functions, including human resources, information technology, finance and legal, in addition to revenue generated through royalty agreements with companies licensed to use the La-Z-Boy\u00ae brand name on various products. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with our other insignificant operating segments including our global trading company in Hong Kong and Joybird, an e-commerce retailer that manufactures and sells upholstered furniture such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, sleeper sofas and beds, and also imports and sells casegoods (wood) furniture such as occasional tables and other accessories. Joybird sells to end consumers almost exclusively online through its website, www.joybird.com. None of the operating segments included in Corporate & Other meet the requirements of reportable segments at this time.\nOperating margin decreased 80 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year, following a decrease of 60 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\n\u2022 SG&A expense was lower by 30 basis points in fiscal year 2019, due to a charge for a legal settlement in fiscal 2018.\nOther Expense\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. When we record deferred tax assets, we are required to estimate, based on forecasts of taxable earnings in the relevant tax jurisdiction, whether we are more likely than not to recover on them. In making judgments about realizing the value of our deferred tax assets, we consider historic and projected future operating results, the eligible carry-forward period, tax law changes and other relevant considerations.\n\u2022 The Corporate and Other operating loss was lower due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense because our consolidated financial performance was lower when compared against our incentive-based targets in fiscal 2018.\nConsolidated sales increased $161.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $63.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility secured primarily by all of our accounts receivable, inventory, and cash deposit and securities accounts. Availability under the agreement fluctuates according to a borrowing base calculated on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. We amended this agreement\nWe explain these items further when we discuss each segment's results later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nDuring fiscal 2018, net cash used for financing activities was $76.3 million, including $56.7 million used to purchase our common stock and $22.0 million paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2018, gross margin decreased slightly due to higher promotional activity as we executed a variety of strategies to drive traffic to our stores and convert that traffic into sales.\nwhen our available-for-sale convertible debt security converted to preferred shares of a privately-held company. Additionally, fiscal year 2018 had higher foreign currency exchange rate losses when compared to both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 Our innovative products, including stain-resistant iCleanTM fabrics and our power products, some of which include dual mechanisms and articulating headrests. Our recent innovation, duo\u00ae, is a revolutionary product line that features the look of stationary furniture with the power to recline at the push of a button. We are committed to innovation throughout our business, and to support these efforts we opened our new state-of-the-art Innovation Center in January 2019 at our Dayton, Tennessee campus.\nWe test intangibles and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets include our American Drew trade name, and the reacquired right to own and operate La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores we have acquired. We have amortizable intangible assets related to the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, which are primarily comprised of acquired customer relationships. We also have an amortizable trade name related to the Joybird\u00ae acquisition. We establish the fair value of our trade names and reacquired rights based upon the relief from royalty method. We establish the fair value of our other amortizable intangible assets based on the multi-period excess earnings method, a variant of the income approach, and also using the relief from royalty method.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted into law. Most of its provisions are effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Because we are a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer, the majority of the provisions, such as elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, new taxes on certain foreign-sourced income, and new limitations on certain business deductions began applying to us in fiscal 2019. As the Company is a fiscal year taxpayer, the lower corporate income tax rate of 21% was phased in, resulting in a blended federal rate of 30.4% for fiscal 2018. The federal rate is 21% for fiscal 2019.\nAll orders are fulfilled within one year of order date, therefore we do not have any unfulfilled performance obligations. Additionally, we elected the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component because at contract inception we expect the period between when we transfer our product to our customer and when the customer pays for the product to be one year or less.\n\n\u2022 Gross margin decreased 60 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Gross margin decreased 80 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 We experienced inflationary pressures in our supply chain which decreased the segment's gross margin by 90 basis points.\nInvesting Activities\nWe estimate the fair value of each performance award grant that vests based on a market condition using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The Monte Carlo model incorporates more complex variables than closed-form models such as the Black-Scholes option valuation model used for option grants. The Monte Carlo valuation model simulates a distribution of stock prices to yield an expected distribution of stock prices over the remaining performance period. The stock-paths are simulated using volatilities calculated with historical information using data from a look-back period that is equal to the vesting period. The model assumes a zero-coupon, risk-free interest rate with a term equal to the vesting period. The simulations are repeated many times and the mean of the discounted values is calculated\nOur Retail segment's sales increased $95.6 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following an increase of $31.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nImpacting our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was a charge of $5.5 million, reflecting the net effect of the Tax Act. This included a $10.0 million charge for the provisional re-measurement of certain deferred taxes and related amounts, $0.2 million of income tax expense for the effects of the transition tax, and a benefit of $4.7 million primarily related to the lower blended federal tax rate. In addition to the above items related to the Tax Act, was a net tax benefit primarily of $2.4 million from research and development credits related to amended prior-year tax returns and the release of valuation allowances relating to certain U.S. state deferred tax assets and state income tax credits. Absent discrete adjustments, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 would have been 30.6%.\n\u2022 Increased prices, primarily for our three core raw material components of steel, polyurethane foam and wood, decreased the segment's gross margin by 80 basis points. The inflationary pressure we experienced from these raw materials was higher than we expected, and during fiscal 2018 we implemented sales price increases to offset the negative impact on our margins.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\u2022 The sales increase in fiscal 2018 was a result of $20.4 million from acquired stores and $14.7 million from new stores that were not open in the prior-year period. Partially offsetting these items was $3.7 million lower delivered same-store sales, a decline of 1.0%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower store traffic, the impact of which was somewhat offset by an increase in average ticket that resulted from increased design services and custom orders.\noperating segment for our England subsidiary. The Upholstery segment also includes our international wholesale businesses. We aggregate these operating segments into one reportable segment because they are economically similar and because they meet the other aggregation criteria for determining reportable segments. Our Upholstery segment manufactures and imports upholstered furniture such as recliners and motion furniture, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans and sleeper sofas. The Upholstery segment sells directly to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, operators of La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, major dealers, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers.\n\n\u2022 Our unique multi-channel distribution network. In addition to our branded distribution channels, over 2,100 other dealers sell La-Z-Boy products, providing us the benefit of multi-channel distribution. These outlets include some of the best-known names in the industry, including Art Van, Nebraska Furniture Mart, and Slumberland. Our other brands, England, American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid, enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets. We believe there is significant growth potential for our brands through these retail channels.\nInterest Expense\n\u2022 Casegoods Segment. Our Casegoods segment consists of one operating segment that sells furniture under three brands: American Drew\u00ae, Hammary\u00ae, and Kincaid\u00ae. The Casegoods segment is an importer, marketer, and distributor of casegoods (wood) furniture such as bedroom sets, dining room sets, entertainment centers and occasional pieces, and also manufactures some custom upholstered furniture. The Casegoods segment sells directly to major dealers, as well as La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers.\nProduct Warranties\n\u2022 Partly offsetting these items was a benefit from favorable absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales dollars in fiscal 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nSales\nOur sources of liquidity include cash and equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, cash from operations, and amounts available under our credit facility. We believe these sources remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, and fulfill other cash requirements for day-to-day operations, dividends to shareholders, and capital expenditures. We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $131.8 million at April 27, 2019, compared with $136.9 million at April 28, 2018. In addition, we had investments to enhance our returns on cash of $31.5 million at April 27, 2019, compared with $34.4 million at April 28, 2018.\nOur Casegoods segment's operating margin increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year, following an increase of 190 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\nOur board of directors has authorized the purchase of company stock. As of April 27, 2019, 5.9 million shares remained available for purchase pursuant to this authorization. The authorization has no expiration date. We purchased 0.8 million shares during fiscal 2019 for a total of $23.0 million. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in purchasing company stock with the cash flows we anticipate generating in fiscal 2020.\n\u2022 The increase in sales in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was driven by growth in both our core businesses and sales from our recent acquisitions. Sales in our Upholstery segment increased due to higher selling prices, favorable changes in our product mix, and higher tariff surcharges on Chinese imported parts. Sales in our Casegoods segment increased due to higher volume. In our Retail segment, sales increased due to our acquired stores and delivered same-store sales increases.\nDuring fiscal 2017, net cash used for investing activities was $65.2 million, which included $35.9 million for acquisitions of retail stores, $20.3 million for capital expenditures, and $9.8 million for net investment increases. Capital expenditures during the period primarily related to spending on manufacturing machinery and equipment, our continued ERP system implementation, and construction of our new Innovation Center.\n\u2022 Our on-trend product including stationary upholstered furniture featured in our Live Life Comfortably\u00ae marketing campaign. While we are known for our iconic recliners, they account for less than half of our sales in dollars, and we believe we have the potential to expand sales of our other products. To stimulate growth, our Live Life Comfortably\u00ae marketing campaign features a celebrity brand ambassador, currently Kristen Bell, and focuses on expanding our digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities to build traffic across our multiple digital and physical properties. We are driving change throughout our digital platforms to improve the user experience, with a specific focus on the ease by which customers browse through our broad assortment, customize products to their liking, find stores to make a purchase, or purchase at www.la-z-boy.com.\nOperating Margin\n\u2022 The benefit of a legal settlement during fiscal 2017 negatively impacted the comparison of the segment's gross margin by 20 basis points.\nOur goal is to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term through executing our strategic initiatives. The foundation of our strategic initiatives is driving profitable sales growth in all areas of our business.\n* We have purchase order commitments of $87.3 million related to open purchase orders, primarily with foreign and domestic casegoods, leather and fabric suppliers, which are generally cancellable if production has not begun.\n\u2022 Gross margin decreased 160 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nWe do not expect our continuing compliance with existing federal, state and local statutes dealing with protection of the environment to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or liquidity.\n\u2022 Fiscal 2019 includes the operating loss and purchase accounting adjustments related to the Joybird acquisition.\n\u2022 This was partly offset by a 20 basis point improvement in fiscal 2018 due to the growth of our Retail segment compared with the prior year, which has a higher gross margin than our wholesale segments.\n\u2022 Higher selling prices resulted in a 0.7% increase in sales. We raised our selling price in response to inflationary pressures on our raw materials.\n\u2022 The fiscal 2018 sales increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022 Price increases in response to inflationary pressure on raw materials resulted in a 1.3% increase in sales, and higher tariff surcharges on Chinese imported parts increased sales by 1.2%.\nSales increased in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of Joybird, which contributed $59.1 million in sales. Sales in fiscal 2018 increased compared with the prior year due to an increase in intercompany commission revenue charged to our reportable segments by our global trading company in Hong Kong.\n\u2022 Incentive compensation costs were higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, primarily due to improved consolidated financial performance against incentive-based targets during fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 Additionally, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points in fiscal 2018, compared with the prior year, due to the growth of our Retail segment, which has a higher level of SG&A expense as a percentage of sales than our wholesale segments.\nWe measure stock-based compensation cost for equity-based awards on the grant date based on the awards' fair value, and recognize expense over the vesting period. We measure stock-based compensation cost for liability-based awards on the grant date based on the awards' fair value, and recognize expense over the vesting period. We remeasure the liability for these awards and adjust their fair value at the end of each reporting period until paid. We recognize compensation cost for stock-based awards that vest based on performance conditions ratably over the vesting periods when the vesting of such awards becomes probable. Determining the probability of award vesting requires judgment, including assumptions about future operating performance. While the assumptions we use to calculate and account for stock-based compensation awards represent management's best estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our management's best judgment. As a result, if we revise our assumptions and estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 40 basis points lower in fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense due to our consolidated financial performance being lower when compared against our incentive-based targets in fiscal 2018 than the prior year.\nBoth the Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes methodologies are based, in part, on inputs for which there are little or no observable market data, requiring us to develop our own assumptions. Inherent in both of these models are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield.\n\u2022 Additionally, fiscal 2019 includes purchase accounting charges related to our acquisitions that were 20 basis points higher in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018.\nRetail Segment\nRevenue Recognition and Related Allowances\n\u2022 Our multi-faceted online strategy to participate in and leverage the growth of online furniture sales. In July 2018 we purchased Joybird, a leading e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture, which positions us for growth in the ever-changing online selling environment and allows us to better reach millennial and Gen X consumers and leverage our supply chain assets. In addition, we continue to increase online sales of La-Z-Boy furniture through la-z-boy.com and other digital players, such as Wayfair and Amazon.\nWe recognize revenue for retail sales and online sales to the end consumer through our company-owned retail stores, www.la-z-boy.com or www.joybird.com once the end consumer has taken control of the furniture, at which point legal title has passed to them. This takes place when the product is delivered to the end consumer's home. Home delivery is not a promised service to our customer, and is not a separate performance obligation, because home delivery is a fulfillment activity as the costs are incurred as part of transferring our product to the end consumer. At the time the end consumer places an order through our company-owned retail stores or www.la-z-boy.com, we collect a deposit on a portion of the total merchandise price. We record this as a customer deposit, which is included in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The balance of the order is paid in full prior to delivery of the product. Once the order is taken through our company-owned retail stores or www.la-z-boy.com we recognize a contract asset for the full order amount and a corresponding deferred revenue liability for the difference between the total order and the deposit collected. The contract asset is included in our other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet and the deferred revenue is included in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. At the time the end consumer places an order through www.joybird.com, we collect the entire amount owed and record this as a customer deposit. Because the entire amount owed is collected at the time of the order, there is no contract asset recorded for Joybird sales.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe majority of our wholesale shipping agreements are freight-on-board shipping point and risk of loss transfers to our customer once the product is out of our control. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations of the types specified as of April 27, 2019:\nWe have various other loss exposures arising from the ordinary course of business, including inventory obsolescence, health insurance, litigation, environmental claims, insured and self-insured workers' compensation, restructuring charges, and product liabilities. Establishing loss reserves requires us to use estimates and management's judgment with respect to risk and ultimate liability. We use legal counsel or other experts, including actuaries as appropriate, to assist us in developing estimates. Due to the uncertainties and potential changes in facts and circumstances, additional charges related to these reserves could be required in the future.\nPension Termination Charge\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur Retail segment's operating margin increased 230 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior year, following an increase of 10 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year.\nFiscal Year 2019, Fiscal Year 2018, and Fiscal Year 2017\nConsolidated sales also benefitted from the acquisition of the Joybird ecommerce business reflected in Corporate & Other.\nOur effective tax rate was 26.4% for fiscal 2019, 36.7% for fiscal 2018, and 33.5% for fiscal 2017.\nDuring fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities was $53.4 million, including $36.0 million used to purchase our common stock and $20.7 million paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends.\n\u2022 Changes in our product mix drove a 1.9% increase in sales. Our product mix shifted to more power units which have a higher average selling price than units without power, and primarily resulted from increased sales of our duo\u00ae product.\nOperating Margin\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nOther Loss Reserves\nWe are the leading global producer of reclining chairs and the second largest manufacturer/distributor of residential furniture in the United States. The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores retail network is the third largest retailer of single-branded furniture in the United States. We manufacture, market, import, export, distribute and retail upholstery furniture products under the La-Z-Boy\u00ae, England, Kincaid\u00ae, and Joybird\u00ae tradenames. In addition, we import, distribute and retail accessories and casegoods (wood) furniture products under the Kincaid\u00ae, American Drew\u00ae, Hammary\u00ae, and Joybird\u00ae tradenames. We have seven major manufacturing locations and six regional distribution centers in the United States and two facilities in Mexico to support our speed-to-market and customization strategy. We operate a wholesale sales office that is responsible for distribution of our product in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We also participate in two joint ventures in Thailand that support our international businesses: one that operates a manufacturing facility and another that operates a wholesale sales office. We operate a global trading company in Hong Kong which helps us manage our Asian supply chain by establishing and maintaining relationships with our Asian suppliers, as well as identifying efficiencies and savings opportunities. We also have contracts with several suppliers in Asia to produce products that support our pure import model for casegoods.\n\u2022 Lower absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities, driven primarily by a decline in production volume, decreased the segment's gross margin by 70 basis points.\n\u2022 Gross margin increased 30 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 20 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nResults of Operations\n\u2022 The sales increases in fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to higher volume we achieved through improved product styling, expanding our floor space with existing retailers, and a reliable in-stock position.\nDuring fiscal 2019, net cash used for investing activities was $122.6 million, primarily due to $76.5 million used for acquisitions and $48.4 million used for capital expenditures. Our cash used for acquisitions during the period included the acquisition of the assets of two independent operators of La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae stores, one that operated nine stores and two warehouses in Arizona and one that operated one store in Massachusetts, as well as the acquisition of Joybird, an e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture. Our capital expenditures during the year primarily related to spending on manufacturing machinery and equipment, construction of our new Innovation Center, upgrades to our Dayton, Tennessee Upholstery manufacturing facility, expansion of our England subsidiary's plant and construction of their new corporate office building, and relocation of one of our regional distribution centers.\nSales\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was relatively flat during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\nOur consolidated balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2019 reflected a $1.0 million net liability for uncertain income tax positions. We do not expect that the net liability for uncertain income tax positions will significantly change within the next 12 months. We will either pay or release the liability for uncertain income tax positions as tax audits are completed or settled, statutes of limitation expire or other new information becomes available.\n\u2022 Fiscal 2019 includes purchase accounting charges related to our acquisitions that were 20 basis points higher in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018.\nSales\nCasegoods Segment\n\u2022 We benefited from favorable absorption of fixed SG&A costs on the higher sales dollars in fiscal 2019.\nWe estimate the fair value of each option grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We estimate expected volatility based on the historic volatility of our common shares. We estimate the average expected life using the contractual term of the stock option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination trends. We base the risk-free rate on U.S. Treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We estimate forfeitures at the date of grant based on historic experience.\nImpacting our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was a net tax benefit of $1.4 million primarily from the release of valuation allowances relating to certain U.S. state deferred tax assets and state income tax credits. Absent discrete adjustments, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 would have been 34.6%.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2019 were $48.4 million compared with $36.3 million for fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures were higher in fiscal 2019, primarily due to construction of our new Innovation Center, upgrades to our upholstery manufacturing plant in Dayton, Tennessee, expansion of our England subsidiary plant, and construction of a new corporate office building for our England subsidiary. We have no material contractual commitments outstanding for future capital expenditures. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $50 to $60 million for fiscal 2020, reflecting plant upgrades to our upholstery manufacturing facilities in Dayton, Tennessee and Neosho, Missouri, as well as improvements to several of our retail stores.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of 170 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nTrade accounts receivable arise from the sale of products on trade credit terms. On a quarterly basis, we review all significant accounts as to their past due balances, as well as collectability of the outstanding trade accounts receivable for possible write off. It is our policy to write off the accounts receivable against the allowance account when we deem the receivable to be uncollectible. Additionally, we review orders from dealers that are significantly past due, and we ship product only when our ability to collect payment from our customer for the new order is probable.\n\u2022 SG&A expense was 200 basis points higher in fiscal 2019 due to changes in our consolidated sales mix. This increase was driven by the growth of our Retail segment and the acquisition of Joybird, which have a higher level of SG&A expense as a percentage of sales than our Upholstery and Casegoods reportable segments.\nDuring fiscal 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $150.7 million. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income generated during fiscal 2019 as well as a $12.9 million increase in payroll and other compensation due to higher accrued incentive compensation costs that will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nOur board of directors has sole authority to determine if and when we will declare future dividends and on what terms. We expect the board to continue declaring regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, but it may discontinue doing so at any time.\n\u2022 Our gross margin declined in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year, mostly due to a decline in our Upholstery segment's gross margin resulting from increased prices for our three core raw material components of steel, polyurethane foam and wood.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we terminated our defined benefit pension plan for eligible factory hourly employees in our La-Z-Boy operating unit. In connection with the plan termination, we settled all future obligations under the plan through a combination of lump-sum payments to eligible participants who elected to receive them, and transferred any remaining benefit obligations under the plan to a highly rated insurance company. We recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of $32.7 million in our consolidated statement of income associated with the plan termination during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\n\u2022 Partially offsetting these items was a charge for a legal settlement of a civil dispute, which increased SG&A expense as a percentage of sales by 30 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. With the settlement, which resolved all of our past and future obligations at issue in the litigation, we recognized an additional charge of $4.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nDuring fiscal 2019, net cash used for financing activities was $32.8 million, including $23.0 million used to purchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase authorization and $23.5 million paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends. This was partly offset by $13.9 million in cash received upon exercise of employee stock awards, net of shares withheld for taxes.\n\u2022 A shift in product mix resulted in a 70 basis point reduction in the segment's gross margin. The shift in our product mix to more units with power, especially our duo\u00ae product, drives higher gross profit dollars per unit but results in a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales than units without power.\n\u2022 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 A charge for a legal settlement of a civil dispute increased SG&A expense as a percentage of sales by 30 basis points. With the settlement, which resolved all of our past and future obligations at issue in the litigation, we recognized an additional charge of $4.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 This was partly offset by lower gross margin in our Upholstery segment, primarily due to higher supply chain costs and changes in our product mix that were not fully offset by higher selling prices.\n\u2022 The sales increase in fiscal 2019 included $67.0 million in sales from acquired stores. In fiscal 2019, delivered same-store sales increased $26.0 million or 5.7%, primarily driven by improved execution at the store level. The remainder of the change in sales during fiscal 2019 was due to the impact of new and closed stores.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset or asset group. Using either quoted market prices or an analysis of undiscounted projected future cash flows by asset groups, we determine whether there is any indicator of impairment requiring us to further assess the fair value of our long-lived assets. Our asset groups consist of our operating segments in our Upholstery reportable segment, our Casegoods segment, each of our retail stores, our Joybird\u00ae business and other corporate assets.\nDuring fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $148.0 million. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income generated during fiscal 2017 and a $12.5 million reduction in inventory. Our ability to improve our inventory efficiency and productivity more than offset an increase in finished goods inventory during fiscal 2017.\n\u2022 Selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.\nInterest expense was $1.0 million higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, following a decrease of $0.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher average short-term borrowings during the year. A short-term draw of $35 million on our credit line was taken in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and repaid by the end of fiscal 2019, and was used to help fund our acquisitions during the year. Additionally, fiscal 2019 included $0.6 million for fair value adjustments of future guaranteed payments related to the Joybird acquisition.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nSee Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards and other new accounting standards.\n\u2022 Upholstery Segment. Our Upholstery reportable segment is our largest business segment and consists primarily of two operating segments: La-Z-Boy, our largest operating segment, and the\nIn December of 2017, the SEC staff issued guidance which provides that companies that have not completed their accounting for the effects of the Tax Act but can determine a reasonable estimate of those effects should include a provisional amount based on their reasonable estimate in their financial statements. The guidance also allows companies to adjust the provisional amounts during a one-year measurement period which is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. In fiscal 2019, the Company finalized the provisional estimates of $0.2 million recorded in fiscal 2018, with no material change.\n\u2022 These increases were somewhat offset by lower overall unit volume, which resulted in a 1.4% decrease in sales. Volume was flat to the prior year for the first three quarters and only started to decline around the beginning of our fourth quarter, which was in line with the rest of the furniture industry which saw negative growth in the first calendar quarter of 2019 for the first time since the 2008 recession.\nSales\n\u2022 Additionally, in fiscal 2018, we recognized a $1.8 million insurance gain related to a fire in our England subsidiary's corporate office building.\n\u2022 During fiscal 2019, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased due to better leverage of fixed costs (primarily occupancy and administrative costs) on increased same-store delivered sales and the benefit of our acquired stores which operate with lower SG&A expense as a percentage of sales compared with our existing stores.\n\nDuring fiscal 2018, net cash used for investing activities was $55.2 million, which included $15.9 million to fund the acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, $36.3 million for capital expenditures, and $5.9 million for net investment increases. Capital expenditures during the period primarily related to spending on the construction of our new Innovation Center, manufacturing machinery and equipment, and our continued ERP system implementation. Additionally, under the terms of the purchase agreement for the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, payment for the business was due 90 business days following the date of acquisition, and accordingly, we made that payment during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 SG&A expense included a 30 basis point improvement due to a charge for a legal settlement recorded in fiscal 2018.\n\u2022 Our branded distribution channels, which include the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries\u00ae store network and the La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio\u00ae locations, our store-within-a-store format. We expect this initiative to generate growth in our Retail segment through an increased company-owned store count and in our wholesale Upholstery segment as our proprietary distribution network expands. We are not only focused on growing the number of locations, but also on upgrading existing store locations to our new concept designs.", "item_7_tables": "Table 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>
