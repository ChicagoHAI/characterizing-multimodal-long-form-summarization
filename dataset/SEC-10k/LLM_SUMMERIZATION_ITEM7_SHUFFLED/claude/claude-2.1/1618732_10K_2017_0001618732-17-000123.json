Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is July 31. Our fiscal quarters end on October 31, January 31, April 30 and July 31. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe provide a leading next-generation enterprise cloud operating system that converges traditional silos of server, virtualization, storage and networking into one integrated solution and unifies private and public cloud into a single software fabric. Our software delivers the agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of the public cloud, while addressing enterprise requirements of application mobility, security, data integrity and control. We provide our customers with the flexibility to selectively utilize the public cloud for suitable workloads and specific use cases by enabling increasing levels of application mobility across private and public clouds. We have combined advanced web-scale technologies with elegant consumer-grade design to deliver a powerful enterprise cloud operating system that elevates IT organizations by enabling them to focus on the applications and services that power their businesses. Our invisible infrastructure provides constant availability and low-touch management, enables application mobility across computing environments and reduces inefficiencies in IT planning.\nOur solution can be delivered either as an appliance that is configured to order or as software only. When end-customers purchase our operating system, they typically also purchase one or more years of support and maintenance in order to receive software upgrades, bug fixes and parts replacement. Product revenue is generated primarily from the sales of our solution, and is generally recognized upon shipment. Support and other services revenue is derived from the related support and maintenance contracts, and is recognized ratably over the term of the support contracts.\nWe had a broad and diverse base of 7,051 end-customers as of July 31, 2017, including approximately 559 Global 2000 enterprises. Since shipping our first product in fiscal 2012, our end-customer base has grown rapidly. The number of end-customers grew from 3,768 as of July 31, 2016 to 7,051 as of July 31, 2017. Our operating system is primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors and resellers, and delivered directly to our end-customers. A major part of our sales and marketing investment is to educate our end-customers about the benefits of our solution, particularly as we continue to pursue large enterprises and mission critical workloads. Our solutions serve a broad range of workloads, including enterprise applications, databases, virtual desktop infrastructure, or VDI, unified communications and big data analytics and we have recently announced the capability to support both virtualized and non-virtualized applications. We have end-customers across a broad range of industries, such as automotive, consumer goods, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media, public sector, retail, technology and telecommunications. We also sell to service providers, who utilize our operating system to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers.\nWe have invested heavily in the growth of our business, including the development of our solutions, build-out of our global sales force and the acquisitions of Calm.io Pte. Ltd., or Calm, and PernixData, Inc., or PernixData, during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The number of our full-time employees increased from 1,980 as of July 31, 2016 to 2,813 as of July 31, 2017. We have recruited an engineering team focused on distributed systems and IT infrastructure technologies at our San Jose, California headquarters and at our research and development centers in Bangalore, India, Durham, North Carolina and Seattle, Washington. We have also expanded our international sales and marketing presence by continuing to build out our global teams. We intend to continue to invest in our global engineering team to enhance the functionality of our operating system, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership, as well as continue to expand our global sales and marketing teams.\nOur total revenue was $444.9 million and $766.9 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 72.4%. Our net losses were $168.5 million and $458.0 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Net cash generated from operations was $3.6 million and $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Free cash flow was an outflow of $38.7 million and $36.4 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. As of July 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $899.8 million.\nInitial Public Offering\nIn October 2016, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of Class A common stock, in which we sold 17,100,500 shares, including 2,230,500 shares pursuant to the underwriters' over-allotment option. The shares were sold at an IPO price of $16.00 per share for net proceeds of $254.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $19.2 million. We incurred offering costs of $5.3 million.\nKey Financial and Performance Metrics\nWe monitor the following key financial and performance metrics:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of and for the\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended July 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>766,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year-over-year percentage increase\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>637,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deferred revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>526,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49,002\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,359\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>420,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>644,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total end-customers\n</td> <td>1,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures\nWe regularly monitor billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses, which are non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures, to help us evaluate our growth and operational efficiencies, measure our performance and identify trends in our sales activity, and establish our budgets. We evaluate these measures because they:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>are used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our performance and trends as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>are widely used by investors and other parties in understanding and evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>are used by management to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational and compensation plans, as well as to assess the extent of achievement of goals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBillings is a performance measure which our management believes provides useful information to investors because it represents the amounts under binding purchase orders received by us during a given period that have been billed. Free cash flow is a performance measure that our management believes provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash (used in) generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. We use these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures such as stock-based compensation expense that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. Billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses are not substitutes for total revenue, gross margin percentage, cash (used in) provided by operating activities, or GAAP operating expenses, respectively. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. We urge you to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nWe calculate our non-GAAP measures as follows:\nBillings-We calculate billings by adding the change in deferred revenue (net of acquisitions) between the start and end of the period to total revenue recognized in the same period.\nAdjusted gross margin percentage-We calculate adjusted gross margin percentage as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenue. We define adjusted gross profit as our gross profit adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Our presentation of adjusted gross margin percentage should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nFree cash flow-We calculate free cash flow as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities adjusted with purchases of property and equipment, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations after our capital expenditures.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses-We define non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and the related income tax impact and costs associated with business acquisitions (such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, revaluation of contingent consideration, income tax related impact, and other acquisition-related costs). Our presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended July 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>766,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in deferred revenue (net of acquisitions)\n</td> <td>67,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billings (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>637,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>439,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted gross profit (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted gross margin percentage (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(23,308\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50,181\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49,002\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,359\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>259,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>439,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>(16,059\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,697\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(218,014\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,924\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(915\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business acquisition-related costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>non-GAAP operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>420,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>644,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. See the section titled Risk Factors\u201d. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nInvestment in Growth\nWe plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing so that we can capitalize on our market opportunity, and as part of this, we intend to specifically expand our focus on opportunities with major accounts and large deals, which we define as transactions over $500,000 in committed value. We have significantly increased our sales and marketing personnel, which grew by 42% from July 31, 2016 to July 31, 2017. We estimate, based on past experience, that sales team members typically become fully ramped around the time of the start of their fourth quarter of employment with us, and as our newer employees ramp up, we expect their increased productivity to contribute to our revenue growth. As of July 31, 2017, we considered 59% of our global sales team members to be fully productive, while the remaining 41% of our global sales team members are in the process of ramping up. As we shift the focus of some of our new and existing sales team members to major accounts and large deals, it may take longer for these sales team members to become fully productive, and there may also be an impact to the overall productivity of our sales team. We are focused on actively managing this realignment, and expect continuing improvement over the coming quarters. We intend to continue to grow our global sales and marketing team to acquire new end-customers and to increase sales to existing end-customers.\nWe also intend to continue to grow our research and development and global engineering team to enhance our solutions, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners, and broaden the range of IT infrastructure technologies that we converge into our operating system. We believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may adversely affect our profitability in the near term.\nMarket Adoption of Our Products\nThe public cloud has changed IT buyer expectations about the simplicity, agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of IT resources, which represent a major architectural shift and business model evolution. A key focus of our sales and marketing efforts is creating market awareness about the benefits of our operating system, both as compared to traditional data center architectures as well as the public cloud, particularly as we continue to pursue large enterprises and mission critical workloads. The broad nature of the technology shift that our operating system represents and the relationships our end-customers have with existing IT vendors sometimes lead to unpredictable sales cycles, which we hope to compress and stabilize as market adoption increases, as we gain leverage with our channel partners and as our sales and marketing efforts expand. Our business and operating results will be significantly affected by the degree to and speed with which organizations adopt our operating system.\nLeveraging Channel and OEM Partners\nWe plan to continue to strengthen and expand our network of channel and OEM partners to increase sales to both new and existing end-customers. We believe that increasing channel leverage by investing aggressively in sales enablement and co-marketing with our partners will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of end-customers. Our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by our success in leveraging and expanding our network of channel and OEM partners.\nContinued Purchases and Upgrades within Existing Customer Base\nOur end-customers typically deploy our technology for a specific workload initially. After a new end-customer's initial order, which includes the product and associated maintenance, support and services, we focus on expanding our footprint by serving more workloads. We also generate recurring revenue from our support and maintenance renewals. We view continued purchases and upgrades as critical drivers of our success, as the sales cycles are typically shorter compared to new end-customer deployments and selling efforts are typically less. As of July 31, 2017, approximately 74% of our end-customers who have been with us for 18 months or more have made a repeat purchase, which is defined as any purchase activity, including support and maintenance renewals, subsequent to the initial purchase. Additionally, end-customers who have been with us for 18 months or more have total lifetime orders (which includes the initial order) to date in an amount that is more than 4.8x greater, on average, than their initial order. This number increases to approximately 8.1x, on average, for our 559 Global 2000 end-customers and to more than 18.8x, on average, for our top 25 end-customers as of July 31, 2017. The multiples exclude the effect of one end-customer who had a very large and irregular purchase pattern that we believe is not representative of the purchase patterns of all our other end-customers. Our business and operating results will depend on our ability to sell additional products to our current existing and future base of end-customers.\nChanges in Product Mix and Associated Accounting Impact\nShifts in the mix of whether our solutions are sold as an appliance or as software-only could result in fluctuations in our revenue and gross margins. Software-only sales typically reflect higher gross margins and lower revenue in a given period, since the sale does not include the revenue or cost of the hardware components in an appliance. When we sell our solution as an appliance, the revenue for the appliance and the basic version of our software included in the appliance is generally recognized upon delivery, whereas revenue from software-only transactions is only recognized upon delivery to the extent we have established vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair value of the related maintenance and support contracts, otherwise revenue for the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized over the term of our maintenance and support contracts. Historically, most of our solutions have been delivered on an appliance, and, as a result, most of our historical product revenue has been recognized upon delivery. However, we anticipate that to the extent that broad market adoption of our solutions continues to increase, there may be an increase in the delivery of our software licenses on separately procured hardware. For additional information on our revenue recognition and VSOE, please see the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will be effective for us beginning August 1, 2018, and permits us the ability to early adopt on August 1, 2017. The standard permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).\nThe new standard would have been effective for us beginning in August 1, 2018, however, we elected to early adopt the standard effective August 1, 2017 using the full retrospective method, which requires us to restate our historical financial information for fiscal 2016 and 2017 to be consistent with the standard. The most significant impact of the standard relates to the timing of revenue recognition for certain software licenses sold with post contract support, or PCS, for which we do not have VSOE under current guidance. Under the new standard the requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements is eliminated and we will recognize revenue for such software licenses upon transfer of control to our customers. In addition, the adoption of ASC 606 will also result in differences in the timing of recognition of contract costs, such as sales commissions, as well as the corresponding impacts to provision for income taxes.\nThe adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of $58.5 million and $79.0 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively, an increase in gross profit of $58.5 million and $79.0 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively, a decrease in sales and marketing expense of $1.9 million in fiscal 2016 and an increase in sales and marketing expense of $0.5 million in fiscal 2017, and a decrease in loss from operations of $60.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $78.5 million in fiscal 2017. In addition, the adoption of the standard will result in a decrease in total net deferred revenue of $78.0 million and $157.0 million as of July 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of software licenses sold with PCS for which we do not have VSOE, and an increase in total deferred commissions of $12.6 million and $12.1 million as of July 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, which will be recognized in sales and marketing expense in future periods. The adoption of the standard will have no significant impact to the provision for income taxes and will have no impact to cash from or used in operating, investing, or financing on our consolidated statements of cash flows. For additional information on the expected impacts to reported results, see Note 2 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nOur results of operations for fiscal 2017 include (i) stock-based compensation related to stock awards with performance conditions, referred to as the performance stock awards, due to our IPO and (ii) the impact of the Calm and PernixData acquisitions, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. No expense associated with the performance stock awards was recorded prior to our IPO, as the qualifying event (IPO) had not been deemed probable (see Note 11 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Beginning in fiscal 2014, we began granting performance stock awards with vesting subject to (i) continuous service with us and (ii) satisfaction of one or more performance conditions (a liquidity event or both a liquidity event and certain performance targets). As a result of our IPO, we began to recognize stock-based compensation expense related to the performance stock awards during the three months ended October 31, 2016 as the performance condition, a liquidity event or IPO, was deemed probable of achievement.\nRevenue\nProduct revenue. We generate our product revenue from the sales of our solutions, delivered both on a hardware appliance as well as software-only. Our revenue from software-only sales, which currently constitute a small portion of our product revenue, is subject to industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance and has typically been deferred and recognized over the contractual support period associated with the delivered software licenses. However, revenue associated with certain software licenses can be recognized upon delivery to our end-customers to the extent we have established VSOE for related support and other services.\nSupport and other services revenue. We generate our support and other services revenue primarily from support and maintenance contracts, and, to a lesser extent, from professional services. The majority of our product sales are sold in conjunction with support and maintenance contracts with terms ranging from one to five years. We recognize revenue from support and maintenance contracts over the contractual service period. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of product revenue. Cost of product revenue consists of costs paid to third-party contract manufacturers, which includes hardware costs, personnel costs (consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation) associated with our operations function and allocated costs (which consist of certain facilities, depreciation and amortization, recruiting, and information technology costs allocated based on headcount). We expect our cost of product revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our product revenue increases.\nCost of support and other services revenue. Cost of support and other services revenue includes personnel and operating costs associated with our global customer support organization as well as allocated costs. We expect our cost of support and other services revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our support and other services revenue increases.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses, and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation expense.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expense also includes sales commissions, costs for promotional activities and other marketing costs, travel costs, and costs associated with demonstration units, including depreciation and allocated costs. Commissions are deferred and recognized as we recognize the associated revenue. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our global sales and marketing organizations. Our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nResearch and development. Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel costs, as well as other direct and allocated costs. We have devoted our product development efforts primarily to enhancing the functionality and expanding the capabilities of our solutions. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, which include our executive, finance, human resources and legal organizations. General and administrative expense also includes outside professional services, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and other consulting costs, as well as insurance and other costs associated with being a public company and allocated costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars particularly due to additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs associated with both our growth and operating as a public company, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nOther Income (Expense)-net\nOther income (expense)-net consists primarily of interest income and expense, foreign exchange gains or losses and gains or losses on investments. Upon the completion of our IPO, we reclassified the convertible preferred stock warrants, which, prior to our IPO, were classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded as other expense, into warrants to purchase Class B common stock. As a result, the convertible preferred stock liability was re-measured to its then fair value, which was based on the closing per share price of our Class A common stock on October 4, 2016, and reclassified to additional paid-in capital. Subsequent to the conversion of our convertible preferred stock warrants in connection with our IPO, we no longer remeasure them at fair value or incur any charges related to changes in fair value. In addition, during the three months ended October 31, 2016, we fully repaid our outstanding $75.0 million of senior notes due April 15, 2019, or the senior notes, and incurred a loss on debt extinguishment.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our federal and state net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the years presented:\nTable

The increase in cost of product revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was mainly due to the corresponding year-over-year increase in product sales, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million as a result of our IPO, and the $1.3 million amortization of intangible assets related to our business acquisitions in fiscal 2017. Additionally, starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the cost of certain of our hardware components, specifically DRAM and NAND, increased due to supply constraints.\nProduct gross margin increased from 60% in fiscal 2015 to 62% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to cost savings achieved from our procurement process, and changes in product mix. Product gross margin decreased from 62% in fiscal 2016 to 57% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in amortization of intangible assets. This was partially offset by cost savings achieved in our procurement process, and changes in product mix. We expect to see continued pressure on the costs of DRAM and NAND as a result of continued supply constraints in fiscal 2018 and we expect these costs to continue to increase so long as the DRAM and NAND markets remain supply constrained.\nCost of support and other services revenue\nThe increase in cost of support and other services revenue was primarily due to higher personnel costs of our global customer support organization, as our customer support and services headcount increased in order to support our growing end-customer base.\nCost of support and other services revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2016 and 2017 primarily due to higher personnel costs from our global customer support organization, resulting from increases in our customer support and services headcount of 113% from July 31, 2015 to July 31, 2016 and 62% from July 31, 2016 to July 31, 2017. The increase in cost of support and other services revenue in fiscal 2017 was also driven by a $9.4 million year-over-year increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO.\nSupport and other services gross margin in fiscal 2016 improved compared to fiscal 2015 as we continued to gain leverage from our support organization. Support and other services gross margin in fiscal 2017 decreased compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense mentioned above.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of total revenue\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2016 and 2017 primarily due to higher personnel costs and sales commissions, as our sales and marketing headcount increased year-over-year by 70% in fiscal 2016 and 42% in fiscal 2017. The year-over-year increase in fiscal 2017 in sales and marketing personnel costs includes a $70.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO.

The net deferred tax liability from the PernixData acquisition provided an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of the pre-existing deferred tax assets and, as a result, we released a portion of the U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance. We continue to maintain full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.\nThe year-over-year increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher foreign taxes as a result of higher taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions as we continued to expand globally.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of July 31, 2017, we had $138.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $210.7 million of short-term investments.\nPrior to our IPO, we satisfied our liquidity needs primarily through the sale of convertible preferred stock, senior notes, borrowings from our credit facilities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In October 2016, we completed our IPO of Class A common stock and received net proceeds of $254.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $19.2 million, but before deducting offering costs of $5.3 million. Additionally, in September 2016, we fully repaid the outstanding balance of our senior notes. As of July 31, 2017, we did not have any outstanding borrowings.\nAs discussed above, we have previously granted performance stock awards with vesting subject to satisfaction of one or more performance conditions, including a liquidity event condition tied to our IPO. Certain of those performance stock awards began to vest during the three months ending April 30, 2017, and, subject to the terms of the underlying awards, will continue to vest periodically thereafter. In February 2017, we changed the method by which withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of such performance stock awards held by our executive officers would be covered to be consistent with that of the rest of our employee population. As a result, in addition to our general employee population being required to sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon vesting of their performance stock awards in order to cover any required withholding taxes, or sell-to-cover, our executive officers will now also be required to fund any withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of their performance stock awards through a sell-to-cover, as opposed to our previous approach of retaining a number of shares with a value equal to the amount of the tax and remitting cash to the appropriate taxing authorities, or net share settlement. The sell-to-cover approach allows us to avoid the large cash outflows that would have otherwise been required to satisfy withholding tax obligations resulting from the vesting of performance stock awards, including those held by our executive officers, under the net share settlement approach. In addition, as compared to the net share settlement approach, sell-to-cover will result in more shares being issued into the market as employees' performance stock awards vest, thereby increasing the dilutive impact of our share-based compensation programs on shareholders.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(106,667\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(176,094\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>142,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>201,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities was $3.6 million and $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively.

In September 2016, we repaid the entire outstanding principal amount of the senior notes and incurred $3.3 million of loss on debt extinguishment.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of July 31, 2017:\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year to\n3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase commitments(1)\n</td> <td>26,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers(2)\n</td> <td>72,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration(3)\n</td> <td>5,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Purchase obligations pertaining to our normal operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Commitments with our contract manufacturers, which consist of obligations for on-hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders for certain components.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Represents $7.5 million contingent payments, net of $1.8 million working capital adjustment, assumed in the PernixData acquisition.

We record a charge to cost of product sales for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with the contract manufacturers for non-standard components when and if quantities exceed our future demand forecasts. Our historical charges have not been material.\nAs of July 31, 2017, we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of July 31, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from two sources: (i) product revenue, which consists of hardware combined with software and software-only revenue, and (ii) support and service revenue which includes PCS and professional services. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:\nPersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We rely on sales agreements and purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement.\nDelivery has occurred. We typically recognize product revenue upon shipment, when title and risk of loss are transferred to our partners at that time. Service revenue is recognized as services are performed.\nThe fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. Payment from partners is not contingent upon the partners receiving payments from end-customers.\nCollectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based on a credit analysis and payment history.\nMost of our arrangements are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, support and maintenance and other professional services. Products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting. Hardware deliverables include proprietary software, which together deliver the essential functionality of the products. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: VSOE of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price are available. Other than certain PCS related deliverables, we have not established VSOE of fair value and TPE typically cannot be obtained, therefore we typically allocate consideration to deliverables based on BESP. Our process to determine VSOE is based upon the evaluation of normal pricing and discount practices on deliverables when they are sold separately. Our process to determine BESP for our products and services is based on qualitative and quantitative considerations of multiple factors, which primarily include historical sales, margin objectives and discount behavior. Additional considerations are given to other factors such as customer demographics, costs to manufacture products or provide services, pricing practices and market conditions.\nCommissions\nCommissions consist of direct incremental costs paid to our sales force related to customer orders. Commissions are expensed over the same period that revenue is recognized from the related customer order. Deferred commissions are recoverable through the revenue streams that will be recognized under the related orders. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.\nWe recognize uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards including stock options and purchase rights issued to employees under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, based on estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. We use Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of a stock option and ESPP purchase rights. The fair value of a restricted stock unit, or RSU, is measured using the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock options and RSUs is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally four years. For stock-based awards granted to employees with a performance condition, we recognize stock-based compensation expense for these awards under the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period when management determines it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. The fair value of the ESPP purchase rights is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our board of directors, with input from management, exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each grant date, including but not limited to, (i) contemporaneous valuations of common stock performed by unrelated third-party specialists; (ii) recent private stock sales transactions; (iii) the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; (iv) the lack of marketability of our common stock; (v) developments in the business; (vi) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or a merger or acquisition of our business, given prevailing market conditions; (vii) the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; (viii) our actual operating and financial performance; (ix) U.S. and global capital market conditions; (x) the illiquidity of stock-based awards involving securities in a private company; (xi) our stage of development; and (xii) our history and the timing of the introduction of new products and services.\nSubsequent to our IPO, we use the market closing price for our Class A common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. To determine the expected term, we generally apply the simplified approach in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date of the award as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis for an estimate of expected term.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities approximately equal to the term of employee stock option awards.\nExpected Volatility. As we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option awards. Industry peers consist of several public companies in our industry which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle or financial leverage and were the same as the comparable companies used in the common stock valuation analyses.\nDividend Rate. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use a dividend rate of zero.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our acquisitions using the acquisition method. Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities. Although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities obtained during the measurement period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of such assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the one-year measurement period.\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessment\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, in a business combination, and is allocated to our single reporting unit. We review our goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful, such as in-process research and development, or IPR&D, for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. We operate under one reporting unit and for our annual goodwill impairment test, we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our enterprise value. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment analysis will be performed. The Company compares the fair value of its reporting unit with its carrying amount and if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.\nIPR&D is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the related technology to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nTo date, we have not recorded any impairment charges related to our goodwill and intangible assets. However, deteriorating market conditions or any future events that negatively impact our business may result in an impairment charge.\nWe will start amortizing the in-process R&D during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 over a useful life of between 5 to 7 years as the related technology was completed and released in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 2.

Cost of support and other services revenue includes personnel and operating costs associated with our global customer support organization as well as allocated costs. We expect our cost of support and other services revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our support and other services revenue increases.\nSales and marketing expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2016 and 2017 primarily due to higher personnel costs and sales commissions, as our sales and marketing headcount increased year-over-year by 70% in fiscal 2016 and 42% in fiscal 2017. The year-over-year increase in fiscal 2017 in sales and marketing personnel costs includes a $70.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO.

As we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option awards.

common stock valuation analyses.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $176.1 million for fiscal 2017 was due to $242.5 million of purchases of investments using a significant portion of the proceeds from our IPO and $50.2 million of purchases of property and equipment as we continue to invest in the longer term growth of our business, partially offset by $84.2 million of maturities and

personnel costs of our global customer support organization, as our customer support and services headcount increased in order to support our growing end-customer base.\nWe provide a leading next-generation enterprise cloud operating system that converges traditional silos of server, virtualization, storage and networking into one integrated solution and unifies private and public cloud into a single software fabric. Our software delivers the agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of the public cloud, while addressing enterprise requirements of application mobility, security, data integrity and control. We provide our customers with the flexibility to selectively utilize the public cloud for suitable workloads and specific use cases by enabling increasing levels of application mobility across private and public clouds. We have combined advanced web-scale technologies with elegant consumer-grade design to deliver a powerful enterprise cloud operating system that elevates IT organizations by enabling them to focus on the applications and services that power their businesses. Our invisible infrastructure provides constant availability and low-touch management, enables application mobility across computing environments and reduces inefficiencies in IT planning.\n\nSales and marketing\nFrom time to time, we make commitments with our contract manufacturer, which consist of obligations for on-hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders for non-standard components. We record a charge to cost of product sales for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with the contract manufacturers for non-standard components when and if quantities exceed our future demand forecasts. Our historical charges have not been material.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCost of support and other services revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2016 and 2017 primarily due to higher personnel costs from our global customer support organization, resulting from increases in our customer support and services headcount of 113% from July 31, 2015 to July 31, 2016 and 62% from July 31, 2016 to July 31, 2017. The increase in cost of support and other services revenue in fiscal 2017 was also driven by a $9.4 million year-over-year increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO.\nMarket Adoption of Our Products\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.\nRevenue\nCost of support and other services revenue\nThe year-over-year increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to increases in foreign taxes as a result of higher taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions as we continued our global expansion, partially offset by a $1.5 million partial release of the U.S. valuation allowance from the PernixData acquisition. The net deferred tax liability from the PernixData acquisition provided an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of the pre-existing deferred tax assets and, as a result, we released a portion of the U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance. We continue to maintain full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.\nResults of Operations\nBusiness Combinations\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessment\nThe public cloud has changed IT buyer expectations about the simplicity, agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of IT resources, which represent a major architectural shift and business model evolution. A key focus of our sales and marketing efforts is creating market awareness about the benefits of our operating system, both as compared to traditional data center architectures as well as the public cloud, particularly as we continue to pursue large enterprises and mission critical workloads. The broad nature of the technology shift that our operating system represents and the relationships our end-customers have with existing IT vendors sometimes lead to unpredictable sales cycles, which we hope to compress and stabilize as market adoption increases, as we gain leverage with our channel partners and as our sales and marketing efforts expand. Our business and operating results will be significantly affected by the degree to and speed with which organizations adopt our operating system.\nThe new standard would have been effective for us beginning in August 1, 2018, however, we elected to early adopt the standard effective August 1, 2017 using the full retrospective method, which requires us to restate our historical financial information for fiscal 2016 and 2017 to be consistent with the standard. The most significant impact of the standard relates to the timing of revenue recognition for certain software licenses sold with post contract support, or PCS, for which we do not have VSOE under current guidance. Under the new standard the requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements is eliminated and we will recognize revenue for such software licenses upon transfer of control to our customers. In addition, the adoption of ASC 606 will also result in differences in the timing of recognition of contract costs, such as sales commissions, as well as the corresponding impacts to provision for income taxes.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities approximately equal to the term of employee stock option awards.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLeveraging Channel and OEM Partners\nCommissions\nInvestment in Growth\nCash Flows\nSubsequent to our IPO, we use the market closing price for our Class A common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant.\n\n(2) Includes amortization of intangible assets as follows:\nWe had a broad and diverse base of 7,051 end-customers as of July 31, 2017, including approximately 559 Global 2000 enterprises. Since shipping our first product in fiscal 2012, our end-customer base has grown rapidly. The number of end-customers grew from 3,768 as of July 31, 2016 to 7,051 as of July 31, 2017. Our operating system is primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors and resellers, and delivered directly to our end-customers. A major part of our sales and marketing investment is to educate our end-customers about the benefits of our solution, particularly as we continue to pursue large enterprises and mission critical workloads. Our solutions serve a broad range of workloads, including enterprise applications, databases, virtual desktop infrastructure, or VDI, unified communications and big data analytics and we have recently announced the capability to support both virtualized and non-virtualized applications. We have end-customers across a broad range of industries, such as automotive, consumer goods, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media, public sector, retail, technology and telecommunications. We also sell to service providers, who utilize our operating system to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nOther income (expense)-net consists primarily of interest income and expense, foreign exchange gains or losses and gains or losses on investments. Upon the completion of our IPO, we reclassified the convertible preferred stock warrants, which, prior to our IPO, were classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded as other expense, into warrants to purchase Class B common stock. As a result, the convertible preferred stock liability was re-measured to its then fair value, which was based on the closing per share price of our Class A common stock on October 4, 2016, and reclassified to additional paid-in capital. Subsequent to the conversion of our convertible preferred stock warrants in connection with our IPO, we no longer remeasure them at fair value or incur any charges related to changes in fair value. In addition, during the three months ended October 31, 2016, we fully repaid our outstanding $75.0 million of senior notes due April 15, 2019, or the senior notes, and incurred a loss on debt extinguishment.\nShifts in the mix of whether our solutions are sold as an appliance or as software-only could result in fluctuations in our revenue and gross margins. Software-only sales typically reflect higher gross margins and lower revenue in a given period, since the sale does not include the revenue or cost of the hardware components in an appliance. When we sell our solution as an appliance, the revenue for the appliance and the basic version of our software included in the appliance is generally recognized upon delivery, whereas revenue from software-only transactions is only recognized upon delivery to the extent we have established vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair value of the related maintenance and support contracts, otherwise revenue for the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized over the term of our maintenance and support contracts. Historically, most of our solutions have been delivered on an appliance, and, as a result, most of our historical product revenue has been recognized upon delivery. However, we anticipate that to the extent that broad market adoption of our solutions continues to increase, there may be an increase in the delivery of our software licenses on separately procured hardware. For additional information on our revenue recognition and VSOE, please see the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section.\nWe calculate our non-GAAP measures as follows:\nNon-GAAP operating expenses-We define non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and the related income tax impact and costs associated with business acquisitions (such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, revaluation of contingent consideration, income tax related impact, and other acquisition-related costs). Our presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nProvision for income taxes \nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the one-year measurement period.\nThe year-over-year increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher foreign taxes as a result of higher taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions as we continued to expand globally.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\n\n\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur end-customers typically deploy our technology for a specific workload initially. After a new end-customer's initial order, which includes the product and associated maintenance, support and services, we focus on expanding our footprint by serving more workloads. We also generate recurring revenue from our support and maintenance renewals. We view continued purchases and upgrades as critical drivers of our success, as the sales cycles are typically shorter compared to new end-customer deployments and selling efforts are typically less. As of July 31, 2017, approximately 74% of our end-customers who have been with us for 18 months or more have made a repeat purchase, which is defined as any purchase activity, including support and maintenance renewals, subsequent to the initial purchase. Additionally, end-customers who have been with us for 18 months or more have total lifetime orders (which includes the initial order) to date in an amount that is more than 4.8x greater, on average, than their initial order. This number increases to approximately 8.1x, on average, for our 559 Global 2000 end-customers and to more than 18.8x, on average, for our top 25 end-customers as of July 31, 2017. The multiples exclude the effect of one end-customer who had a very large and irregular purchase pattern that we believe is not representative of the purchase patterns of all our other end-customers. Our business and operating results will depend on our ability to sell additional products to our current existing and future base of end-customers.\nProduct revenue. We generate our product revenue from the sales of our solutions, delivered both on a hardware appliance as well as software-only. Our revenue from software-only sales, which currently constitute a small portion of our product revenue, is subject to industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance and has typically been deferred and recognized over the contractual support period associated with the delivered software licenses. However, revenue associated with certain software licenses can be recognized upon delivery to our end-customers to the extent we have established VSOE for related support and other services.\nAdjusted gross margin percentage-We calculate adjusted gross margin percentage as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenue. We define adjusted gross profit as our gross profit adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Our presentation of adjusted gross margin percentage should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 are used by management to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational and compensation plans, as well as to assess the extent of achievement of goals. \nNet cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2015 was $25.7 million compared to $3.6 million of net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016. The generation in cash was primarily due to higher billings and collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continued to invest in the longer term growth of our business.\nWe monitor the following key financial and performance metrics:\nIn October 2016, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of Class A common stock, in which we sold 17,100,500 shares, including 2,230,500 shares pursuant to the underwriters' over-allotment option. The shares were sold at an IPO price of $16.00 per share for net proceeds of $254.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $19.2 million. We incurred offering costs of $5.3 million.\nWe regularly monitor billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses, which are non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures, to help us evaluate our growth and operational efficiencies, measure our performance and identify trends in our sales activity, and establish our budgets. We evaluate these measures because they:\nRefer to Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDividend Rate. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use a dividend rate of zero.\nAs of July 31, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses, and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation expense.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet cash used in investing activities of $46.5 million for fiscal 2016 was due to $106.3 million of purchases of investments and $42.3 million of purchases of property and equipment as we continue to invest in the longer term growth of our business, partially offset by $102.1 million of maturities of investments.\nSupport and other services gross margin in fiscal 2016 improved compared to fiscal 2015 as we continued to gain leverage from our support organization. Support and other services gross margin in fiscal 2017 decreased compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense mentioned above.\nRevenue Recognition\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will be effective for us beginning August 1, 2018, and permits us the ability to early adopt on August 1, 2017. The standard permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).\nThe adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of $58.5 million and $79.0 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively, an increase in gross profit of $58.5 million and $79.0 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively, a decrease in sales and marketing expense of $1.9 million in fiscal 2016 and an increase in sales and marketing expense of $0.5 million in fiscal 2017, and a decrease in loss from operations of $60.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $78.5 million in fiscal 2017. In addition, the adoption of the standard will result in a decrease in total net deferred revenue of $78.0 million and $157.0 million as of July 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of software licenses sold with PCS for which we do not have VSOE, and an increase in total deferred commissions of $12.6 million and $12.1 million as of July 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, which will be recognized in sales and marketing expense in future periods. The adoption of the standard will have no significant impact to the provision for income taxes and will have no impact to cash from or used in operating, investing, or financing on our consolidated statements of cash flows. For additional information on the expected impacts to reported results, see Note 2 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBillings-We calculate billings by adding the change in deferred revenue (net of acquisitions) between the start and end of the period to total revenue recognized in the same period.\nNet cash generated from operating activities was $3.6 million and $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. The generation of cash for both fiscal years was primarily due to higher billings and collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continued to invest in the longer term growth of our business. The cash flow generated from fiscal 2017 included $14.4 million of withholdings related to our employee stock purchase plan.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, in a business combination, and is allocated to our single reporting unit. We review our goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful, such as in-process research and development, or IPR&D, for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. We operate under one reporting unit and for our annual goodwill impairment test, we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our enterprise value. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment analysis will be performed. The Company compares the fair value of its reporting unit with its carrying amount and if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.\n\nIncome Taxes\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $201.4 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 was primarily due to net proceeds of $254.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commission from our IPO and $32.3 million net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $76.6 million of repayment of our senior notes including debt extinguishment costs, $7.1 million payment of debt in conjunction with the PernixData acquisition and $1.7 million of payments of IPO costs.\nCost of product revenue. Cost of product revenue consists of costs paid to third-party contract manufacturers, which includes hardware costs, personnel costs (consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation) associated with our operations function and allocated costs (which consist of certain facilities, depreciation and amortization, recruiting, and information technology costs allocated based on headcount). We expect our cost of product revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our product revenue increases.\nCost of Revenue\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe derive revenue from two sources: (i) product revenue, which consists of hardware combined with software and software-only revenue, and (ii) support and service revenue which includes PCS and professional services. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:\nPrior to our IPO, we satisfied our liquidity needs primarily through the sale of convertible preferred stock, senior notes, borrowings from our credit facilities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In October 2016, we completed our IPO of Class A common stock and received net proceeds of $254.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $19.2 million, but before deducting offering costs of $5.3 million. Additionally, in September 2016, we fully repaid the outstanding balance of our senior notes. As of July 31, 2017, we did not have any outstanding borrowings.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe will start amortizing the in-process R&D during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 over a useful life of between 5 to 7 years as the related technology was completed and released in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\n\nOur solution can be delivered either as an appliance that is configured to order or as software only. When end-customers purchase our operating system, they typically also purchase one or more years of support and maintenance in order to receive software upgrades, bug fixes and parts replacement. Product revenue is generated primarily from the sales of our solution, and is generally recognized upon shipment. Support and other services revenue is derived from the related support and maintenance contracts, and is recognized ratably over the term of the support contracts.\nCommissions consist of direct incremental costs paid to our sales force related to customer orders. Commissions are expensed over the same period that revenue is recognized from the related customer order. Deferred commissions are recoverable through the revenue streams that will be recognized under the related orders. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe also intend to continue to grow our research and development and global engineering team to enhance our solutions, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners, and broaden the range of IT infrastructure technologies that we converge into our operating system. We believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may adversely affect our profitability in the near term.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nIPR&D is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the related technology to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nProduct gross margin increased from 60% in fiscal 2015 to 62% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to cost savings achieved from our procurement process, and changes in product mix. Product gross margin decreased from 62% in fiscal 2016 to 57% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in amortization of intangible assets. This was partially offset by cost savings achieved in our procurement process, and changes in product mix. We expect to see continued pressure on the costs of DRAM and NAND as a result of continued supply constraints in fiscal 2018 and we expect these costs to continue to increase so long as the DRAM and NAND markets remain supply constrained.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nAs of July 31, 2017, we had $138.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $210.7 million of short-term investments.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of July 31, 2017:\nSupport and other services revenue. We generate our support and other services revenue primarily from support and maintenance contracts, and, to a lesser extent, from professional services. The majority of our product sales are sold in conjunction with support and maintenance contracts with terms ranging from one to five years. We recognize revenue from support and maintenance contracts over the contractual service period. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.\nInitial Public Offering\nProduct revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. The increase in product revenue reflects increased domestic and international demand for our solution as we continue our penetration and expansion in global markets through increased sales and marketing activities. Our total end-customer count increased from 1,799 as of July 31, 2015 to 3,768 as of July 31, 2016 and to 7,051 as of July 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe increase in cost of product revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the corresponding year-over-year increase in product sales. The increase in cost of product revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was mainly due to the corresponding year-over-year increase in product sales, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million as a result of our IPO, and the $1.3 million amortization of intangible assets related to our business acquisitions in fiscal 2017. Additionally, starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the cost of certain of our hardware components, specifically DRAM and NAND, increased due to supply constraints.\nWe plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing so that we can capitalize on our market opportunity, and as part of this, we intend to specifically expand our focus on opportunities with major accounts and large deals, which we define as transactions over $500,000 in committed value. We have significantly increased our sales and marketing personnel, which grew by 42% from July 31, 2016 to July 31, 2017. We estimate, based on past experience, that sales team members typically become fully ramped around the time of the start of their fourth quarter of employment with us, and as our newer employees ramp up, we expect their increased productivity to contribute to our revenue growth. As of July 31, 2017, we considered 59% of our global sales team members to be fully productive, while the remaining 41% of our global sales team members are in the process of ramping up. As we shift the focus of some of our new and existing sales team members to major accounts and large deals, it may take longer for these sales team members to become fully productive, and there may also be an impact to the overall productivity of our sales team. We are focused on actively managing this realignment, and expect continuing improvement over the coming quarters. We intend to continue to grow our global sales and marketing team to acquire new end-customers and to increase sales to existing end-customers.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated:\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is July 31. Our fiscal quarters end on October 31, January 31, April 30 and July 31. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther expense-net \nNet cash provided by financing activities of $142.8 million for fiscal 2015 primarily consisted of $138.3 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Series E convertible preferred stock and $4.8 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans.\nWe have invested heavily in the growth of our business, including the development of our solutions, build-out of our global sales force and the acquisitions of Calm.io Pte. Ltd., or Calm, and PernixData, Inc., or PernixData, during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The number of our full-time employees increased from 1,980 as of July 31, 2016 to 2,813 as of July 31, 2017. We have recruited an engineering team focused on distributed systems and IT infrastructure technologies at our San Jose, California headquarters and at our research and development centers in Bangalore, India, Durham, North Carolina and Seattle, Washington. We have also expanded our international sales and marketing presence by continuing to build out our global teams. We intend to continue to invest in our global engineering team to enhance the functionality of our operating system, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership, as well as continue to expand our global sales and marketing teams.\nOur total revenue was $444.9 million and $766.9 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 72.4%. Our net losses were $168.5 million and $458.0 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Net cash generated from operations was $3.6 million and $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Free cash flow was an outflow of $38.7 million and $36.4 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. As of July 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $899.8 million.\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the years presented:\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nDelivery has occurred. We typically recognize product revenue upon shipment, when title and risk of loss are transferred to our partners at that time. Service revenue is recognized as services are performed.\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our federal and state net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.\nRevenue\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \nCollectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based on a credit analysis and payment history.\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our board of directors, with input from management, exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each grant date, including but not limited to, (i) contemporaneous valuations of common stock performed by unrelated third-party specialists; (ii) recent private stock sales transactions; (iii) the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; (iv) the lack of marketability of our common stock; (v) developments in the business; (vi) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or a merger or acquisition of our business, given prevailing market conditions; (vii) the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; (viii) our actual operating and financial performance; (ix) U.S. and global capital market conditions; (x) the illiquidity of stock-based awards involving securities in a private company; (xi) our stage of development; and (xii) our history and the timing of the introduction of new products and services.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, which include our executive, finance, human resources and legal organizations. General and administrative expense also includes outside professional services, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and other consulting costs, as well as insurance and other costs associated with being a public company and allocated costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars particularly due to additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs associated with both our growth and operating as a public company, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nPersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We rely on sales agreements and purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement.\nIn April 2016, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million of senior notes due on April 15, 2019 to Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. In September 2016, we repaid the entire outstanding principal amount of the senior notes and incurred $3.3 million of loss on debt extinguishment.\nWe recognize uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.\nThe fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. Payment from partners is not contingent upon the partners receiving payments from end-customers.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\n\n \u2022 are used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our performance and trends as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business; \nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in other expense-net in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $8.2 million of higher charges related to the change in fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2016, partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in interest expense from the issuance of the senior notes in fiscal 2016 and a $1.5 million increase in net foreign currency losses in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nMost of our arrangements are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, support and maintenance and other professional services. Products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting. Hardware deliverables include proprietary software, which together deliver the essential functionality of the products. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: VSOE of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price are available. Other than certain PCS related deliverables, we have not established VSOE of fair value and TPE typically cannot be obtained, therefore we typically allocate consideration to deliverables based on BESP. Our process to determine VSOE is based upon the evaluation of normal pricing and discount practices on deliverables when they are sold separately. Our process to determine BESP for our products and services is based on qualitative and quantitative considerations of multiple factors, which primarily include historical sales, margin objectives and discount behavior. Additional considerations are given to other factors such as customer demographics, costs to manufacture products or provide services, pricing practices and market conditions.\nAs discussed above, we have previously granted performance stock awards with vesting subject to satisfaction of one or more performance conditions, including a liquidity event condition tied to our IPO. Certain of those performance stock awards began to vest during the three months ending April 30, 2017, and, subject to the terms of the underlying awards, will continue to vest periodically thereafter. In February 2017, we changed the method by which withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of such performance stock awards held by our executive officers would be covered to be consistent with that of the rest of our employee population. As a result, in addition to our general employee population being required to sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon vesting of their performance stock awards in order to cover any required withholding taxes, or sell-to-cover, our executive officers will now also be required to fund any withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of their performance stock awards through a sell-to-cover, as opposed to our previous approach of retaining a number of shares with a value equal to the amount of the tax and remitting cash to the appropriate taxing authorities, or net share settlement. The sell-to-cover approach allows us to avoid the large cash outflows that would have otherwise been required to satisfy withholding tax obligations resulting from the vesting of performance stock awards, including those held by our executive officers, under the net share settlement approach. In addition, as compared to the net share settlement approach, sell-to-cover will result in more shares being issued into the market as employees' performance stock awards vest, thereby increasing the dilutive impact of our share-based compensation programs on shareholders.\nBillings is a performance measure which our management believes provides useful information to investors because it represents the amounts under binding purchase orders received by us during a given period that have been billed. Free cash flow is a performance measure that our management believes provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash (used in) generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. We use these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures such as stock-based compensation expense that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. Billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses are not substitutes for total revenue, gross margin percentage, cash (used in) provided by operating activities, or GAAP operating expenses, respectively. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. We urge you to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nOur results of operations for fiscal 2017 include (i) stock-based compensation related to stock awards with performance conditions, referred to as the performance stock awards, due to our IPO and (ii) the impact of the Calm and PernixData acquisitions, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. No expense associated with the performance stock awards was recorded prior to our IPO, as the qualifying event (IPO) had not been deemed probable (see Note 11 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Beginning in fiscal 2014, we began granting performance stock awards with vesting subject to (i) continuous service with us and (ii) satisfaction of one or more performance conditions (a liquidity event or both a liquidity event and certain performance targets). As a result of our IPO, we began to recognize stock-based compensation expense related to the performance stock awards during the three months ended October 31, 2016 as the performance condition, a liquidity event or IPO, was deemed probable of achievement.\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards including stock options and purchase rights issued to employees under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, based on estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. We use Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of a stock option and ESPP purchase rights. The fair value of a restricted stock unit, or RSU, is measured using the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock options and RSUs is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally four years. For stock-based awards granted to employees with a performance condition, we recognize stock-based compensation expense for these awards under the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period when management determines it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. The fair value of the ESPP purchase rights is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\n (3) Represents $7.5 million contingent payments, net of $1.8 million working capital adjustment, assumed in the PernixData acquisition. The amount is remeasured at fair value every reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in general and administrative expenses (see Note 3 and Note 4, of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The actual amount ultimately paid out may be different depending on the level of achievement of certain operating milestones.  As of July 31, 2017, payments related to our above outstanding non-cancellable lease obligations will be made through fiscal 2024.\nResearch and development expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2016 and 2017 primarily due to higher personnel costs as our research and development headcount increased year-over-year by 59% in fiscal 2016 and 40% (inclusive of the additional headcount from the PernixData and Calm acquisitions) in fiscal 2017, as we have continued the expansion of our product development activities. The year-over-year increase in fiscal 2017 in research and development personnel costs includes a $102.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $74.2 million for fiscal 2016 primarily consisted of $73.3 million of net proceeds from the senior notes and $3.1 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $3.2 million in payments of IPO costs.\nWe believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. See the section titled Risk Factors\u201d. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nChanges in Product Mix and Associated Accounting Impact\n (2) Commitments with our contract manufacturers, which consist of obligations for on-hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders for certain components. \n (1) Purchase obligations pertaining to our normal operations. \nTo date, we have not recorded any impairment charges related to our goodwill and intangible assets. However, deteriorating market conditions or any future events that negatively impact our business may result in an impairment charge.\nResearch and development \n\nKey Financial and Performance Metrics\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures\nCost of product revenue\nContinued Purchases and Upgrades within Existing Customer Base\nComponents of Our Results of Operations", "item_7_text": "Total revenue by bill-to-location was as follows: \nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. To determine the expected term, we generally apply the simplified approach in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date of the award as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis for an estimate of expected term.\n \u2022 are widely used by investors and other parties in understanding and evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance; and \nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nCost of support and other services revenue. Cost of support and other services revenue includes personnel and operating costs associated with our global customer support organization as well as allocated costs. We expect our cost of support and other services revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our support and other services revenue increases.\nSales and marketing expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2016 and 2017 primarily due to higher personnel costs and sales commissions, as our sales and marketing headcount increased year-over-year by 70% in fiscal 2016 and 42% in fiscal 2017. The year-over-year increase in fiscal 2017 in sales and marketing personnel costs includes a $70.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO. Additionally, as part of our efforts to penetrate and expand in global markets, we have continually increased our marketing activities related to brand awareness, promotions, trade shows and partner programs.\nOther Income (Expense)-net\nResearch and development. Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel costs, as well as other direct and allocated costs. We have devoted our product development efforts primarily to enhancing the functionality and expanding the capabilities of our solutions. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nWe plan to continue to strengthen and expand our network of channel and OEM partners to increase sales to both new and existing end-customers. We believe that increasing channel leverage by investing aggressively in sales enablement and co-marketing with our partners will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of end-customers. Our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by our success in leveraging and expanding our network of channel and OEM partners.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $106.7 million for fiscal 2015 was due to $116.1 million of purchases of investments and $23.3 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $32.8 million of maturities of investments.\nSupport and other services revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 in conjunction with the growth of our established base of end-customers with support and software maintenance contracts.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expense also includes sales commissions, costs for promotional activities and other marketing costs, travel costs, and costs associated with demonstration units, including depreciation and allocated costs. Commissions are deferred and recognized as we recognize the associated revenue. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our global sales and marketing organizations. Our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nFree cash flow-We calculate free cash flow as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities adjusted with purchases of property and equipment, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations after our capital expenditures.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2016 and 2017 primarily due to higher personnel costs as our general and administrative headcount increased year-over-year by 51% in fiscal 2016 and 24% in fiscal 2017 in order to support our growing operations and international footprint, as well as costs associated with being a public company. The year-over-year increase in fiscal 2017 in general and administrative personnel costs includes a $26.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO.\nExpected Volatility. As we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option awards. Industry peers consist of several public companies in our industry which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle or financial leverage and were the same as the comparable companies used in the common stock valuation analyses.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $176.1 million for fiscal 2017 was due to $242.5 million of purchases of investments using a significant portion of the proceeds from our IPO and $50.2 million of purchases of property and equipment as we continue to invest in the longer term growth of our business, partially offset by $84.2 million of maturities and $32.6 million of sales of investments.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDebt Obligations\nGeneral and administrative \nThe year-over-year increase in other expense-net in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to $23.1 million of higher charges resulting from changes in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability and $3.3 million loss on debt extinguishment resulting from early extinguishment of our senior notes.\nAs of July 31, 2017, we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.\nOperating Expenses\nOverview\nWe account for our acquisitions using the acquisition method. Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities. Although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities obtained during the measurement period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of such assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe increase in cost of support and other services revenue was primarily due to higher personnel costs of our global customer support organization, as our customer support and services headcount increased in order to support our growing end-customer base.\nWe provide a leading next-generation enterprise cloud operating system that converges traditional silos of server, virtualization, storage and networking into one integrated solution and unifies private and public cloud into a single software fabric. Our software delivers the agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of the public cloud, while addressing enterprise requirements of application mobility, security, data integrity and control. We provide our customers with the flexibility to selectively utilize the public cloud for suitable workloads and specific use cases by enabling increasing levels of application mobility across private and public clouds. We have combined advanced web-scale technologies with elegant consumer-grade design to deliver a powerful enterprise cloud operating system that elevates IT organizations by enabling them to focus on the applications and services that power their businesses. Our invisible infrastructure provides constant availability and low-touch management, enables application mobility across computing environments and reduces inefficiencies in IT planning.\n\nSales and marketing\nFrom time to time, we make commitments with our contract manufacturer, which consist of obligations for on-hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders for non-standard components. We record a charge to cost of product sales for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with the contract manufacturers for non-standard components when and if quantities exceed our future demand forecasts. Our historical charges have not been material.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCost of support and other services revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2016 and 2017 primarily due to higher personnel costs from our global customer support organization, resulting from increases in our customer support and services headcount of 113% from July 31, 2015 to July 31, 2016 and 62% from July 31, 2016 to July 31, 2017. The increase in cost of support and other services revenue in fiscal 2017 was also driven by a $9.4 million year-over-year increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO.\nMarket Adoption of Our Products\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.\nRevenue\nCost of support and other services revenue\nThe year-over-year increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to increases in foreign taxes as a result of higher taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions as we continued our global expansion, partially offset by a $1.5 million partial release of the U.S. valuation allowance from the PernixData acquisition. The net deferred tax liability from the PernixData acquisition provided an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of the pre-existing deferred tax assets and, as a result, we released a portion of the U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance. We continue to maintain full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.\nResults of Operations\nBusiness Combinations\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessment\nThe public cloud has changed IT buyer expectations about the simplicity, agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of IT resources, which represent a major architectural shift and business model evolution. A key focus of our sales and marketing efforts is creating market awareness about the benefits of our operating system, both as compared to traditional data center architectures as well as the public cloud, particularly as we continue to pursue large enterprises and mission critical workloads. The broad nature of the technology shift that our operating system represents and the relationships our end-customers have with existing IT vendors sometimes lead to unpredictable sales cycles, which we hope to compress and stabilize as market adoption increases, as we gain leverage with our channel partners and as our sales and marketing efforts expand. Our business and operating results will be significantly affected by the degree to and speed with which organizations adopt our operating system.\nThe new standard would have been effective for us beginning in August 1, 2018, however, we elected to early adopt the standard effective August 1, 2017 using the full retrospective method, which requires us to restate our historical financial information for fiscal 2016 and 2017 to be consistent with the standard. The most significant impact of the standard relates to the timing of revenue recognition for certain software licenses sold with post contract support, or PCS, for which we do not have VSOE under current guidance. Under the new standard the requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements is eliminated and we will recognize revenue for such software licenses upon transfer of control to our customers. In addition, the adoption of ASC 606 will also result in differences in the timing of recognition of contract costs, such as sales commissions, as well as the corresponding impacts to provision for income taxes.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities approximately equal to the term of employee stock option awards.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLeveraging Channel and OEM Partners\nCommissions\nInvestment in Growth\nCash Flows\nSubsequent to our IPO, we use the market closing price for our Class A common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant.\n\n(2) Includes amortization of intangible assets as follows:\nWe had a broad and diverse base of 7,051 end-customers as of July 31, 2017, including approximately 559 Global 2000 enterprises. Since shipping our first product in fiscal 2012, our end-customer base has grown rapidly. The number of end-customers grew from 3,768 as of July 31, 2016 to 7,051 as of July 31, 2017. Our operating system is primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors and resellers, and delivered directly to our end-customers. A major part of our sales and marketing investment is to educate our end-customers about the benefits of our solution, particularly as we continue to pursue large enterprises and mission critical workloads. Our solutions serve a broad range of workloads, including enterprise applications, databases, virtual desktop infrastructure, or VDI, unified communications and big data analytics and we have recently announced the capability to support both virtualized and non-virtualized applications. We have end-customers across a broad range of industries, such as automotive, consumer goods, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media, public sector, retail, technology and telecommunications. We also sell to service providers, who utilize our operating system to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nOther income (expense)-net consists primarily of interest income and expense, foreign exchange gains or losses and gains or losses on investments. Upon the completion of our IPO, we reclassified the convertible preferred stock warrants, which, prior to our IPO, were classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded as other expense, into warrants to purchase Class B common stock. As a result, the convertible preferred stock liability was re-measured to its then fair value, which was based on the closing per share price of our Class A common stock on October 4, 2016, and reclassified to additional paid-in capital. Subsequent to the conversion of our convertible preferred stock warrants in connection with our IPO, we no longer remeasure them at fair value or incur any charges related to changes in fair value. In addition, during the three months ended October 31, 2016, we fully repaid our outstanding $75.0 million of senior notes due April 15, 2019, or the senior notes, and incurred a loss on debt extinguishment.\nShifts in the mix of whether our solutions are sold as an appliance or as software-only could result in fluctuations in our revenue and gross margins. Software-only sales typically reflect higher gross margins and lower revenue in a given period, since the sale does not include the revenue or cost of the hardware components in an appliance. When we sell our solution as an appliance, the revenue for the appliance and the basic version of our software included in the appliance is generally recognized upon delivery, whereas revenue from software-only transactions is only recognized upon delivery to the extent we have established vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair value of the related maintenance and support contracts, otherwise revenue for the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized over the term of our maintenance and support contracts. Historically, most of our solutions have been delivered on an appliance, and, as a result, most of our historical product revenue has been recognized upon delivery. However, we anticipate that to the extent that broad market adoption of our solutions continues to increase, there may be an increase in the delivery of our software licenses on separately procured hardware. For additional information on our revenue recognition and VSOE, please see the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section.\nWe calculate our non-GAAP measures as follows:\nNon-GAAP operating expenses-We define non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and the related income tax impact and costs associated with business acquisitions (such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, revaluation of contingent consideration, income tax related impact, and other acquisition-related costs). Our presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nProvision for income taxes \nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the one-year measurement period.\nThe year-over-year increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher foreign taxes as a result of higher taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions as we continued to expand globally.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\n\n\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur end-customers typically deploy our technology for a specific workload initially. After a new end-customer's initial order, which includes the product and associated maintenance, support and services, we focus on expanding our footprint by serving more workloads. We also generate recurring revenue from our support and maintenance renewals. We view continued purchases and upgrades as critical drivers of our success, as the sales cycles are typically shorter compared to new end-customer deployments and selling efforts are typically less. As of July 31, 2017, approximately 74% of our end-customers who have been with us for 18 months or more have made a repeat purchase, which is defined as any purchase activity, including support and maintenance renewals, subsequent to the initial purchase. Additionally, end-customers who have been with us for 18 months or more have total lifetime orders (which includes the initial order) to date in an amount that is more than 4.8x greater, on average, than their initial order. This number increases to approximately 8.1x, on average, for our 559 Global 2000 end-customers and to more than 18.8x, on average, for our top 25 end-customers as of July 31, 2017. The multiples exclude the effect of one end-customer who had a very large and irregular purchase pattern that we believe is not representative of the purchase patterns of all our other end-customers. Our business and operating results will depend on our ability to sell additional products to our current existing and future base of end-customers.\nProduct revenue. We generate our product revenue from the sales of our solutions, delivered both on a hardware appliance as well as software-only. Our revenue from software-only sales, which currently constitute a small portion of our product revenue, is subject to industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance and has typically been deferred and recognized over the contractual support period associated with the delivered software licenses. However, revenue associated with certain software licenses can be recognized upon delivery to our end-customers to the extent we have established VSOE for related support and other services.\nAdjusted gross margin percentage-We calculate adjusted gross margin percentage as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenue. We define adjusted gross profit as our gross profit adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Our presentation of adjusted gross margin percentage should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 are used by management to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational and compensation plans, as well as to assess the extent of achievement of goals. \nNet cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2015 was $25.7 million compared to $3.6 million of net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016. The generation in cash was primarily due to higher billings and collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continued to invest in the longer term growth of our business.\nWe monitor the following key financial and performance metrics:\nIn October 2016, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of Class A common stock, in which we sold 17,100,500 shares, including 2,230,500 shares pursuant to the underwriters' over-allotment option. The shares were sold at an IPO price of $16.00 per share for net proceeds of $254.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $19.2 million. We incurred offering costs of $5.3 million.\nWe regularly monitor billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses, which are non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures, to help us evaluate our growth and operational efficiencies, measure our performance and identify trends in our sales activity, and establish our budgets. We evaluate these measures because they:\nRefer to Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDividend Rate. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use a dividend rate of zero.\nAs of July 31, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses, and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation expense.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet cash used in investing activities of $46.5 million for fiscal 2016 was due to $106.3 million of purchases of investments and $42.3 million of purchases of property and equipment as we continue to invest in the longer term growth of our business, partially offset by $102.1 million of maturities of investments.\nSupport and other services gross margin in fiscal 2016 improved compared to fiscal 2015 as we continued to gain leverage from our support organization. Support and other services gross margin in fiscal 2017 decreased compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense mentioned above.\nRevenue Recognition\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will be effective for us beginning August 1, 2018, and permits us the ability to early adopt on August 1, 2017. The standard permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).\nThe adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of $58.5 million and $79.0 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively, an increase in gross profit of $58.5 million and $79.0 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively, a decrease in sales and marketing expense of $1.9 million in fiscal 2016 and an increase in sales and marketing expense of $0.5 million in fiscal 2017, and a decrease in loss from operations of $60.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $78.5 million in fiscal 2017. In addition, the adoption of the standard will result in a decrease in total net deferred revenue of $78.0 million and $157.0 million as of July 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of software licenses sold with PCS for which we do not have VSOE, and an increase in total deferred commissions of $12.6 million and $12.1 million as of July 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, which will be recognized in sales and marketing expense in future periods. The adoption of the standard will have no significant impact to the provision for income taxes and will have no impact to cash from or used in operating, investing, or financing on our consolidated statements of cash flows. For additional information on the expected impacts to reported results, see Note 2 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBillings-We calculate billings by adding the change in deferred revenue (net of acquisitions) between the start and end of the period to total revenue recognized in the same period.\nNet cash generated from operating activities was $3.6 million and $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. The generation of cash for both fiscal years was primarily due to higher billings and collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continued to invest in the longer term growth of our business. The cash flow generated from fiscal 2017 included $14.4 million of withholdings related to our employee stock purchase plan.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, in a business combination, and is allocated to our single reporting unit. We review our goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful, such as in-process research and development, or IPR&D, for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. We operate under one reporting unit and for our annual goodwill impairment test, we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our enterprise value. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment analysis will be performed. The Company compares the fair value of its reporting unit with its carrying amount and if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.\n\nIncome Taxes\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $201.4 million for the year ended July 31, 2017 was primarily due to net proceeds of $254.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commission from our IPO and $32.3 million net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $76.6 million of repayment of our senior notes including debt extinguishment costs, $7.1 million payment of debt in conjunction with the PernixData acquisition and $1.7 million of payments of IPO costs.\nCost of product revenue. Cost of product revenue consists of costs paid to third-party contract manufacturers, which includes hardware costs, personnel costs (consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation) associated with our operations function and allocated costs (which consist of certain facilities, depreciation and amortization, recruiting, and information technology costs allocated based on headcount). We expect our cost of product revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our product revenue increases.\nCost of Revenue\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe derive revenue from two sources: (i) product revenue, which consists of hardware combined with software and software-only revenue, and (ii) support and service revenue which includes PCS and professional services. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:\nPrior to our IPO, we satisfied our liquidity needs primarily through the sale of convertible preferred stock, senior notes, borrowings from our credit facilities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In October 2016, we completed our IPO of Class A common stock and received net proceeds of $254.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $19.2 million, but before deducting offering costs of $5.3 million. Additionally, in September 2016, we fully repaid the outstanding balance of our senior notes. As of July 31, 2017, we did not have any outstanding borrowings.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe will start amortizing the in-process R&D during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 over a useful life of between 5 to 7 years as the related technology was completed and released in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\n\nOur solution can be delivered either as an appliance that is configured to order or as software only. When end-customers purchase our operating system, they typically also purchase one or more years of support and maintenance in order to receive software upgrades, bug fixes and parts replacement. Product revenue is generated primarily from the sales of our solution, and is generally recognized upon shipment. Support and other services revenue is derived from the related support and maintenance contracts, and is recognized ratably over the term of the support contracts.\nCommissions consist of direct incremental costs paid to our sales force related to customer orders. Commissions are expensed over the same period that revenue is recognized from the related customer order. Deferred commissions are recoverable through the revenue streams that will be recognized under the related orders. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe also intend to continue to grow our research and development and global engineering team to enhance our solutions, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners, and broaden the range of IT infrastructure technologies that we converge into our operating system. We believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may adversely affect our profitability in the near term.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nIPR&D is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the related technology to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nProduct gross margin increased from 60% in fiscal 2015 to 62% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to cost savings achieved from our procurement process, and changes in product mix. Product gross margin decreased from 62% in fiscal 2016 to 57% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in amortization of intangible assets. This was partially offset by cost savings achieved in our procurement process, and changes in product mix. We expect to see continued pressure on the costs of DRAM and NAND as a result of continued supply constraints in fiscal 2018 and we expect these costs to continue to increase so long as the DRAM and NAND markets remain supply constrained.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nAs of July 31, 2017, we had $138.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $210.7 million of short-term investments.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of July 31, 2017:\nSupport and other services revenue. We generate our support and other services revenue primarily from support and maintenance contracts, and, to a lesser extent, from professional services. The majority of our product sales are sold in conjunction with support and maintenance contracts with terms ranging from one to five years. We recognize revenue from support and maintenance contracts over the contractual service period. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.\nInitial Public Offering\nProduct revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. The increase in product revenue reflects increased domestic and international demand for our solution as we continue our penetration and expansion in global markets through increased sales and marketing activities. Our total end-customer count increased from 1,799 as of July 31, 2015 to 3,768 as of July 31, 2016 and to 7,051 as of July 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe increase in cost of product revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the corresponding year-over-year increase in product sales. The increase in cost of product revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was mainly due to the corresponding year-over-year increase in product sales, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million as a result of our IPO, and the $1.3 million amortization of intangible assets related to our business acquisitions in fiscal 2017. Additionally, starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the cost of certain of our hardware components, specifically DRAM and NAND, increased due to supply constraints.\nWe plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing so that we can capitalize on our market opportunity, and as part of this, we intend to specifically expand our focus on opportunities with major accounts and large deals, which we define as transactions over $500,000 in committed value. We have significantly increased our sales and marketing personnel, which grew by 42% from July 31, 2016 to July 31, 2017. We estimate, based on past experience, that sales team members typically become fully ramped around the time of the start of their fourth quarter of employment with us, and as our newer employees ramp up, we expect their increased productivity to contribute to our revenue growth. As of July 31, 2017, we considered 59% of our global sales team members to be fully productive, while the remaining 41% of our global sales team members are in the process of ramping up. As we shift the focus of some of our new and existing sales team members to major accounts and large deals, it may take longer for these sales team members to become fully productive, and there may also be an impact to the overall productivity of our sales team. We are focused on actively managing this realignment, and expect continuing improvement over the coming quarters. We intend to continue to grow our global sales and marketing team to acquire new end-customers and to increase sales to existing end-customers.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated:\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is July 31. Our fiscal quarters end on October 31, January 31, April 30 and July 31. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther expense-net \nNet cash provided by financing activities of $142.8 million for fiscal 2015 primarily consisted of $138.3 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Series E convertible preferred stock and $4.8 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans.\nWe have invested heavily in the growth of our business, including the development of our solutions, build-out of our global sales force and the acquisitions of Calm.io Pte. Ltd., or Calm, and PernixData, Inc., or PernixData, during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The number of our full-time employees increased from 1,980 as of July 31, 2016 to 2,813 as of July 31, 2017. We have recruited an engineering team focused on distributed systems and IT infrastructure technologies at our San Jose, California headquarters and at our research and development centers in Bangalore, India, Durham, North Carolina and Seattle, Washington. We have also expanded our international sales and marketing presence by continuing to build out our global teams. We intend to continue to invest in our global engineering team to enhance the functionality of our operating system, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership, as well as continue to expand our global sales and marketing teams.\nOur total revenue was $444.9 million and $766.9 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 72.4%. Our net losses were $168.5 million and $458.0 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Net cash generated from operations was $3.6 million and $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Free cash flow was an outflow of $38.7 million and $36.4 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively. As of July 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $899.8 million.\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the years presented:\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nDelivery has occurred. We typically recognize product revenue upon shipment, when title and risk of loss are transferred to our partners at that time. Service revenue is recognized as services are performed.\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our federal and state net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.\nRevenue\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \nCollectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based on a credit analysis and payment history.\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our board of directors, with input from management, exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each grant date, including but not limited to, (i) contemporaneous valuations of common stock performed by unrelated third-party specialists; (ii) recent private stock sales transactions; (iii) the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; (iv) the lack of marketability of our common stock; (v) developments in the business; (vi) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or a merger or acquisition of our business, given prevailing market conditions; (vii) the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; (viii) our actual operating and financial performance; (ix) U.S. and global capital market conditions; (x) the illiquidity of stock-based awards involving securities in a private company; (xi) our stage of development; and (xii) our history and the timing of the introduction of new products and services.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, which include our executive, finance, human resources and legal organizations. General and administrative expense also includes outside professional services, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and other consulting costs, as well as insurance and other costs associated with being a public company and allocated costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars particularly due to additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs associated with both our growth and operating as a public company, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nPersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We rely on sales agreements and purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement.\nIn April 2016, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million of senior notes due on April 15, 2019 to Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. In September 2016, we repaid the entire outstanding principal amount of the senior notes and incurred $3.3 million of loss on debt extinguishment.\nWe recognize uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.\nThe fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. Payment from partners is not contingent upon the partners receiving payments from end-customers.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\n\n \u2022 are used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our performance and trends as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business; \nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in other expense-net in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $8.2 million of higher charges related to the change in fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2016, partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in interest expense from the issuance of the senior notes in fiscal 2016 and a $1.5 million increase in net foreign currency losses in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nMost of our arrangements are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, support and maintenance and other professional services. Products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting. Hardware deliverables include proprietary software, which together deliver the essential functionality of the products. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: VSOE of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price are available. Other than certain PCS related deliverables, we have not established VSOE of fair value and TPE typically cannot be obtained, therefore we typically allocate consideration to deliverables based on BESP. Our process to determine VSOE is based upon the evaluation of normal pricing and discount practices on deliverables when they are sold separately. Our process to determine BESP for our products and services is based on qualitative and quantitative considerations of multiple factors, which primarily include historical sales, margin objectives and discount behavior. Additional considerations are given to other factors such as customer demographics, costs to manufacture products or provide services, pricing practices and market conditions.\nAs discussed above, we have previously granted performance stock awards with vesting subject to satisfaction of one or more performance conditions, including a liquidity event condition tied to our IPO. Certain of those performance stock awards began to vest during the three months ending April 30, 2017, and, subject to the terms of the underlying awards, will continue to vest periodically thereafter. In February 2017, we changed the method by which withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of such performance stock awards held by our executive officers would be covered to be consistent with that of the rest of our employee population. As a result, in addition to our general employee population being required to sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon vesting of their performance stock awards in order to cover any required withholding taxes, or sell-to-cover, our executive officers will now also be required to fund any withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of their performance stock awards through a sell-to-cover, as opposed to our previous approach of retaining a number of shares with a value equal to the amount of the tax and remitting cash to the appropriate taxing authorities, or net share settlement. The sell-to-cover approach allows us to avoid the large cash outflows that would have otherwise been required to satisfy withholding tax obligations resulting from the vesting of performance stock awards, including those held by our executive officers, under the net share settlement approach. In addition, as compared to the net share settlement approach, sell-to-cover will result in more shares being issued into the market as employees' performance stock awards vest, thereby increasing the dilutive impact of our share-based compensation programs on shareholders.\nBillings is a performance measure which our management believes provides useful information to investors because it represents the amounts under binding purchase orders received by us during a given period that have been billed. Free cash flow is a performance measure that our management believes provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash (used in) generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. We use these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures such as stock-based compensation expense that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. Billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Billings, adjusted gross margin percentage, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses are not substitutes for total revenue, gross margin percentage, cash (used in) provided by operating activities, or GAAP operating expenses, respectively. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. We urge you to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nOur results of operations for fiscal 2017 include (i) stock-based compensation related to stock awards with performance conditions, referred to as the performance stock awards, due to our IPO and (ii) the impact of the Calm and PernixData acquisitions, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. No expense associated with the performance stock awards was recorded prior to our IPO, as the qualifying event (IPO) had not been deemed probable (see Note 11 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Beginning in fiscal 2014, we began granting performance stock awards with vesting subject to (i) continuous service with us and (ii) satisfaction of one or more performance conditions (a liquidity event or both a liquidity event and certain performance targets). As a result of our IPO, we began to recognize stock-based compensation expense related to the performance stock awards during the three months ended October 31, 2016 as the performance condition, a liquidity event or IPO, was deemed probable of achievement.\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards including stock options and purchase rights issued to employees under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, based on estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. We use Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of a stock option and ESPP purchase rights. The fair value of a restricted stock unit, or RSU, is measured using the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock options and RSUs is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally four years. For stock-based awards granted to employees with a performance condition, we recognize stock-based compensation expense for these awards under the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period when management determines it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. The fair value of the ESPP purchase rights is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\n (3) Represents $7.5 million contingent payments, net of $1.8 million working capital adjustment, assumed in the PernixData acquisition. The amount is remeasured at fair value every reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in general and administrative expenses (see Note 3 and Note 4, of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The actual amount ultimately paid out may be different depending on the level of achievement of certain operating milestones.  As of July 31, 2017, payments related to our above outstanding non-cancellable lease obligations will be made through fiscal 2024.\nResearch and development expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2016 and 2017 primarily due to higher personnel costs as our research and development headcount increased year-over-year by 59% in fiscal 2016 and 40% (inclusive of the additional headcount from the PernixData and Calm acquisitions) in fiscal 2017, as we have continued the expansion of our product development activities. The year-over-year increase in fiscal 2017 in research and development personnel costs includes a $102.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $74.2 million for fiscal 2016 primarily consisted of $73.3 million of net proceeds from the senior notes and $3.1 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $3.2 million in payments of IPO costs.\nWe believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. See the section titled Risk Factors\u201d. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nChanges in Product Mix and Associated Accounting Impact\n (2) Commitments with our contract manufacturers, which consist of obligations for on-hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders for certain components. \n (1) Purchase obligations pertaining to our normal operations. \nTo date, we have not recorded any impairment charges related to our goodwill and intangible assets. However, deteriorating market conditions or any future events that negatively impact our business may result in an impairment charge.\nResearch and development \n\nKey Financial and Performance

Decrease in 2017 was due to increase in stock-based compensation and supply constraints. \n- Support and other services gross margin improved in fiscal 2016 but decreased in fiscal 2017 due to higher stock-based compensation.\n\nOperating Expenses\n- Increased in both fiscal 2016 and 2017, mainly driven by higher personnel costs as headcount grew to support product development and sales expansion. Also due to IPO-related stock-based compensation in fiscal 2017.  \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Completed IPO in October 2016, receiving $254.5 million in net proceeds.
