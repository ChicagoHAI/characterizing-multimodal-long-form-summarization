MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral Overview\nOur principal business is residential homebuilding and the development of lifestyle communities with operations geographically focused in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, and Texas. We serve a wide array of consumer groups from coast to coast, including first time, move-up, luxury, and active adult buyers, building single family attached and detached homes. Our homebuilding company operates under our Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes brand names. We also have operations which provide mortgage services to customers through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, Taylor Morrison Home Funding ( TMHF\u201d), and title services through our wholly owned title services subsidiary, Inspired Title Services, LLC ( Inspired Title\u201d). Our business is organized into multiple homebuilding operating components, and a mortgage operations component, all of which are managed as four reportable segments: East, Central, West and Mortgage Operations, as follows:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Orlando, Raleigh, Southwest Florida, and Tampa\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Austin, Dallas, Denver, and Houston\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Bay Area, Phoenix, Sacramento, and Southern California\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TMHF and Inspired Title\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we realigned our homebuilding operating divisions within our existing segments based on geographic location and management's long term strategic plans, however our reporting segments remained unchanged. As a result, all historical periods presented in the segment information have been reclassified to give effect to this segment realignment.\n2017 Highlights and Recent Developments\nOur financial and operational highlights for the year ended December 31, 2017 and recent developments subsequent to the year end are summarized below:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Since January 2017, we have completed seven public offerings for an aggregate of 80.2 million shares of our Class A Common Stock, using all of the net proceeds therefrom to repurchase our Principal Equityholders' indirect interest in TMHC.

While we were encouraged by certain positive and improved trends during 2017, several challenges still exist, such as lingering under employment concerns, stagnation in real wages and real or perceived personal wealth, national and global economic uncertainty and uncertainty around the interest rate environment. We are additionally challenged by shortages in the labor supply, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, and volatility in energy prices. Nevertheless, we believe we are in an upward business cycle.\nOur approach in allocating capital and managing our land portfolio has been to acquire assets that have attractive characteristics, including good access to schools, shopping, recreation and transportation facilities. In connection with our overall land inventory management process, our management team reviews these considerations, as well as other financial metrics, in order to decide the highest and best use of our capital.\nWe intend to maintain a consistent approach to land positioning within our regions, markets and communities in the foreseeable future in an effort to concentrate a greater amount of our land inventory in attractive areas. We also intend to continue to combine our land development expertise with our homebuilding operations to increase the flexibility of our business and to optimize our margin performance. From time to time, we may sell land in our communities if we believe it is best for our overall operations. We do not expect such sales to have a significant effect on our overall results, but they may impact our overall gross margins.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Results\nThe Management's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The primary factors that affect the comparability of our results of operations are the impacts of the Tax Act, our acquisitions, and disposal activities.\nDuring 2017, tax legislation was enacted which made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a mandatory deemed repatriation tax of foreign earnings at a reduced rate, that may be payable over eight years. Our effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2017 includes one-time tax expense charges to account for the lower tax rate impact to our existing deferred tax assets and the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015. In 2018, we expect to have a lower annual effective tax rate due to the reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate.\nDisposal activities consist of the disposal of Monarch Corporation, our former Canadian business ( Monarch\u201d), and gain on foreign currency hedge in January 2015, loss on extinguishment of debt and the acquisition of JEH Homes (\"JEH\") in the second quarter of 2015, the acquisition of three divisions of Orleans Homes (\"Orleans\") in the third quarter of 2015, and the acquisition of Acadia Homes (\"Acadia\") in January 2016. For all periods presented, the operating results of Monarch are included in discontinued operations and historical periods have been recast to show the effects of our segment realignment, which was effective December 31, 2015. In addition to the impact of the matters discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A of this Annual Report, our future results could differ materially from our historical results due to these changes.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), we have provided information in this Annual Report relating to as adjusted net income from continuing operations,\u201d as adjusted earnings per common share,\u201d as adjusted income tax provision,\u201d as adjusted effective tax rate,\u201d and net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio.\u201d\nWe calculate as adjusted net income from continuing operations from U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations by adding the tax reform impact due to the revaluation of deferred assets and liabilities and mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. Such expenses only occurred for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the Tax Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017. As adjusted earnings per common share utilizes the as adjusted net income from continuing operations measure within the numerator of the earnings per share calculation. As adjusted income tax provision and As adjusted effective tax rate reflect our income tax provision adjusted to exclude the impact of tax reform. We calculate net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio by dividing (i) total debt, less unamortized debt issuance costs and mortgage warehouse borrowings, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, by (ii) total capitalization (the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders' equity). Management uses all of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operational and economic performance and to set targets for performance-based compensation on a consolidated basis to compare to prior years which did not include such significant tax reform. We also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry. We believe as adjusted net income from continuing operations, as adjusted earnings per common share, as adjusted income tax provision and as adjusted effective tax rate are relevant and useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the performance of our operations without the significant effect of the Tax Act. Because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry, we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason. These measures are considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The significant accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are critical accounting policies and are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nHome closings revenue is recorded using the completed-contract method of accounting at the time each home is delivered, title and possession are transferred to the buyer, we have no significant continuing involvement with the home, risk of loss has transferred, the buyer has demonstrated sufficient investment in the property, and the receivable, if any, from the homeowner or escrow agent is not subject to future subordination.\nWe typically grant our homebuyers certain sales incentives, including cash discounts, incentives on options included in the home, option upgrades, and seller-paid financing or closing costs. Incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction in the sales price of the home, and home closings revenue is shown net of discounts. We also receive rebates from certain vendors and these rebates are accounted for as a reduction to cost of home closings.\nLand closings revenue is recognized when title is transferred to the buyer, we have no significant continuing involvement, the buyer has demonstrated sufficient investment in the property sold and the receivable, if any, from the buyer is not subject to future subordination. If the buyer has not made an adequate investment in the property, the profit on such sale is deferred until these conditions are met.\nMortgage Operations Revenue\nLoan origination fees (including title fees, points, and closing costs) are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. All of the loans TMHF originates are sold to third party investors within a short period of time (typically within 15-20 business days) on a non-recourse basis. Gains and losses from the sale of mortgages are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 860-20, Sales of Financial Assets.\u201d Because TMHF does not have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, we derecognize the mortgage loans at time of sale, based on the difference between the selling price and carrying value of the related loans upon sale, recording a gain/loss on sale in the period of sale. Also, we enter into IRLCs to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time. These instruments meet the definition of a derivative and the realized and unrealized gain and loss from the IRLCs are included in mortgage operations revenue/expenses.\nReal Estate Inventory Valuation and Costing\nInventory consists of raw land, land under development, homes under construction, completed homes, and model homes, which are stated at cost. In addition to direct carrying costs, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes, and related development costs that benefit the entire community, such as field construction supervision and related direct overhead. Home construction costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales at home closing using the specific identification method. Land acquisition, development, interest, real estate taxes and overhead are allocated to homes and units using the relative sales value method. These costs are capitalized to inventory from the point development begins to the point construction is completed. Changes in estimated costs to be incurred in a community are generally allocated to the remaining homes on a prospective basis. For those communities that have been temporarily closed or development has been discontinued, we do not allocate interest or other costs to the community's inventory until activity resumes.\nThe life cycle of the community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of unentitled or entitled land, continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale, construction and delivery of homes. Actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as finished lots.\nWe capitalize qualifying interest costs to inventory during the development and construction periods. Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales when the related inventory is delivered or when the related inventory is charged to cost of sales.\nWe assess the recoverability of our land inventory in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d We review our real estate inventory for indicators of impairment by community during each reporting period. If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we first perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if the carrying value of the assets in that community exceeds the undiscounted cash flows. Generally, if the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated undiscounted cash flows, then the assets are deemed to be impaired and are recorded at fair value as of the assessment date. Our determination of fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model which includes projections and estimates relating to sales prices, construction costs, sales pace, and other factors. Changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis, and actual results may also differ from our assumptions.\nInsurance Costs, Self-Insurance Reserves and Warranty Reserves\nWe have certain deductible amounts under our workers' compensation, automobile and general liability insurance policies, and we record expense and liabilities for the estimated costs of potential claims for construction defects. We also generally require our sub-contractors and design professionals to indemnify us and provide evidence of insurance for liabilities arising from their work, subject to certain limitations. Beneva Indemnity Company ( Beneva\u201d), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, provides insurance coverage for construction defects discovered up to ten years following the closing of a home, premises operations risk and property coverage. We accrue for the expected costs associated with the deductibles and self-insured amounts under our various insurance policies based on historical claims, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, and potential for recovery of costs from insurance and other sources. The estimates are subject to significant variability due to various factors, such as claim settlement patterns, litigation trends and the length of time in which a construction defect claim might be made after the closing of a home.\nWe offer a limited warranty to cover various defects in workmanship or materials, including structural defects. We may also facilitate a longer warranty in certain markets or to comply with regulatory requirements. Warranty reserves are recorded as each home closes in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected future costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods. Our warranty is not considered a separate deliverable in each sale arrangement, so it is accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies.\u201d In accordance with ASC 450, warranties that are not separately priced are generally accounted for by accruing the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation. Thus, the warranty would not be considered a separate deliverable in the arrangement since it is not priced apart from the home. As a result, we accrue the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation in accordance with ASC 450 at the time a home closes, as a component of cost of home closings.\nOur reserves are based on factors that include an actuarial study for historical and anticipated claims, trends related to similar product types, number of home closings, and geographical areas. We also provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration lenders. We regularly review the reasonableness and adequacy of our reserves and make adjustments to the balance of the preexisting reserves to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available. Self-insurance and warranty reserves are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities and Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nWe are involved in joint ventures with related and unrelated third parties for homebuilding and development activities. We use the equity method of accounting for entities over which we exercise significant influence but do not have a controlling interest over the operating and financial policies of the investee. For unconsolidated entities in which we function as the managing member, we have evaluated the rights held by our joint venture partners and determined that they have substantive participating rights that preclude the presumption of control. For joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses is included in equity in income of unconsolidated entities when earned and distributions are credited against its investment in the joint venture when received. These joint ventures are recorded in investments in unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal initial capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation,\u201d we have concluded that when we enter into an option or purchase agreement to acquire land or lots and pay a non-refundable deposit, a VIE may be created because we are deemed to have provided subordinated financial support that will absorb some or all of an entity's expected losses if they occur. If we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we will consolidate the VIE in our Consolidated Financial Statements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned under option agreements within our inventory balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe have issued stock options, performance based restricted stock units and non-performance based restricted stock units, which we account for in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d The fair value for stock options is measured and estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognized evenly over the vesting period of the options. Performance-based restricted stock units are measured using the closing price on the date of grant and expensed using a probability of attainment calculation which determines the likelihood of achieving the performance targets. Non-performance-based restricted stock units are time based awards and measured using the closing price on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. As a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, we have recorded a material charge to earnings in the period ending December 31, 2017. See Note 13 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740-10, Income Taxes,\u201d we evaluate our deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction, including the benefit from net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards by tax jurisdiction, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. Companies must assess, using significant judgments, whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the length of statutory carryforward periods, experience with operating losses and experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings revenue, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,799,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,425,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,889,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land closings revenue\n</td> <td>17,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage operations revenue\n</td> <td>69,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,885,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,550,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,976,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of home closings\n</td> <td>3,092,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,801,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,358,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of land closings\n</td> <td>12,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage operations expenses\n</td> <td>41,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,146,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,869,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,408,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>738,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>680,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>567,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales, commissions and other marketing costs\n</td> <td>259,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>198,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>130,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in income of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>(8,846\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,759\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net\n</td> <td>(577\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(184\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>2,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on foreign currency forward\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,983\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision (1)\n</td> <td>179,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before allocation to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to non-controlling interests -

The markets in this region are showing continued strength as evidenced by a 24.3% increase in sales pace. With our increased focus on turn times and our limited product availability as a result of the increase in the number of community close outs, the number of net homes sold decreased slightly compared to the prior year.

The increases are primarily driven by higher net sales in the first half of the year as compared to the same period in the prior year in our Phoenix and Northern California markets. The 5.6% increase in average selling price is also driven by the Phoenix and Northern California markets as a result of strong consumer demand within these areas.\nLand Closings Revenue\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,745\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>10,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,958\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes. However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending on market opportunities. Land closings revenue was $17.1 million and $64.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The prior year was significantly higher as we were able to capitalize on certain market conditions relative to our long-term strategic assets. The sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 represent legacy land that we held for either appreciation or tax purposes.\nSegment Home Closings Gross Margins\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Central\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings revenue, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,377,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,119,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,102,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,099,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,319,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,206,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,799,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,425,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of home closings\n</td> <td>1,094,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>892,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>899,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>902,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,098,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,006,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,092,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,801,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings gross margin\n</td> <td>283,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>706,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>623,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings gross margin %\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEast:\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 20.6% from 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of product and geographic mix. All divisions in the East experienced an increase in the number of homes closed and several of our markets also experienced an increase in the average sales price, which led to an increase in home closings gross margin. However, certain markets within the region experienced an increase in land development cost which partially offset the increase in home closings revenue net, causing a moderate increase in home closings gross margin percent.\nCentral:\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 18.4% from 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Several markets within the Central region experienced a decrease in construction costs and an increase in\nrebates from our regional and national vendor program. The net decrease in costs of home closings partially contributed to the increase in home closings gross margin percentage. In addition, geographical mix within the region further contributed to the overall increase for 2017.\nWest:\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 16.7% from 16.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Several markets within this region experienced an increase in the number of homes closed, average sales price, and homes closing revenue, net. During 2017, we experienced efficiencies from procurement and operational enhancements, which also contributed to the increase in home closings gross margin. However, we also experienced an increase in land development costs of the homes closed in 2017 compared to those closed in 2016, which partially offset our enhancements.\nMortgage Operations\nOur Mortgage Operations segment provides mortgage lending through our subsidiary, TMHF, and title service through our subsidiary, Inspired Title. The following details the number of loans closed, net income per closed loan, the aggregate value, capture rate, and average FICO on our loans for the following periods:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Closed Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profit per Closed Loan (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Aggregate\nLoan Volume\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Capture\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average FICO\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>4,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,590.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>4,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,492.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes hedging gain/loss\nOur net income per closed loan, excluding the derivative asset, increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the increase in the average loan amount which is a result of the increase in average selling price of homes closed.\nOur mortgage capture rate represents the percentage of our homes sold to a home purchaser that utilized a mortgage and for which the borrower obtained such mortgage from TMHF or one of our preferred third party lenders. The decrease in our capture rate is primarily due to increased competition for new home mortgages.\nSales, Commissions and Other Marketing Costs\nSales commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, decreased period over period to 6.8% from 7.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease is primarily driven by efficiencies we have achieved as a result of previous investments we have made in our sales and marketing functions. In addition, the prior year period had higher sales and marketing costs as a result of our acquired divisions and an increase in new communities which typically have incremental startup costs during their early stages.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home closings revenue, decreased period over period to 3.4% from 3.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease was attributable to increased home closings revenue in addition to gaining leverage on existing infrastructure to maintain stable operating costs.\nEquity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities was $8.8 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the number of active unconsolidated joint ventures and the timing of openings. We had six unconsolidated joint ventures which were open and active for the full year ended December 31, 2017. In the prior year, we had five unconsolidated joint ventures which were active all year with the sixth unconsolidated joint venture opening in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInterest Income, net\nInterest income, net includes interest earned on cash balances offset by interest incurred but not capitalized on our long-term debt and other borrowings. Interest income, net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was consistent.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The prior year balance included higher accruals for contingent consideration relating to our acquisitions and pre-acquisition costs on abandoned land projects.\nUS Tax Reform\nThe Tax Act made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax of foreign earnings at a reduced rate that may be, payable over eight years.\nThe Tax Act has a material impact to our current financial statements and we expect the Tax Act will have a material impact to our future financial statements. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we have recorded an estimated income tax expense of $57.4 million to account for the lower tax rate impact to our existing deferred tax assets. In addition, we have recorded an estimated $3.6 million charge related to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015. We expect the Tax Act will have a favorable impact to tax expense and earnings per share beginning in 2018.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur effective tax rate was 50.3% and 34.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Tax Act made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate that that may be payable over eight years.\nIn response to the Tax Act, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allows for the recording provisional amounts during a one year measurement period\u201d similar to that used when accounting for business combinations, if the Company has a reasonable estimate of the impact but the accounting is not yet complete. The measurement period is deemed to have ended in either one calendar year or when the Company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act, whichever is earlier.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, we have recorded a discrete net tax expense of $61 million related to impacts related to the Tax Act. The net expense includes our estimated $57.4 million expense related to the write-down of our existing deferred tax assets to reflect the newly enacted U.S. federal tax rate, in accordance with SAB 118. The provisional expense is the Company's best estimate of the deferred tax asset write-down at this time. However, the estimate may be impacted by our calculation of additional adjustments made to federal temporary differences arising from a tax accounting method change filed with the IRS and the state tax effect of these additional adjustments.\nThe net expense related to the Tax Act recorded during the period ended December 31, 2017, also includes an estimated $3.6 million expense from the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian business in 2015. The Tax Act imposes a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) of certain foreign subsidiaries to their 10% U.S. shareholders (regardless of whether such E&P is distributed) at a rate of 15.5% for U.S. corporate shareholders to the extent E&P does not exceed the U.S. shareholder's aggregate foreign cash position (as defined in the Tax Act) and 8% for E&P in excess of such cash position. The resulting tax may be payable over eight years. The mandatory tax is partially offset by foreign tax credits generated by cash taxes that our Canadian subsidiaries previously paid. To determine the amount of the foreign repatriation tax, we determined, in addition to other factors, the amount of E&P of the subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. The provisional expense is the Company's best estimate of the foreign repatriation tax at this time, however it is subject to change in the future as we are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the tax.\nOur as adjusted effective tax rate excluding the impacts of the Tax Act was 33.2% and 34.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our effective rate for both years was affected by a number of\nfactors, the most significant of which included state income taxes, the establishment of reserves for uncertain tax positions, adjustments to state net operating losses, changes in valuation allowances, and preferential treatment of certain deductions and energy credits relating to homebuilding activities.\nNet Income\nNet income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $176.7 million and $1.47, respectively. As adjusted net income from continuing operations and as adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $237.6 million and $1.98, respectively. Net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $206.6 million and $1.69, respectively. Adjusting for the tax reform impact, the increase in net income and earnings per share from the prior year is attributable to an increase in margin dollars as a result of the increase in both the number of homes closed and average selling price of homes closed.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nAverage Active Selling Communities\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated:\nAverage active selling communities increased 19.3%, primarily in the East region due to the acquisitions of JEH Homes ( JEH\u201d) in April 2015 and three divisions of Orleans Homes ( Orleans\u201d) in July 2015.

The change in the total sales value was a result of a higher number of units, primarily attributable to an increase in average active selling communities in the majority of our markets. In addition, the results for 2016 represent full period net sales orders from our acquired divisions, whereas the 2015 balances include data for the acquired divisions only for the periods since their respective acquisitions. The average selling price of net homes sold increased throughout the region for 2016 due to product mix.\nCentral:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes decreased by 8.5% and 6.0%, respectively, whereas the average selling price increased by 2.6%. Despite the decrease in the annual results for this region, we experienced fourth quarter improvements in 2016 in the Central region with increases in net sales orders and total sales value by 13.1% and 12.5%, respectively, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. While slower job growth and a decline in relocations to Houston compared to previous years impacted the year-over-year performance, the divisions in the Central region experienced increased average selling prices for 2016 as well as declining cancellation rates.\nWest:\nThe number of net homes sold remained relatively flat and sales value of homes increased by 14.1%, respectively, primarily due to an increase in average active selling communities in our California markets. The average selling price of net homes sold increased by 13.5% as a result of our performance in several of our markets in California and Phoenix which experienced price increases due to increased consumer demand.\nSales Order Cancellations\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cancellation Rate (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Cancellation rate represents the number of canceled sales orders divided by gross sales orders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated cancellation rate decreased to 13.6% from 13.9% year over year.

The increase in backlog units is primarily as a result of the combination of increased sales orders and a decrease in our cancellation rate. The increase in total sales value is directionally consistent with the 2.9% increase in the average selling price which is a result of higher average selling prices for net sales orders.\nHome Closings Revenue\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Homes Closed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Home Closings Revenue, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Selling Price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>2,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,119,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>833,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>2,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,099,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,082,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>2,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,206,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>974,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>7,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,425,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,889,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEast:\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 36.8% and 34.3%, respectively, for the 2016 year as compared to the 2015 year primarily due to the current year results encompassing a full period of home closings from all of our acquired divisions, whereas 2015 included results only for JEH and the acquired divisions of Orleans for a partial year. Additionally, we organically grew our markets through community openings which resulted in increased homes closed. Certain economic market improvements, as well as favorable homebuyer reception of new products and new communities, contributed to the increase in net home closings revenue in 2016 compared to 2015. The average selling price decreased by 1.8% as a result of the newly acquired markets over the past year in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, and Raleigh where average selling prices were lower than our legacy markets.\nCentral:\nThe number of homes closed decreased by 1.3% for the 2016 year as compared to the 2015 year primarily as a result of our Houston market. Higher price point homes in this market have been affected the most by oil industry economic factors in Texas in 2016. While the high price point homes were the most affected in home closings units, the majority of the markets within this region experienced price appreciation, which contributed to the region's 1.6% increase in home closings revenue, net in 2016 and a 3.0% increase in average selling price compared to 2015.\nWest:\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 16.4% and 23.8%, respectively for the 2016 year as compared to the 2015 year. The increase in units was primarily driven by our Phoenix market which continued to grow as a result of job growth and a lower cost of living when compared to other markets. Our Phoenix and California markets contributed to the increase in home closing revenue, net as a result of increased average selling price\nLand Closings Revenue\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>29,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>13,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes. However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending on market opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, land closings revenue increased by $20.8 million as we were able to capitalize on certain market conditions relative to our long-term strategic assets. The sales represent legacy land that we held for either appreciation or tax purposes. During 2016, the tax holding period for certain land assets expired, preserving certain tax benefits, thus resulting in our significant land sales.\nSegment Home Closings Gross Margins\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Central\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings revenue, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,119,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>833,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,099,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,082,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,206,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>974,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,425,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,889,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of home closings\n</td> <td>892,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>655,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>902,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>886,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,006,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>816,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,801,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,358,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings gross margin\n</td> <td>226,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>623,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home closings gross margin %\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated:\nOur consolidated home closings gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 18.2% from 18.4% compared to the prior year. Amortization of capitalized interest benefited our overall margins as we have experienced a decrease in our interest incurred from the redemption, in May 2015, of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 ( the 2020 Notes\u201d) and issuance, in April 2015, of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023. Partially offsetting this benefit, in 2016, we increased closings of aged finished inventory which negatively impacted margins as such homes typically have lower margins than to-be-built homes and a higher cost of capital due to longer carry times. Purchase accounting also negatively impacted our consolidated gross margin percentage in 2016 when compared to 2015.\nEast:\nHome closings gross margin percentage decreased to 20.2% from 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an overall shift in our product mix from our higher margin homes in our Florida divisions to our newly acquired divisions, which have slightly lower margin percentages. An impairment charge of approximately $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, in our Chicago division negatively impacted our home closings gross margin results. Furthermore, the effects of purchase accounting stemming from these business combinations has also negatively impacted home closings gross margin in this region.\nCentral:\nHome closings gross margin percentage remained relatively consistent for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Despite the economic uncertainty regarding the oil industry, which occurred throughout 2016 and thereby negatively impacting the number of homes closed, the Central region maintained home closings gross margin percentage through sales price increases in markets other than Houston.\nWest:\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 16.6% from 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. The majority of the markets within this region experienced an increase in their margins through sales price increases to offset the increase in land, development and construction costs.\nMortgage Operations\nOur Mortgage Operations segment provides mortgage lending through our subsidiary, TMHF, and title service through our subsidiary, Inspired Title.

In addition, 2015 was negatively impacted by an increase in overhead related to increasing our in-house underwriting platform in preparation for shifting to agency originations and additional regulation\nOur mortgage capture rate represents the percentage of our homes sold to a home purchaser that utilized a mortgage and for which the borrower obtained such mortgage from TMHF or one of our preferred third party lenders.\nSales, Commissions and Other Marketing Costs\nSales commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, increased slightly period over period to 7.0% from 6.9% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This was primarily a result of our increase in the number of open communities in 2016. Our new communities typically have higher sales and marketing costs during their early stages of sales due to various start up costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home closings revenue, were 3.6% and 3.3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was attributable to increased headcount and other investments we have made for future business optimization, as well as the acquisition we completed in 2016.\nEquity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities was $7.5 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change was primarily due to the timing of our unconsolidated joint venture openings. We had two additional unconsolidated joint ventures fully active during 2016 compared to the prior year.\nInterest Income, net\nInterest income, net includes interest earned on cash balances offset by interest incurred but not capitalized on our long-term debt and other borrowings. Interest income, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was consistent.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $11.9 million and $11.6 million, respectively. The majority of the expense for both periods relates to earn-out activity, captive insurance claims costs, financing fees on our Revolving Credit Facility, and pre-acquisition costs on abandoned land projects.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn May 2015, we redeemed the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 105.813% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the date of the redemption. As a result of the redemption, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $33.3 million, which included the payment of the redemption premium and write-off of net unamortized deferred financing fees.\nWe had no such transactions for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGain on Foreign Currency Forward\nIn December 2014, we entered into a derivative financial instrument in the form of a foreign currency forward. The derivative financial instrument hedged our exposure to the Canadian dollar in conjunction with the disposition of the Monarch business. The final settlement of the derivative financial instrument occurred on January 30, 2015, and a gain in the amount of $30.0 million was recorded in gain on foreign currency forward in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe had no such transactions for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur effective tax rate was 34.3% and 34.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The effective rate for both years was affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which included state income taxes, the establishment of reserves for uncertain tax positions, changes in valuation allowances, and preferential treatment of certain deductions and energy credits relating to homebuilding activities.\nNet Income\nNet income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $206.6 million and $1.69, respectively. Net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $171.0 million and $1.38. The increase in net income and earnings per share from the prior year is attributable to an increase in margin dollars as a result of the increase in both the number of homes closed and average selling price of homes closed.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe finance our operations through the following:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Borrowings under our revolving credit facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our various series of senior notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mortgage warehouse facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Project-level financing (including non-recourse loans);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Performance, payment and completion surety bonds, and letters of credit; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash generated from operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that we can fund our current and foreseeable liquidity needs for the next 12 months from:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash generated from operations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe may also access the capital markets to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity offerings on an opportunistic basis. Our principal uses of capital for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were homebuilding acquisitions, land purchases, lot development, home construction, operating expenses, payment of debt service, income taxes, investments in joint ventures, stock repurchases and the payment of various liabilities. In addition, net proceeds from our equity offerings during the year were used to repurchase our Principal Equityholders' indirect interest in TMHC. Cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle, and can differ substantially from reported earnings. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash expenditures for land acquisitions, on and off-site development, construction of model homes, general landscaping and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outflows prior to recognition of earnings.\nThe table below summarizes our total cash and liquidity as of the dates indicated:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Cash, including Restricted Cash(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>575,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of Credit Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,126\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,903\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility Availability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>452,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>468,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,028,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>769,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) In January 2018, we completed two additional equity offerings which included the purchase of 7.6 million shares of our Class B Common Stock from our Principal Equityholders for approximately $200.0 million.\nCash Flow Activities\nOperating Cash Flow Activities\nOur net cash provided by operating activities was $386.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $372.6 million provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale as a result of selling more loans offset by a smaller decrease in real estate inventory year over year. The decreases in mortgage loans held for sale and real estate inventory were partially offset by lower net income before allocation to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the change between periods was the 2016 acquisition of Acadia for $52.8 million.\nFinancing Cash Flow Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to cash used in financing activities of $117.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the change between periods was the repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility in 2016. We did not have any borrowings or repayments on our Revolving Credit Facility in 2017.\nDebt Instruments\nSenior Notes:\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding senior unsecured notes (collectively, the Senior Notes\u201d), as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Date Issued\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Initial Offering\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Original Net Proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Original Debt\nIssuance\nCost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes due 2021\n</td> <td>April 16, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.250\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes due 2023\n</td> <td>April 16, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.875\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes due 2024\n</td> <td>March 5, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.625\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,232,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2021 Senior Notes\nOn April 16, 2013, we issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Senior Notes\u201d).\nThe 2021 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2021. The 2021 Senior Notes are guaranteed by TMM Holdings, Taylor Morrison Holdings, Inc., Taylor Morrison Communities II, Inc. and their homebuilding subsidiaries (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d), which are all subsidiaries directly or indirectly of TMHC. The 2021 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights. The indenture for the 2021 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit (i) the making of investments, (ii) the payment of dividends and the redemption of equity and junior debt, (iii) the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (iv) asset dispositions, (v) mergers and similar corporate transactions, (vi) the incurrence of liens, (vii) prohibitions on payments and asset transfers among the issuers and restricted subsidiaries and (viii) transactions with affiliates, among others. The indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes contains customary events of default. If we do not apply the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales within specified deadlines, we will be required to offer to repurchase the 2021 Senior Notes at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest) with such proceeds. We are also required to offer to repurchase the 2021 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) upon certain change of control events.\nThe 2021 Senior Notes are redeemable at scheduled redemption prices, currently at 102.625%, of their principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2021 Senior Notes.\n2023 Senior Notes and Redemption of the 2020 Notes\nOn April 16, 2015, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2023 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights. The net proceeds of the offering, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the entire remaining principal amount of the 2020 Notes on May 1, 2015, at a redemption price of 105.813% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption. As a result of the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $33.3 million during the second quarter of 2015, which included the payment of the redemption premium and write-off of net unamortized deferred financing fees.\nThe 2023 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2023. The 2023 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee the 2021 Senior Notes. The indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. The indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes contains events of default that are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes. The change of control provisions in the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes, but a credit rating downgrade must occur in connection with the change of control before the repurchase offer requirement is triggered for the 2023 Senior Notes.\nPrior to January 15, 2023, the 2023 Senior Notes are redeemable at a price equal to 100% plus a make-whole\u201d premium for payments through January 15, 2023 (plus accrued and unpaid interest). Beginning January 15, 2023, the 2023 Senior Notes are redeemable at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2023 Senior Notes.\n2024 Senior Notes\nOn March 5, 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes\u201d).\nThe 2024 Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2024. The 2024 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee the 2021 and 2023 Senior Notes. The 2024 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions similar to the 2023 Senior Notes. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes contains events of default that are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2021 and 2023 Senior Notes. The change of control provisions in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes.\nPrior to December 1, 2023, the 2024 Senior Notes are redeemable at a price equal to 100% plus a make-whole\u201d premium for payments through December 1, 2023 (plus accrued and unpaid interest). Beginning on December 1, 2023, the 2024 Senior Notes are redeemable at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2024 Senior Notes.\nTMHC Compared to TMM Holdings\nTMM Holdings is a parent guarantor of certain of our debt facilities. The financial information of TMHC is substantially identical to the financial performance and operations of TMM Holdings except for certain costs associated with maintaining a public company status and Class A common stock, which are attributable to TMHC.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAt December 31, 2017, our $500.0 million Revolving Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on April 12, 2019. On January 26, 2018, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from April 12, 2019 to January 26, 2022.\nOther immaterial changes were also made to the structure of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee the 2021, 2023 and 2024 Senior Notes.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains certain springing\u201d financial covenants, requiring us and our subsidiaries to comply with a maximum debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60 to 1.00 and a minimum consolidated tangible net worth level of at least $1.6 billion. The financial covenants would be in effect for any fiscal quarter during which any (a) loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are outstanding during the last day of such fiscal quarter or on more than five separate days during such fiscal quarter or (b) undrawn letters of credit (except to the extent cash collateralized) issued under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount greater than $40.0 million or unreimbursed letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility are outstanding on the last day of such fiscal quarter or for more than five consecutive days during such fiscal quarter.\nFor purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants for any fiscal quarter, the Revolving Credit Facility provides that we may exercise an equity cure by issuing certain permitted securities for cash or otherwise recording cash contributions to our capital that will, upon the contribution of such cash to the borrower, be included in the calculation of consolidated tangible net worth and consolidated total capitalization. The equity cure right is exercisable up to twice in any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and up to five times overall.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants including limitations on incurrence of liens, dividends and other distributions, asset dispositions and investments in entities that are not guarantors, limitations on prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and limitations on fundamental changes. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default, subject to applicable grace periods, including for nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts, violation of covenants (including financial covenants, subject to the exercise of an equity cure), incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect, cross default and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material monetary judgments, ERISA events with material adverse effect, actual or asserted invalidity of material guarantees and change of control. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nMortgage Warehouse Borrowings\nThe following is a summary of our mortgage subsidiary warehouse borrowings:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility\n</td> <td>Amount\nDrawn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Facility\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expiration Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Collateral (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flagstar\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30 days written notice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comerica\n</td> <td>41,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>On Demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>J.P.

Project-level debt is generally secured by the land that was acquired and the principal payments generally coincide with corresponding project lot sales or a principal reduction schedule. Loans payable bear interest at rates that ranged from 0% to 8% at December 31, 2017 and 2016. We impute interest for loans with no stated interest rates.\nLetters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Financial Guarantees\nThe following table summarizes our letters of credit and surety bonds as of the dates indicated:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surety bonds\n</td> <td>284,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was $200 million total capacity of letters of credit available under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2017\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefit obligations including interest and penalties\n</td> <td>6,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land purchase contracts and lot options\n</td> <td>405,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes (1)\n</td> <td>1,250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt outstanding (1)\n</td> <td>258,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest expense (2)\n</td> <td>415,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,363,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>458,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>384,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>735,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>784,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2017 total debt outstanding included $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Senior Notes, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Senior Notes, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Notes, $118.8 million of mortgage borrowings by TMHF, no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility, and $139.5 million of loans and other borrowings.

The use of these entities, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or\ncould not obtain access on terms that are as favorable. Our partners in these joint ventures historically have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to sites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large or expensive land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners' capital. In certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures, we enter into loan agreements, whereby one of our subsidiaries will provide the lenders with customary guarantees, including completion, indemnity and environmental guarantees subject to usual non-recourse terms.\nThe following is a summary of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>32,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>126,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Operations\n</td> <td>3,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLand Purchase and Land Option Contracts\nWe enter into land purchase and option contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes in the ordinary course of business.

Such expenses only occurred for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the Tax Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017. As adjusted earnings per common share utilizes the as adjusted net income from continuing operations measure within the numerator of the earnings per share calculation. As adjusted income tax provision and As adjusted effective tax rate reflect our income tax provision adjusted to exclude the impact of tax reform. We calculate net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio by dividing (i) total debt, less unamortized debt issuance costs and mortgage warehouse borrowings, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, by (ii) total capitalization (the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders' equity). Management uses all of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operational and economic performance and to set targets for performance-based compensation on a consolidated basis to compare to prior years which did not include such significant tax reform. We also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry. We believe as adjusted net income from continuing operations, as adjusted earnings per common share, as adjusted income tax provision and as adjusted effective tax rate are relevant and useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the performance of our operations without the significant effect of the Tax Act. Because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry, we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason. These measures are considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance.\nrebates from our regional and national vendor program.

While we were encouraged by certain positive and improved trends during 2017, several challenges still exist, such as lingering under employment concerns, stagnation in real wages and real or perceived personal wealth, national and global economic uncertainty and uncertainty around the interest rate environment. We are additionally challenged by shortages in the labor supply, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, and volatility in energy prices. Nevertheless, we believe we are in an upward business cycle.\nThe 2021 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2021.

compared to the prior year. Amortization of capitalized interest benefited our overall margins as we have experienced a decrease in our interest incurred from the redemption, in May 2015, of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 ( the 2020 Notes\u201d) and issuance, in April 2015, of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023. Partially offsetting this benefit, in 2016, we increased closings of aged finished inventory which negatively impacted margins as such homes typically have lower margins than to-be-built homes and a higher cost of capital due to longer carry times. Purchase accounting also negatively impacted our consolidated gross margin percentage in 2016 when compared to 2015.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Sold Homes in Backlog (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Selling Price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>1,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>524,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>1,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>534,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>513,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>3,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,702,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,531,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements as of December 31, 2017\nCentral:\nLand Closings Revenue\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Cancellation Rate (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Company\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn April 16, 2015, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Senior Notes\u201d).

As a result of the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $33.3 million during the second quarter of 2015, which included the payment of the redemption premium and write-off of net unamortized deferred financing fees.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities and Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nOther Expense, net\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax reform impact due to the revaluation of deferred assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>(57,425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax reform impact due to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings\n</td> <td>(3,553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As adjusted income tax provision\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As adjusted effective tax rate\n</td> <td>33.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surety bonds\n</td> <td>284,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Cash, including Restricted Cash(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>575,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of Credit Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,126\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,903\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility Availability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>452,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>468,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,028,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>769,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), we have provided information in this Annual Report relating to as adjusted net income from continuing operations,\u201d as adjusted earnings per common share,\u201d as adjusted income tax provision,\u201d as adjusted effective tax rate,\u201d and net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio.\u201d\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 18.4% from 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Several markets within the Central region experienced a decrease in construction costs and an increase in\n \u2022 We ended 2017 with $1.7 billion in sales order backlog. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to cash used in financing activities of $117.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the change between periods was the repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility in 2016. We did not have any borrowings or repayments on our Revolving Credit Facility in 2017.\n\nSales Order Cancellations\n\nWe had no such transactions for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \n \u2022 We generated $3.9 billion in total revenue and $3.8 billion in home closings revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year's home closings revenue. \n \u2022 Since January 2017, we have completed seven public offerings for an aggregate of 80.2 million shares of our Class A Common Stock, using all of the net proceeds therefrom to repurchase our Principal Equityholders' indirect interest in TMHC. In January 2018, we also purchased an additional 7.6 million shares of our Class B Common Stock from our Principal Equityholders. As a result of the series of offerings and repurchases, the Principal Equityholders ownership decreased to 31.1% at December 31, 2017 and to zero by January 31, 2018. \n(1) Sales order backlog represents homes under contract for which revenue has not yet been recognized at the end of the period (including homes sold but not yet started). Some of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in future cancellations.\nOther immaterial changes were also made to the structure of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee the 2021, 2023 and 2024 Senior Notes.\n \u2022 On January 26, 2018 we amended the maturity date of our $500 million Revolving Credit Facility from April 2019 to January 2022 allowing incremental financial flexibility. \nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 19.7% and 23.1%, respectively, for 2017 as compared to 2016. All markets within this region contributed to the increase in both units and dollars as a result of higher net sales in the first half of the year as compared to the same period in the prior year. Certain economic market improvements, as well as favorable homebuyer reception of our products and our communities, contributed to the increase in net home closings revenue.\n \u2022 Net income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $176.7 million and $1.47 compared to $206.6 million and $1.69 for the year ended December 31, 2016. \nRevolving Credit Facility\nEquity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities\n\n \u2022 Borrowings under our revolving credit facility; \nSales, Commissions and Other Marketing Costs\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2024 Senior Notes.\nTotal backlog units and total sales value increased by 6.8% and 10.0% at 2016 year end as compared to the 2015 year end, respectively. The increase in backlog units is primarily as a result of the combination of increased sales orders and a decrease in our cancellation rate. The increase in total sales value is directionally consistent with the 2.9% increase in the average selling price which is a result of higher average selling prices for net sales orders.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home closings revenue, decreased period over period to 3.4% from 3.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease was attributable to increased home closings revenue in addition to gaining leverage on existing infrastructure to maintain stable operating costs.\nWe have issued stock options, performance based restricted stock units and non-performance based restricted stock units, which we account for in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d The fair value for stock options is measured and estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognized evenly over the vesting period of the options. Performance-based restricted stock units are measured using the closing price on the date of grant and expensed using a probability of attainment calculation which determines the likelihood of achieving the performance targets. Non-performance-based restricted stock units are time based awards and measured using the closing price on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nMortgage Warehouse Borrowings\nOur net cash provided by operating activities was $386.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $372.6 million provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale as a result of selling more loans offset by a smaller decrease in real estate inventory year over year. The decreases in mortgage loans held for sale and real estate inventory were partially offset by lower net income before allocation to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nNet Income\nEast:\nSales Order Backlog\nGain on Foreign Currency Forward\nIncome Tax Provision\n\nOur mortgage capture rate represents the percentage of our homes sold to a home purchaser that utilized a mortgage and for which the borrower obtained such mortgage from TMHF or one of our preferred third party lenders.\nEquity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities\nEast:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes decreased by 8.5% and 6.0%, respectively, whereas the average selling price increased by 2.6%. Despite the decrease in the annual results for this region, we experienced fourth quarter improvements in 2016 in the Central region with increases in net sales orders and total sales value by 13.1% and 12.5%, respectively, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. While slower job growth and a decline in relocations to Houston compared to previous years impacted the year-over-year performance, the divisions in the Central region experienced increased average selling prices for 2016 as well as declining cancellation rates.\nWe believe that we can fund our current and foreseeable liquidity needs for the next 12 months from:\n\n\nEast:\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $11.9 million and $11.6 million, respectively. The majority of the expense for both periods relates to earn-out activity, captive insurance claims costs, financing fees on our Revolving Credit Facility, and pre-acquisition costs on abandoned land projects.\n2017 Highlights and Recent Developments\nStock Based Compensation\n \u2022 Average sales price of homes closed was $473,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. \nWe are involved in joint ventures with related and unrelated third parties for homebuilding and development activities. We use the equity method of accounting for entities over which we exercise significant influence but do not have a controlling interest over the operating and financial policies of the investee. For unconsolidated entities in which we function as the managing member, we have evaluated the rights held by our joint venture partners and determined that they have substantive participating rights that preclude the presumption of control. For joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses is included in equity in income of unconsolidated entities when earned and distributions are credited against its investment in the joint venture when received. These joint ventures are recorded in investments in unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nSales commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, increased slightly period over period to 7.0% from 6.9% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This was primarily a result of our increase in the number of open communities in 2016. Our new communities typically have higher sales and marketing costs during their early stages of sales due to various start up costs.\nNet Sales Orders\nSales commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, decreased period over period to 6.8% from 7.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease is primarily driven by efficiencies we have achieved as a result of previous investments we have made in our sales and marketing functions. In addition, the prior year period had higher sales and marketing costs as a result of our acquired divisions and an increase in new communities which typically have incremental startup costs during their early stages.\nDuring 2017, tax legislation was enacted which made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a mandatory deemed repatriation tax of foreign earnings at a reduced rate, that may be payable over eight years. Our effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2017 includes one-time tax expense charges to account for the lower tax rate impact to our existing deferred tax assets and the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015. In 2018, we expect to have a lower annual effective tax rate due to the reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate.\n(1) Cancellation rate represents the number of canceled sales orders divided by gross sales orders.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLoans Payable and Other Borrowings\n \u2022 Adjusting for the effects of the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $237.6 million or 15.0% higher than the prior year. Similarly, diluted earnings per share adjusted for tax reform effects in 2017 was $1.98 compared to $1.69 for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 13 - Income taxes for discussion regarding Tax Act effects. \nWest:\n2024 Senior Notes\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding senior unsecured notes (collectively, the Senior Notes\u201d), as of December 31, 2017.\nLoans payable and other borrowings as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 consist of project-level debt due to various land sellers and seller financing notes from current and prior year acquisitions. Project-level debt is generally secured by the land that was acquired and the principal payments generally coincide with corresponding project lot sales or a principal reduction schedule. Loans payable bear interest at rates that ranged from 0% to 8% at December 31, 2017 and 2016. We impute interest for loans with no stated interest rates.\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 20.6% from 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of product and geographic mix. All divisions in the East experienced an increase in the number of homes closed and several of our markets also experienced an increase in the average sales price, which led to an increase in home closings gross margin. However, certain markets within the region experienced an increase in land development cost which partially offset the increase in home closings revenue net, causing a moderate increase in home closings gross margin percent.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, we have recorded a discrete net tax expense of $61 million related to impacts related to the Tax Act. The net expense includes our estimated $57.4 million expense related to the write-down of our existing deferred tax assets to reflect the newly enacted U.S. federal tax rate, in accordance with SAB 118. The provisional expense is the Company's best estimate of the deferred tax asset write-down at this time. However, the estimate may be impacted by our calculation of additional adjustments made to federal temporary differences arising from a tax accounting method change filed with the IRS and the state tax effect of these additional adjustments.\nPrior to January 15, 2023, the 2023 Senior Notes are redeemable at a price equal to 100% plus a make-whole\u201d premium for payments through January 15, 2023 (plus accrued and unpaid interest). Beginning January 15, 2023, the 2023 Senior Notes are redeemable at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\nOur Mortgage Operations segment provides mortgage lending through our subsidiary, TMHF, and title service through our subsidiary, Inspired Title. The following details the number of loans closed, net income per closed loan, the aggregate value, capture rate, and average FICO on our loans for the following periods:\n (2) Estimated interest expense amounts for debt outstanding at the respective contractual interest rates, the weighted average of which was 5.5% as of December 31, 2017. \n(1) Sales order backlog represents homes under contract for which revenue has not yet been recognized at the end of the period (including homes sold but not yet started). Some of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in future cancellations.\n\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net remained relatively flat for the 2017 year as compared to the 2016 year primarily as a result of Hurricane Harvey, which affected the Houston market during the third quarter of 2017. As a result of the hurricane, some closings were pushed to future periods. Houston along with the other markets within the region\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2017, our total liquidity was $1.0 billion, including $573.9 million in cash. \nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 46.6% and 51.7%, respectively, primarily due to the acquisitions of JEH, Acadia Homes ( Acadia\u201d) and Orleans, which contributed to the increase in communities. The change in the total sales value was a result of a higher number of units, primarily attributable to an increase in average active selling communities in the majority of our markets. In addition, the results for 2016 represent full period net sales orders from our acquired divisions, whereas the 2015 balances include data for the acquired divisions only for the periods since their respective acquisitions. The average selling price of net homes sold increased throughout the region for 2016 due to product mix.\nLoan origination fees (including title fees, points, and closing costs) are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. All of the loans TMHF originates are sold to third party investors within a short period of time (typically within 15-20 business days) on a non-recourse basis. Gains and losses from the sale of mortgages are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 860-20, Sales of Financial Assets.\u201d Because TMHF does not have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, we derecognize the mortgage loans at time of sale, based on the difference between the selling price and carrying value of the related loans upon sale, recording a gain/loss on sale in the period of sale. Also, we enter into IRLCs to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time. These instruments meet the definition of a derivative and the realized and unrealized gain and loss from the IRLCs are included in mortgage operations revenue/expenses.\nSales, Commissions and Other Marketing Costs\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2023 Senior Notes.\nOur financial and operational highlights for the year ended December 31, 2017 and recent developments subsequent to the year end are summarized below:\nWe assess the recoverability of our land inventory in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d We review our real estate inventory for indicators of impairment by community during each reporting period. If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we first perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if the carrying value of the assets in that community exceeds the undiscounted cash flows. Generally, if the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated undiscounted cash flows, then the assets are deemed to be impaired and are recorded at fair value as of the assessment date. Our determination of fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model which includes projections and estimates relating to sales prices, construction costs, sales pace, and other factors. Changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis, and actual results may also differ from our assumptions.\nThe Management's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The primary factors that affect the comparability of our results of operations are the impacts of the Tax Act, our acquisitions, and disposal activities.\nThe 2024 Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2024. The 2024 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee the 2021 and 2023 Senior Notes. The 2024 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions similar to the 2023 Senior Notes. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes contains events of default that are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2021 and 2023 Senior Notes. The change of control provisions in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes.\nGeneral\n(1) Excludes hedging gain/loss\nHome Closings Revenue\nWest:\nAt December 31, 2017, our $500.0 million Revolving Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on April 12, 2019. On January 26, 2018, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from April 12, 2019 to January 26, 2022.\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 16.7% from 16.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Several markets within this region experienced an increase in the number of homes closed, average sales price, and homes closing revenue, net. During 2017, we experienced efficiencies from procurement and operational enhancements, which also contributed to the increase in home closings gross margin. However, we also experienced an increase in land development costs of the homes closed in 2017 compared to those closed in 2016, which partially offset our enhancements.\n\nLand closings revenue is recognized when title is transferred to the buyer, we have no significant continuing involvement, the buyer has demonstrated sufficient investment in the property sold and the receivable, if any, from the buyer is not subject to future subordination. If the buyer has not made an adequate investment in the property, the profit on such sale is deferred until these conditions are met.\n \u2022 Our various series of senior notes; \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur net income per closed loan increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased margins as a result of improvements in the gain on sale of loans due to better investor pricing from our mandatory commitments model. In addition, 2015 was negatively impacted by an increase in overhead related to increasing our in-house underwriting platform in preparation for shifting to agency originations and additional regulation\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal initial capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation,\u201d we have concluded that when we enter into an option or purchase agreement to acquire land or lots and pay a non-refundable deposit, a VIE may be created because we are deemed to have provided subordinated financial support that will absorb some or all of an entity's expected losses if they occur. If we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we will consolidate the VIE in our Consolidated Financial Statements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned under option agreements within our inventory balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOur net income per closed loan, excluding the derivative asset, increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the increase in the average loan amount which is a result of the increase in average selling price of homes closed.\nFinancing Cash Flow Activities\nFor purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants for any fiscal quarter, the Revolving Credit Facility provides that we may exercise an equity cure by issuing certain permitted securities for cash or otherwise recording cash contributions to our capital that will, upon the contribution of such cash to the borrower, be included in the calculation of consolidated tangible net worth and consolidated total capitalization. The equity cure right is exercisable up to twice in any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and up to five times overall.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Results\nThe number of homes closed decreased by 1.3% for the 2016 year as compared to the 2015 year primarily as a result of our Houston market. Higher price point homes in this market have been affected the most by oil industry economic factors in Texas in 2016. While the high price point homes were the most affected in home closings units, the majority of the markets within this region experienced price appreciation, which contributed to the region's 1.6% increase in home closings revenue, net in 2016 and a 3.0% increase in average selling price compared to 2015.\nThe 2023 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2023. The 2023 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee the 2021 Senior Notes. The indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. The indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes contains events of default that are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes. The change of control provisions in the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes, but a credit rating downgrade must occur in connection with the change of control before the repurchase offer requirement is triggered for the 2023 Senior Notes.\nAverage Active Selling Communities\nWe participate in strategic land development and homebuilding joint ventures with related and unrelated third parties. The use of these entities, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or\nCentral:\n (1) Cancellation rate represents the number of canceled sales orders divided by gross sales orders. \nIn May 2015, we redeemed the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 105.813% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the date of the redemption. As a result of the redemption, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $33.3 million, which included the payment of the redemption premium and write-off of net unamortized deferred financing fees.\nInventory consists of raw land, land under development, homes under construction, completed homes, and model homes, which are stated at cost. In addition to direct carrying costs, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes, and related development costs that benefit the entire community, such as field construction supervision and related direct overhead. Home construction costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales at home closing using the specific identification method. Land acquisition, development, interest, real estate taxes and overhead are allocated to homes and units using the relative sales value method. These costs are capitalized to inventory from the point development begins to the point construction is completed. Changes in estimated costs to be incurred in a community are generally allocated to the remaining homes on a prospective basis. For those communities that have been temporarily closed or development has been discontinued, we do not allocate interest or other costs to the community's inventory until activity resumes.\nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\nMortgage Operations\n \u2022 Cash generated from operations; and \nThe table below summarizes our total cash and liquidity as of the dates indicated:\nOn April 16, 2013, we issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Senior Notes\u201d).\nMortgage Operations\nThe following is a summary of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 19.3% and 20.2%, respectively, in 2017 as compared to 2016. Product and geographic mix among all divisions within the region contributed to the overall increase in in net homes sold and sales value. Certain divisions experienced an increase in sales price along with an increase in net homes sold, while others maintained their sales price and increased the number of net homes sold.\nAverage active selling communities increased 19.3%, primarily in the East region due to the acquisitions of JEH Homes ( JEH\u201d) in April 2015 and three divisions of Orleans Homes ( Orleans\u201d) in July 2015. In addition, we experienced community growth in existing divisions in our Central and West regions such as Houston, Austin and divisions within our California market. We also opened new communities and closed out existing communities throughout all of our legacy markets.\n(1) 2017 income tax provision, effective tax rate and earnings per common share data include impacts of the Tax Act, which was an aggregate $61.0 million expense.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur effective tax rate was 34.3% and 34.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The effective rate for both years was affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which included state income taxes, the establishment of reserves for uncertain tax positions, changes in valuation allowances, and preferential treatment of certain deductions and energy credits relating to homebuilding activities.\nUS Tax Reform\nThe Tax Act has a material impact to our current financial statements and we expect the Tax Act will have a material impact to our future financial statements. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we have recorded an estimated income tax expense of $57.4 million to account for the lower tax rate impact to our existing deferred tax assets. In addition, we have recorded an estimated $3.6 million charge related to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015. We expect the Tax Act will have a favorable impact to tax expense and earnings per share beginning in 2018.\nWe may also access the capital markets to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity offerings on an opportunistic basis. Our principal uses of capital for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were homebuilding acquisitions, land purchases, lot development, home construction, operating expenses, payment of debt service, income taxes, investments in joint ventures, stock repurchases and the payment of various liabilities. In addition, net proceeds from our equity offerings during the year were used to repurchase our Principal Equityholders' indirect interest in TMHC. Cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle, and can differ substantially from reported earnings. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash expenditures for land acquisitions, on and off-site development, construction of model homes, general landscaping and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outflows prior to recognition of earnings.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as adjusted for the tax reform impact for the periods presented (See - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d above): \n \u2022 Mortgage warehouse facilities; \n \u2022 Project-level financing (including non-recourse loans); \n\nLand Purchase and Land Option Contracts\nInterest Income, net\nFavorable market conditions coupled with increased demand for new housing has led to lower cancellation rates across all of our regions for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, our use of prequalification criteria through TMHF and robust earnest money deposits helped us manage our cancellation rate across the Company compared to the prior year.\nNet Sales Orders\nSales Order Backlog\nNet income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $206.6 million and $1.69, respectively. Net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $171.0 million and $1.38. The increase in net income and earnings per share from the prior year is attributable to an increase in margin dollars as a result of the increase in both the number of homes closed and average selling price of homes closed.\nOur effective tax rate was 50.3% and 34.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Tax Act made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate that that may be payable over eight years.\nWe typically grant our homebuyers certain sales incentives, including cash discounts, incentives on options included in the home, option upgrades, and seller-paid financing or closing costs. Incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction in the sales price of the home, and home closings revenue is shown net of discounts. We also receive rebates from certain vendors and these rebates are accounted for as a reduction to cost of home closings.\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2021 Senior Notes.\nInterest income, net includes interest earned on cash balances offset by interest incurred but not capitalized on our long-term debt and other borrowings. Interest income, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was consistent.\nOur approach in allocating capital and managing our land portfolio has been to acquire assets that have attractive characteristics, including good access to schools, shopping, recreation and transportation facilities. In connection with our overall land inventory management process, our management team reviews these considerations, as well as other financial metrics, in order to decide the highest and best use of our capital.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nSenior Notes:\nGeneral Overview\nWe had no such transactions for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nWe have certain deductible amounts under our workers' compensation, automobile and general liability insurance policies, and we record expense and liabilities for the estimated costs of potential claims for construction defects. We also generally require our sub-contractors and design professionals to indemnify us and provide evidence of insurance for liabilities arising from their work, subject to certain limitations. Beneva Indemnity Company ( Beneva\u201d), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, provides insurance coverage for construction defects discovered up to ten years following the closing of a home, premises operations risk and property coverage. We accrue for the expected costs associated with the deductibles and self-insured amounts under our various insurance policies based on historical claims, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, and potential for recovery of costs from insurance and other sources. The estimates are subject to significant variability due to various factors, such as claim settlement patterns, litigation trends and the length of time in which a construction defect claim might be made after the closing of a home.\nReal Estate Inventory Valuation and Costing\nThe life cycle of the community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of unentitled or entitled land, continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale, construction and delivery of homes. Actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as finished lots.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home closings revenue, were 3.6% and 3.3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was attributable to increased headcount and other investments we have made for future business optimization, as well as the acquisition we completed in 2016.\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The prior year balance included higher accruals for contingent consideration relating to our acquisitions and pre-acquisition costs on abandoned land projects.\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities was $7.5 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change was primarily due to the timing of our unconsolidated joint venture openings. We had two additional unconsolidated joint ventures fully active during 2016 compared to the prior year.\ncould not obtain access on terms that are as favorable. Our partners in these joint ventures historically have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to sites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large or expensive land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners' capital. In certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures, we enter into loan agreements, whereby one of our subsidiaries will provide the lenders with customary guarantees, including completion, indemnity and environmental guarantees subject to usual non-recourse terms.\nRevenue Recognition\nAverage Active Selling Communities\nOn March 5, 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes\u201d).\nNet income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $176.7 million and $1.47, respectively. As adjusted net income from continuing operations and as adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $237.6 million and $1.98, respectively. Net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $206.6 million and $1.69, respectively. Adjusting for the tax reform impact, the increase in net income and earnings per share from the prior year is attributable to an increase in margin dollars as a result of the increase in both the number of homes closed and average selling price of homes closed.\n \u2022 During 2017, our operations were located in eight states with 297 average active communities. \n(1) In January 2018, we completed two additional equity offerings which included the purchase of 7.6 million shares of our Class B Common Stock from our Principal Equityholders for approximately $200.0 million.\nThe following is a summary of our mortgage subsidiary warehouse borrowings:\nTMM Holdings is a parent guarantor of certain of our debt facilities. The financial information of TMHC is substantially identical to the financial performance and operations of TMM Holdings except for certain costs associated with maintaining a public company status and Class A common stock, which are attributable to TMHC.\nWest:\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. As a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, we have recorded a material charge to earnings in the period ending December 31, 2017. See Note 13 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nTotal backlog units and total sales value increased by 11.7% and 11.1% at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016, respectively. The increase in backlog units and total sales value is primarily a result of the combination of increased sales orders and lower cancellation rates.\n \u2022 Performance, payment and completion surety bonds, and letters of credit; and \nTMHC Compared to TMM Holdings\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities was $8.8 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the number of active unconsolidated joint ventures and the timing of openings. We had six unconsolidated joint ventures which were open and active for the full year ended December 31, 2017. In the prior year, we had five unconsolidated joint ventures which were active all year with the sixth unconsolidated joint venture opening in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCentral:\n\nInterest income, net includes interest earned on cash balances offset by interest incurred but not capitalized on our long-term debt and other borrowings. Interest income, net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was consistent.\nConsolidated:\nWe generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes. However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending on market opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, land closings revenue increased by $20.8 million as we were able to capitalize on certain market conditions relative to our long-term strategic assets. The sales represent legacy land that we held for either appreciation or tax purposes. During 2016, the tax holding period for certain land assets expired, preserving certain tax benefits, thus resulting in our significant land sales.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe average selling price increased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The markets in this region are showing continued strength as evidenced by a 24.3% increase in sales pace. With our increased focus on turn times and our limited product availability as a result of the increase in the number of community close outs, the number of net homes sold decreased slightly compared to the prior year. The value of the net sales orders increased by 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 36.8% and 34.3%, respectively, for the 2016 year as compared to the 2015 year primarily due to the current year results encompassing a full period of home closings from all of our acquired divisions, whereas 2015 included results only for JEH and the acquired divisions of Orleans for a partial year. Additionally, we organically grew our markets through community openings which resulted in increased homes closed. Certain economic market improvements, as well as favorable homebuyer reception of new products and new communities, contributed to the increase in net home closings revenue in 2016 compared to 2015. The average selling price decreased by 1.8% as a result of the newly acquired markets over the past year in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, and Raleigh where average selling prices were lower than our legacy markets.\nOperating Cash Flow Activities\nAverage active selling communities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by 3.9% when compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the West region which experienced higher sales orders in the first half of 2017 resulting in an increase in the number of community close outs. The slight decrease in average active communities aligns with our focus for growth to be primarily driven by improving sales volume rather than only increasing average active communities.\n(1) Excludes hedging gain/loss\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nWest:\nThe Tax Act made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax of foreign earnings at a reduced rate that may be, payable over eight years.\n\nOur as adjusted effective tax rate excluding the impacts of the Tax Act was 33.2% and 34.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our effective rate for both years was affected by a number of\nHome closings gross margin percentage decreased to 20.2% from 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an overall shift in our product mix from our higher margin homes in our Florida divisions to our newly acquired divisions, which have slightly lower margin percentages. An impairment charge of approximately $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, in our Chicago division negatively impacted our home closings gross margin results. Furthermore, the effects of purchase accounting stemming from these business combinations has also negatively impacted home closings gross margin in this region.\n \u2022 As a result of the Tax Act, we have recorded a non-cash provisional income tax expense of $57.4 million to account for the revaluation of our existing deferred tax assets due to the lower tax rate and we have recorded an estimated $3.6 million charge which may be payable over eight years related to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015. \nSegment Home Closings Gross Margins\n \u2022 Cash generated from operations. \nOur reserves are based on factors that include an actuarial study for historical and anticipated claims, trends related to similar product types, number of home closings, and geographical areas. We also provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration lenders. We regularly review the reasonableness and adequacy of our reserves and make adjustments to the balance of the preexisting reserves to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available. Self-insurance and warranty reserves are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nResults of Operations\nOur mortgage capture rate represents the percentage of our homes sold to a home purchaser that utilized a mortgage and for which the borrower obtained such mortgage from TMHF or one of our preferred third party lenders. The decrease in our capture rate is primarily due to increased competition for new home mortgages.\n\nDebt Instruments\nThe following table sets forth our effective tax rate as adjusted for the tax reform impact for the periods presented (See - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d above):\nLiquidity\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2017\n\nWest:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 15.2% and 15.0%, respectively, in 2017 as compared to 2016. A significant portion of the increase in units and sales value is driven by our Houston market which has shown improvements from the past two years' soft economic environment, despite the impacts of Hurricane Harvey which occurred during the third quarter of 2017. Other markets within this region continue to strengthen their performance and contributed to the overall increase in units and dollars for the segment as well.\ncontinue to strengthen as noted by the increase in net sales orders as discussed above, however we could see pressure on labor and material costs begin to have an impact on costs during 2018.\n \u2022 We were recognized and awarded as one of the Best Places to Work by Glassdoor. \nThe number of net homes sold remained relatively flat and sales value of homes increased by 14.1%, respectively, primarily due to an increase in average active selling communities in our California markets. The average selling price of net homes sold increased by 13.5% as a result of our performance in several of our markets in California and Phoenix which experienced price increases due to increased consumer demand.\n2023 Senior Notes and Redemption of the 2020 Notes\nIn response to the Tax Act, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allows for the recording provisional amounts during a one year measurement period\u201d similar to that used when accounting for business combinations, if the Company has a reasonable estimate of the impact but the accounting is not yet complete. The measurement period is deemed to have ended in either one calendar year or when the Company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act, whichever is earlier.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the change between periods was the 2016 acquisition of Acadia for $52.8 million.\nEast:\nCentral:\nLand Closings Revenue\nMortgage Operations Revenue\nWe finance our operations through the following:\n\n (1) As of December 31, 2017 total debt outstanding included $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Senior Notes, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Senior Notes, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Notes, $118.8 million of mortgage borrowings by TMHF, no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility, and $139.5 million of loans and other borrowings. Scheduled maturities of certain loans and other borrowings as of December 31, 2017 reflect estimates of anticipated lot take-downs associated with such loans. \n\nHome closings gross margin percentage remained relatively consistent for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Despite the economic uncertainty regarding the oil industry, which occurred throughout 2016 and thereby negatively impacting the number of homes closed, the Central region maintained home closings gross margin percentage through sales price increases in markets other than Houston.\nIncome Tax Provision\n \u2022 Sales pace for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 2.4 compared to 2.0 for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n \nWe generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes. However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending on market opportunities. Land closings revenue was $17.1 million and $64.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The prior year was significantly higher as we were able to capitalize on certain market conditions relative to our long-term strategic assets. The sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 represent legacy land that we held for either appreciation or tax purposes.\nNet Income\nCentral:\n\nLetters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Financial Guarantees\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 16.4% and 23.8%, respectively for the 2016 year as compared to the 2015 year. The increase in units was primarily driven by our Phoenix market which continued to grow as a result of job growth and a lower cost of living when compared to other markets. Our Phoenix and California markets contributed to the increase in home closing revenue, net as a result of increased average selling price\n\n \u2022 For the last three consecutive years, we were awarded America's Most Trusted Home Builder\u00ae by Lifestory Research. \nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains certain springing\u201d financial covenants, requiring us and our subsidiaries to comply with a maximum debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60 to 1.00 and a minimum consolidated tangible net worth level of at least $1.6 billion. The financial covenants would be in effect for any fiscal quarter during which any (a) loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are outstanding during the last day of such fiscal quarter or on more than five separate days during such fiscal quarter or (b) undrawn letters of credit (except to the extent cash collateralized) issued under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount greater than $40.0 million or unreimbursed letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility are outstanding on the last day of such fiscal quarter or for more than five consecutive days during such fiscal quarter.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants including limitations on incurrence of liens, dividends and other distributions, asset dispositions and investments in entities that are not guarantors, limitations on prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and limitations on fundamental changes. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default, subject to applicable grace periods, including for nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts, violation of covenants (including financial covenants, subject to the exercise of an equity cure), incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect, cross default and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material monetary judgments, ERISA events with material adverse effect, actual or asserted invalidity of material guarantees and change of control. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n (1) The mortgage warehouse borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are collateralized by $187.0 million and $233.2 million, respectively, of mortgage loans held for sale, which comprise the balance of mortgage receivables, and $1.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of cash, which is restricted cash on our balance sheet. \nWe offer a limited warranty to cover various defects in workmanship or materials, including structural defects. We may also facilitate a longer warranty in certain markets or to comply with regulatory requirements. Warranty reserves are recorded as each home closes in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected future costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods. Our warranty is not considered a separate deliverable in each sale arrangement, so it is accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies.\u201d In accordance with ASC 450, warranties that are not separately priced are generally accounted for by accruing the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation. Thus, the warranty would not be considered a separate deliverable in the arrangement since it is not priced apart from the home. As a result, we accrue the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation in accordance with ASC 450 at the time a home closes, as a component of cost of home closings.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The significant accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are critical accounting policies and are described below.\nOur principal business is residential homebuilding and the development of lifestyle communities with operations geographically focused in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, and Texas. We serve a wide array of consumer groups from coast to coast, including first time, move-up, luxury, and active adult buyers, building single family attached and detached homes. Our homebuilding company operates under our Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes brand names. We also have operations which provide mortgage services to customers through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, Taylor Morrison Home Funding ( TMHF\u201d), and title services through our wholly owned title services subsidiary, Inspired Title Services, LLC ( Inspired Title\u201d). Our business is organized into multiple homebuilding operating components, and a mortgage operations component, all of which are managed as four reportable segments: East, Central, West and Mortgage Operations, as follows:\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740-10, Income Taxes,\u201d we evaluate our deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction, including the benefit from net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards by tax jurisdiction, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. Companies must assess, using significant judgments, whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the length of statutory carryforward periods, experience with operating losses and experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives.\nEast:\n \u2022 We sold and closed nearly 12.0% and 9.0%, respectively, more homes during 2017 compared to 2016. \n\n2021 Senior Notes\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 3.7% and 9.4%, respectively, for the 2017 year as compared to the 2016 year. The increases are primarily driven by higher net sales in the first half of the year as compared to the same period in the prior year in our Phoenix and Northern California markets. The 5.6% increase in average selling price is also driven by the Phoenix and Northern California markets as a result of strong consumer demand within these areas.\nWe enter into land purchase and option contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes in the ordinary course of business. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding land purchase and lot option contracts of $405.3 million for 5,037 lots. We are obligated to close the transaction under our land purchase contracts. However, our obligations with respect to the option contracts are generally limited to the forfeiture of the related non-refundable cash deposits and/or letters of credit provided to obtain the options.\n\nOther Expense, net\nThe net expense related to the Tax Act recorded during the period ended December 31, 2017, also includes an estimated $3.6 million expense from the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian business in 2015. The Tax Act imposes a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) of certain foreign subsidiaries to their 10% U.S. shareholders (regardless of whether such E&P is distributed) at a rate of 15.5% for U.S. corporate shareholders to the extent E&P does not exceed the U.S. shareholder's aggregate foreign cash position (as defined in the Tax Act) and 8% for E&P in excess of such cash position. The resulting tax may be payable over eight years. The mandatory tax is partially offset by foreign tax credits generated by cash taxes that our Canadian subsidiaries previously paid. To determine the amount of the foreign repatriation tax, we determined, in addition to other factors, the amount of E&P of the subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. The provisional expense is the Company's best estimate of the foreign repatriation tax at this time, however it is subject to change in the future as we are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the tax.\nOur Mortgage Operations segment provides mortgage lending through our subsidiary, TMHF, and title service through our subsidiary, Inspired Title. The following details the number of loans closed, net income per closed loan, the aggregate value, capture rate, and average FICO on our loans for the following periods:\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets", "item_7_text": "The following table summarizes our letters of credit and surety bonds as of the dates indicated:\nHome Closings Revenue\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur consolidated cancellation rate decreased to 13.6% from 13.9% year over year. The primary driver for the decrease in the cancellation rate is our Houston divisions which are normalizing after twelve months of elevated rates. In addition, our use of prequalification criteria through TMHF and robust earnest money deposits helped us manage our cancellation rate across the Company and increase our mortgage capture rate compared to the prior year.\nDisposal activities consist of the disposal of Monarch Corporation, our former Canadian business ( Monarch\u201d), and gain on foreign currency hedge in January 2015, loss on extinguishment of debt and the acquisition of JEH Homes (\"JEH\") in the second quarter of 2015, the acquisition of three divisions of Orleans Homes (\"Orleans\") in the third quarter of 2015, and the acquisition of Acadia Homes (\"Acadia\") in January 2016. For all periods presented, the operating results of Monarch are included in discontinued operations and historical periods have been recast to show the effects of our segment realignment, which was effective December 31, 2015. In addition to the impact of the matters discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A of this Annual Report, our future results could differ materially from our historical results due to these changes.\n \u2022 At December 31, 2017, we owned and controlled approximately 38,000 lots. \nWe intend to maintain a consistent approach to land positioning within our regions, markets and communities in the foreseeable future in an effort to concentrate a greater amount of our land inventory in attractive areas. We also intend to continue to combine our land development expertise with our homebuilding operations to increase the flexibility of our business and to optimize our margin performance. From time to time, we may sell land in our communities if we believe it is best for our overall operations. We do not expect such sales to have a significant effect on our overall results, but they may impact our overall gross margins.\nfactors, the most significant of which included state income taxes, the establishment of reserves for uncertain tax positions, adjustments to state net operating losses, changes in valuation allowances, and preferential treatment of certain deductions and energy credits relating to homebuilding activities.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we realigned our homebuilding operating divisions within our existing segments based on geographic location and management's long term strategic plans, however our reporting segments remained unchanged. As a result, all historical periods presented in the segment information have been reclassified to give effect to this segment realignment.\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 16.6% from 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. The majority of the markets within this region experienced an increase in their margins through sales price increases to offset the increase in land, development and construction costs.\nInterest Income, net\nInsurance Costs, Self-Insurance Reserves and Warranty Reserves\n (1) Net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers, net of cancellations. \n\n\nConsolidated:\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nInvestments in Land Development and Homebuilding Joint Ventures or Unconsolidated Entities\nIn December 2014, we entered into a derivative financial instrument in the form of a foreign currency forward. The derivative financial instrument hedged our exposure to the Canadian dollar in conjunction with the disposition of the Monarch business. The final settlement of the derivative financial instrument occurred on January 30, 2015, and a gain in the amount of $30.0 million was recorded in gain on foreign currency forward in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n(1) As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was $200 million total capacity of letters of credit available under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nPrior to December 1, 2023, the 2024 Senior Notes are redeemable at a price equal to 100% plus a make-whole\u201d premium for payments through December 1, 2023 (plus accrued and unpaid interest). Beginning on December 1, 2023, the 2024 Senior Notes are redeemable at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\nWe calculate as adjusted net income from continuing operations from U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations by adding the tax reform impact due to the revaluation of deferred assets and liabilities and mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. Such expenses only occurred for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the Tax Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017. As adjusted earnings per common share utilizes the as adjusted net income from continuing operations measure within the numerator of the earnings per share calculation. As adjusted income tax provision and As adjusted effective tax rate reflect our income tax provision adjusted to exclude the impact of tax reform. We calculate net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio by dividing (i) total debt, less unamortized debt issuance costs and mortgage warehouse borrowings, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, by (ii) total capitalization (the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders' equity). Management uses all of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operational and economic performance and to set targets for performance-based compensation on a consolidated basis to compare to prior years which did not include such significant tax reform. We also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry. We believe as adjusted net income from continuing operations, as adjusted earnings per common share, as adjusted income tax provision and as adjusted effective tax rate are relevant and useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the performance of our operations without the significant effect of the Tax Act. Because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry, we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason. These measures are considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance.\nrebates from our regional and national vendor program. The net decrease in costs of home closings partially contributed to the increase in home closings gross margin percentage. In addition, geographical mix within the region further contributed to the overall increase for 2017.\nIndustry Overview and Business Strategy\nSegment Home Closings Gross Margins\nThe 2021 Senior Notes are redeemable at scheduled redemption prices, currently at 102.625%, of their principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\n(1) Net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers, net of cancellations.\n \u2022 Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2017 our net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio of 25.8%.  Operational\n\nCash Flow Activities\nCentral:\nWest:\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio (See - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d above):\nWe capitalize qualifying interest costs to inventory during the development and construction periods. Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales when the related inventory is delivered or when the related inventory is charged to cost of sales.\nWe believe the housing market is on a positive trajectory of recovery, driven by certain positive economic and demographic factors, including decreasing unemployment, strong home values, improving household balance sheets, declines in new and existing for-sale home inventory and low interest rates. While we were encouraged by certain positive and improved trends during 2017, several challenges still exist, such as lingering under employment concerns, stagnation in real wages and real or perceived personal wealth, national and global economic uncertainty and uncertainty around the interest rate environment. We are additionally challenged by shortages in the labor supply, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, and volatility in energy prices. Nevertheless, we believe we are in an upward business cycle.\nThe 2021 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2021. The 2021 Senior Notes are guaranteed by TMM Holdings, Taylor Morrison Holdings, Inc., Taylor Morrison Communities II, Inc. and their homebuilding subsidiaries (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d), which are all subsidiaries directly or indirectly of TMHC. The 2021 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights. The indenture for the 2021 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit (i) the making of investments, (ii) the payment of dividends and the redemption of equity and junior debt, (iii) the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (iv) asset dispositions, (v) mergers and similar corporate transactions, (vi) the incurrence of liens, (vii) prohibitions on payments and asset transfers among the issuers and restricted subsidiaries and (viii) transactions with affiliates, among others. The indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes contains customary events of default. If we do not apply the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales within specified deadlines, we will be required to offer to repurchase the 2021 Senior Notes at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest) with such proceeds. We are also required to offer to repurchase the 2021 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) upon certain change of control events.\nHome closings revenue is recorded using the completed-contract method of accounting at the time each home is delivered, title and possession are transferred to the buyer, we have no significant continuing involvement with the home, risk of loss has transferred, the buyer has demonstrated sufficient investment in the property, and the receivable, if any, from the homeowner or escrow agent is not subject to future subordination.\nEast:\nSales Order Cancellations \nOur consolidated home closings gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 18.2% from 18.4% compared to the prior year. Amortization of capitalized interest benefited our overall margins as we have experienced a decrease in our interest incurred from the redemption, in May 2015, of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 ( the 2020 Notes\u201d) and issuance, in April 2015, of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023. Partially offsetting this benefit, in 2016, we increased closings of aged finished inventory which negatively impacted margins as such homes typically have lower margins than to-be-built homes and a higher cost of capital due to longer carry times. Purchase accounting also negatively impacted our consolidated gross margin percentage in 2016 when compared to 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements as of December 31, 2017\nCentral:\nLand Closings Revenue\nOn April 16, 2015, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Senior Notes\u201d). The 2023 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights. The net proceeds of the offering, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the entire remaining principal amount of the 2020 Notes on May 1, 2015, at a redemption price of 105.813% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption. As a result of the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $33.3 million during the second quarter of 2015, which included the payment of the redemption premium and write-off of net unamortized deferred financing fees.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities and Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nOther Expense, net\n\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), we have provided information in this Annual Report relating to as adjusted net income from continuing operations,\u201d as adjusted earnings per common share,\u201d as adjusted income tax provision,\u201d as adjusted effective tax rate,\u201d and net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio.\u201d\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 18.4% from 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Several markets within the Central region experienced a decrease in construction costs and an increase in\n \u2022 We ended 2017 with $1.7 billion in sales order backlog. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to cash used in financing activities of $117.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the change between periods was the repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility in 2016. We did not have any borrowings or repayments on our Revolving Credit Facility in 2017.\n\nSales Order Cancellations\n\nWe had no such transactions for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \n \u2022 We generated $3.9 billion in total revenue and $3.8 billion in home closings revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year's home closings revenue. \n \u2022 Since January 2017, we have completed seven public offerings for an aggregate of 80.2 million shares of our Class A Common Stock, using all of the net proceeds therefrom to repurchase our Principal Equityholders' indirect interest in TMHC. In January 2018, we also purchased an additional 7.6 million shares of our Class B Common Stock from our Principal Equityholders. As a result of the series of offerings and repurchases, the Principal Equityholders ownership decreased to 31.1% at December 31, 2017 and to zero by January 31, 2018. \n(1) Sales order backlog represents homes under contract for which revenue has not yet been recognized at the end of the period (including homes sold but not yet started). Some of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in future cancellations.\nOther immaterial changes were also made to the structure of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee the 2021, 2023 and 2024 Senior Notes.\n \u2022 On January 26, 2018 we amended the maturity date of our $500 million Revolving Credit Facility from April 2019 to January 2022 allowing incremental financial flexibility. \nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 19.7% and 23.1%, respectively, for 2017 as compared to 2016. All markets within this region contributed to the increase in both units and dollars as a result of higher net sales in the first half of the year as compared to the same period in the prior year. Certain economic market improvements, as well as favorable homebuyer reception of our products and our communities, contributed to the increase in net home closings revenue.\n \u2022 Net income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $176.7 million and $1.47 compared to $206.6 million and $1.69 for the year ended December 31, 2016. \nRevolving Credit Facility\nEquity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities\n\n \u2022 Borrowings under our revolving credit facility; \nSales, Commissions and Other Marketing Costs\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2024 Senior Notes.\nTotal backlog units and total sales value increased by 6.8% and 10.0% at 2016 year end as compared to the 2015 year end, respectively. The increase in backlog units is primarily as a result of the combination of increased sales orders and a decrease in our cancellation rate. The increase in total sales value is directionally consistent with the 2.9% increase in the average selling price which is a result of higher average selling prices for net sales orders.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home closings revenue, decreased period over period to 3.4% from 3.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease was attributable to increased home closings revenue in addition to gaining leverage on existing infrastructure to maintain stable operating costs.\nWe have issued stock options, performance based restricted stock units and non-performance based restricted stock units, which we account for in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d The fair value for stock options is measured and estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognized evenly over the vesting period of the options. Performance-based restricted stock units are measured using the closing price on the date of grant and expensed using a probability of attainment calculation which determines the likelihood of achieving the performance targets. Non-performance-based restricted stock units are time based awards and measured using the closing price on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nMortgage Warehouse Borrowings\nOur net cash provided by operating activities was $386.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $372.6 million provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale as a result of selling more loans offset by a smaller decrease in real estate inventory year over year. The decreases in mortgage loans held for sale and real estate inventory were partially offset by lower net income before allocation to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nNet Income\nEast:\nSales Order Backlog\nGain on Foreign Currency Forward\nIncome Tax Provision\n\nOur mortgage capture rate represents the percentage of our homes sold to a home purchaser that utilized a mortgage and for which the borrower obtained such mortgage from TMHF or one of our preferred third party lenders.\nEquity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities\nEast:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes decreased by 8.5% and 6.0%, respectively, whereas the average selling price increased by 2.6%. Despite the decrease in the annual results for this region, we experienced fourth quarter improvements in 2016 in the Central region with increases in net sales orders and total sales value by 13.1% and 12.5%, respectively, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. While slower job growth and a decline in relocations to Houston compared to previous years impacted the year-over-year performance, the divisions in the Central region experienced increased average selling prices for 2016 as well as declining cancellation rates.\nWe believe that we can fund our current and foreseeable liquidity needs for the next 12 months from:\n\n\nEast:\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $11.9 million and $11.6 million, respectively. The majority of the expense for both periods relates to earn-out activity, captive insurance claims costs, financing fees on our Revolving Credit Facility, and pre-acquisition costs on abandoned land projects.\n2017 Highlights and Recent Developments\nStock Based Compensation\n \u2022 Average sales price of homes closed was $473,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. \nWe are involved in joint ventures with related and unrelated third parties for homebuilding and development activities. We use the equity method of accounting for entities over which we exercise significant influence but do not have a controlling interest over the operating and financial policies of the investee. For unconsolidated entities in which we function as the managing member, we have evaluated the rights held by our joint venture partners and determined that they have substantive participating rights that preclude the presumption of control. For joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses is included in equity in income of unconsolidated entities when earned and distributions are credited against its investment in the joint venture when received. These joint ventures are recorded in investments in unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nSales commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, increased slightly period over period to 7.0% from 6.9% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This was primarily a result of our increase in the number of open communities in 2016. Our new communities typically have higher sales and marketing costs during their early stages of sales due to various start up costs.\nNet Sales Orders\nSales commissions and other marketing costs, as a percentage of home closings revenue, decreased period over period to 6.8% from 7.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease is primarily driven by efficiencies we have achieved as a result of previous investments we have made in our sales and marketing functions. In addition, the prior year period had higher sales and marketing costs as a result of our acquired divisions and an increase in new communities which typically have incremental startup costs during their early stages.\nDuring 2017, tax legislation was enacted which made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a mandatory deemed repatriation tax of foreign earnings at a reduced rate, that may be payable over eight years. Our effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2017 includes one-time tax expense charges to account for the lower tax rate impact to our existing deferred tax assets and the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015. In 2018, we expect to have a lower annual effective tax rate due to the reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate.\n(1) Cancellation rate represents the number of canceled sales orders divided by gross sales orders.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLoans Payable and Other Borrowings\n \u2022 Adjusting for the effects of the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $237.6 million or 15.0% higher than the prior year. Similarly, diluted earnings per share adjusted for tax reform effects in 2017 was $1.98 compared to $1.69 for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 13 - Income taxes for discussion regarding Tax Act effects. \nWest:\n2024 Senior Notes\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding senior unsecured notes (collectively, the Senior Notes\u201d), as of December 31, 2017.\nLoans payable and other borrowings as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 consist of project-level debt due to various land sellers and seller financing notes from current and prior year acquisitions. Project-level debt is generally secured by the land that was acquired and the principal payments generally coincide with corresponding project lot sales or a principal reduction schedule. Loans payable bear interest at rates that ranged from 0% to 8% at December 31, 2017 and 2016. We impute interest for loans with no stated interest rates.\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 20.6% from 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of product and geographic mix. All divisions in the East experienced an increase in the number of homes closed and several of our markets also experienced an increase in the average sales price, which led to an increase in home closings gross margin. However, certain markets within the region experienced an increase in land development cost which partially offset the increase in home closings revenue net, causing a moderate increase in home closings gross margin percent.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, we have recorded a discrete net tax expense of $61 million related to impacts related to the Tax Act. The net expense includes our estimated $57.4 million expense related to the write-down of our existing deferred tax assets to reflect the newly enacted U.S. federal tax rate, in accordance with SAB 118. The provisional expense is the Company's best estimate of the deferred tax asset write-down at this time. However, the estimate may be impacted by our calculation of additional adjustments made to federal temporary differences arising from a tax accounting method change filed with the IRS and the state tax effect of these additional adjustments.\nPrior to January 15, 2023, the 2023 Senior Notes are redeemable at a price equal to 100% plus a make-whole\u201d premium for payments through January 15, 2023 (plus accrued and unpaid interest). Beginning January 15, 2023, the 2023 Senior Notes are redeemable at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest).\nOur Mortgage Operations segment provides mortgage lending through our subsidiary, TMHF, and title service through our subsidiary, Inspired Title. The following details the number of loans closed, net income per closed loan, the aggregate value, capture rate, and average FICO on our loans for the following periods:\n (2) Estimated interest expense amounts for debt outstanding at the respective contractual interest rates, the weighted average of which was 5.5% as of December 31, 2017. \n(1) Sales order backlog represents homes under contract for which revenue has not yet been recognized at the end of the period (including homes sold but not yet started). Some of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in future cancellations.\n\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net remained relatively flat for the 2017 year as compared to the 2016 year primarily as a result of Hurricane Harvey, which affected the Houston market during the third quarter of 2017. As a result of the hurricane, some closings were pushed to future periods. Houston along with the other markets within the region\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2017, our total liquidity was $1.0 billion, including $573.9 million in cash. \nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 46.6% and 51.7%, respectively, primarily due to the acquisitions of JEH, Acadia Homes ( Acadia\u201d) and Orleans, which contributed to the increase in communities. The change in the total sales value was a result of a higher number of units, primarily attributable to an increase in average active selling communities in the majority of our markets. In addition, the results for 2016 represent full period net sales orders from our acquired divisions, whereas the 2015 balances include data for the acquired divisions only for the periods since their respective acquisitions. The average selling price of net homes sold increased throughout the region for 2016 due to product mix.\nLoan origination fees (including title fees, points, and closing costs) are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. All of the loans TMHF originates are sold to third party investors within a short period of time (typically within 15-20 business days) on a non-recourse basis. Gains and losses from the sale of mortgages are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 860-20, Sales of Financial Assets.\u201d Because TMHF does not have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, we derecognize the mortgage loans at time of sale, based on the difference between the selling price and carrying value of the related loans upon sale, recording a gain/loss on sale in the period of sale. Also, we enter into IRLCs to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time. These instruments meet the definition of a derivative and the realized and unrealized gain and loss from the IRLCs are included in mortgage operations revenue/expenses.\nSales, Commissions and Other Marketing Costs\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2023 Senior Notes.\nOur financial and operational highlights for the year ended December 31, 2017 and recent developments subsequent to the year end are summarized below:\nWe assess the recoverability of our land inventory in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d We review our real estate inventory for indicators of impairment by community during each reporting period. If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we first perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if the carrying value of the assets in that community exceeds the undiscounted cash flows. Generally, if the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated undiscounted cash flows, then the assets are deemed to be impaired and are recorded at fair value as of the assessment date. Our determination of fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model which includes projections and estimates relating to sales prices, construction costs, sales pace, and other factors. Changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis, and actual results may also differ from our assumptions.\nThe Management's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The primary factors that affect the comparability of our results of operations are the impacts of the Tax Act, our acquisitions, and disposal activities.\nThe 2024 Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2024. The 2024 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee the 2021 and 2023 Senior Notes. The 2024 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and are not subject to registration rights. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions similar to the 2023 Senior Notes. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes contains events of default that are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2021 and 2023 Senior Notes. The change of control provisions in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes.\nGeneral\n(1) Excludes hedging gain/loss\nHome Closings Revenue\nWest:\nAt December 31, 2017, our $500.0 million Revolving Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on April 12, 2019. On January 26, 2018, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from April 12, 2019 to January 26, 2022.\nHome closings gross margin percentage increased to 16.7% from 16.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Several markets within this region experienced an increase in the number of homes closed, average sales price, and homes closing revenue, net. During 2017, we experienced efficiencies from procurement and operational enhancements, which also contributed to the increase in home closings gross margin. However, we also experienced an increase in land development costs of the homes closed in 2017 compared to those closed in 2016, which partially offset our enhancements.\n\nLand closings revenue is recognized when title is transferred to the buyer, we have no significant continuing involvement, the buyer has demonstrated sufficient investment in the property sold and the receivable, if any, from the buyer is not subject to future subordination. If the buyer has not made an adequate investment in the property, the profit on such sale is deferred until these conditions are met.\n \u2022 Our various series of senior notes; \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur net income per closed loan increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased margins as a result of improvements in the gain on sale of loans due to better investor pricing from our mandatory commitments model. In addition, 2015 was negatively impacted by an increase in overhead related to increasing our in-house underwriting platform in preparation for shifting to agency originations and additional regulation\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal initial capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation,\u201d we have concluded that when we enter into an option or purchase agreement to acquire land or lots and pay a non-refundable deposit, a VIE may be created because we are deemed to have provided subordinated financial support that will absorb some or all of an entity's expected losses if they occur. If we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we will consolidate the VIE in our Consolidated Financial Statements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned under option agreements within our inventory balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOur net income per closed loan, excluding the derivative asset, increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the increase in the average loan amount which is a result of the increase in average selling price of homes closed.\nFinancing Cash Flow Activities\nFor purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants for any fiscal quarter, the Revolving Credit Facility provides that we may exercise an equity cure by issuing certain permitted securities for cash or otherwise recording cash contributions to our capital that will, upon the contribution of such cash to the borrower, be included in the calculation of consolidated tangible net worth and consolidated total capitalization. The equity cure right is exercisable up to twice in any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and up to five times overall.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Results\nThe number of homes closed decreased by 1.3% for the 2016 year as compared to the 2015 year primarily as a result of our Houston market. Higher price point homes in this market have been affected the most by oil industry economic factors in Texas in 2016. While the high price point homes were the most affected in home closings units, the majority of the markets within this region experienced price appreciation, which contributed to the region's 1.6% increase in home closings revenue, net in 2016 and a 3.0% increase in average selling price compared to 2015.\nThe 2023 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2023. The 2023 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the same Guarantors that guarantee the 2021 Senior Notes. The indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. The indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes contains events of default that are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes. The change of control provisions in the indenture governing the 2023 Senior Notes are similar to those contained in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes, but a credit rating downgrade must occur in connection with the change of control before the repurchase offer requirement is triggered for the 2023 Senior Notes.\nAverage Active Selling Communities\nWe participate in strategic land development and homebuilding joint ventures with related and unrelated third parties. The use of these entities, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or\nCentral:\n (1) Cancellation rate represents the number of canceled sales orders divided by gross sales orders. \nIn May 2015, we redeemed the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 105.813% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the date of the redemption. As a result of the redemption, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $33.3 million, which included the payment of the redemption premium and write-off of net unamortized deferred financing fees.\nInventory consists of raw land, land under development, homes under construction, completed homes, and model homes, which are stated at cost. In addition to direct carrying costs, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes, and related development costs that benefit the entire community, such as field construction supervision and related direct overhead. Home construction costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales at home closing using the specific identification method. Land acquisition, development, interest, real estate taxes and overhead are allocated to homes and units using the relative sales value method. These costs are capitalized to inventory from the point development begins to the point construction is completed. Changes in estimated costs to be incurred in a community are generally allocated to the remaining homes on a prospective basis. For those communities that have been temporarily closed or development has been discontinued, we do not allocate interest or other costs to the community's inventory until activity resumes.\nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\nMortgage Operations\n \u2022 Cash generated from operations; and \nThe table below summarizes our total cash and liquidity as of the dates indicated:\nOn April 16, 2013, we issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Senior Notes\u201d).\nMortgage Operations\nThe following is a summary of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 19.3% and 20.2%, respectively, in 2017 as compared to 2016. Product and geographic mix among all divisions within the region contributed to the overall increase in in net homes sold and sales value. Certain divisions experienced an increase in sales price along with an increase in net homes sold, while others maintained their sales price and increased the number of net homes sold.\nAverage active selling communities increased 19.3%, primarily in the East region due to the acquisitions of JEH Homes ( JEH\u201d) in April 2015 and three divisions of Orleans Homes ( Orleans\u201d) in July 2015. In addition, we experienced community growth in existing divisions in our Central and West regions such as Houston, Austin and divisions within our California market. We also opened new communities and closed out existing communities throughout all of our legacy markets.\n(1) 2017 income tax provision, effective tax rate and earnings per common share data include impacts of the Tax Act, which was an aggregate $61.0 million expense.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur effective tax rate was 34.3% and 34.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The effective rate for both years was affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which included state income taxes, the establishment of reserves for uncertain tax positions, changes in valuation allowances, and preferential treatment of certain deductions and energy credits relating to homebuilding activities.\nUS Tax Reform\nThe Tax Act has a material impact to our current financial statements and we expect the Tax Act will have a material impact to our future financial statements. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we have recorded an estimated income tax expense of $57.4 million to account for the lower tax rate impact to our existing deferred tax assets. In addition, we have recorded an estimated $3.6 million charge related to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015. We expect the Tax Act will have a favorable impact to tax expense and earnings per share beginning in 2018.\nWe may also access the capital markets to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity offerings on an opportunistic basis. Our principal uses of capital for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were homebuilding acquisitions, land purchases, lot development, home construction, operating expenses, payment of debt service, income taxes, investments in joint ventures, stock repurchases and the payment of various liabilities. In addition, net proceeds from our equity offerings during the year were used to repurchase our Principal Equityholders' indirect interest in TMHC. Cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle, and can differ substantially from reported earnings. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash expenditures for land acquisitions, on and off-site development, construction of model homes, general landscaping and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outflows prior to recognition of earnings.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as adjusted for the tax reform impact for the periods presented (See - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d above): \n \u2022 Mortgage warehouse facilities; \n \u2022 Project-level financing (including non-recourse loans); \n\nLand Purchase and Land Option Contracts\nInterest Income, net\nFavorable market conditions coupled with increased demand for new housing has led to lower cancellation rates across all of our regions for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, our use of prequalification criteria through TMHF and robust earnest money deposits helped us manage our cancellation rate across the Company compared to the prior year.\nNet Sales Orders\nSales Order Backlog\nNet income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $206.6 million and $1.69, respectively. Net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $171.0 million and $1.38. The increase in net income and earnings per share from the prior year is attributable to an increase in margin dollars as a result of the increase in both the number of homes closed and average selling price of homes closed.\nOur effective tax rate was 50.3% and 34.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Tax Act made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate that that may be payable over eight years.\nWe typically grant our homebuyers certain sales incentives, including cash discounts, incentives on options included in the home, option upgrades, and seller-paid financing or closing costs. Incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction in the sales price of the home, and home closings revenue is shown net of discounts. We also receive rebates from certain vendors and these rebates are accounted for as a reduction to cost of home closings.\nThere are no financial maintenance covenants for the 2021 Senior Notes.\nInterest income, net includes interest earned on cash balances offset by interest incurred but not capitalized on our long-term debt and other borrowings. Interest income, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was consistent.\nOur approach in allocating capital and managing our land portfolio has been to acquire assets that have attractive characteristics, including good access to schools, shopping, recreation and transportation facilities. In connection with our overall land inventory management process, our management team reviews these considerations, as well as other financial metrics, in order to decide the highest and best use of our capital.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nSenior Notes:\nGeneral Overview\nWe had no such transactions for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nWe have certain deductible amounts under our workers' compensation, automobile and general liability insurance policies, and we record expense and liabilities for the estimated costs of potential claims for construction defects. We also generally require our sub-contractors and design professionals to indemnify us and provide evidence of insurance for liabilities arising from their work, subject to certain limitations. Beneva Indemnity Company ( Beneva\u201d), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, provides insurance coverage for construction defects discovered up to ten years following the closing of a home, premises operations risk and property coverage. We accrue for the expected costs associated with the deductibles and self-insured amounts under our various insurance policies based on historical claims, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, and potential for recovery of costs from insurance and other sources. The estimates are subject to significant variability due to various factors, such as claim settlement patterns, litigation trends and the length of time in which a construction defect claim might be made after the closing of a home.\nReal Estate Inventory Valuation and Costing\nThe life cycle of the community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of unentitled or entitled land, continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale, construction and delivery of homes. Actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as finished lots.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home closings revenue, were 3.6% and 3.3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was attributable to increased headcount and other investments we have made for future business optimization, as well as the acquisition we completed in 2016.\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The prior year balance included higher accruals for contingent consideration relating to our acquisitions and pre-acquisition costs on abandoned land projects.\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities was $7.5 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change was primarily due to the timing of our unconsolidated joint venture openings. We had two additional unconsolidated joint ventures fully active during 2016 compared to the prior year.\ncould not obtain access on terms that are as favorable. Our partners in these joint ventures historically have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to sites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large or expensive land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners' capital. In certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures, we enter into loan agreements, whereby one of our subsidiaries will provide the lenders with customary guarantees, including completion, indemnity and environmental guarantees subject to usual non-recourse terms.\nRevenue Recognition\nAverage Active Selling Communities\nOn March 5, 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes\u201d).\nNet income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $176.7 million and $1.47, respectively. As adjusted net income from continuing operations and as adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $237.6 million and $1.98, respectively. Net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $206.6 million and $1.69, respectively. Adjusting for the tax reform impact, the increase in net income and earnings per share from the prior year is attributable to an increase in margin dollars as a result of the increase in both the number of homes closed and average selling price of homes closed.\n \u2022 During 2017, our operations were located in eight states with 297 average active communities. \n(1) In January 2018, we completed two additional equity offerings which included the purchase of 7.6 million shares of our Class B Common Stock from our Principal Equityholders for approximately $200.0 million.\nThe following is a summary of our mortgage subsidiary warehouse borrowings:\nTMM Holdings is a parent guarantor of certain of our debt facilities. The financial information of TMHC is substantially identical to the financial performance and operations of TMM Holdings except for certain costs associated with maintaining a public company status and Class A common stock, which are attributable to TMHC.\nWest:\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. As a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, we have recorded a material charge to earnings in the period ending December 31, 2017. See Note 13 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nTotal backlog units and total sales value increased by 11.7% and 11.1% at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016, respectively. The increase in backlog units and total sales value is primarily a result of the combination of increased sales orders and lower cancellation rates.\n \u2022 Performance, payment and completion surety bonds, and letters of credit; and \nTMHC Compared to TMM Holdings\nEquity in income of unconsolidated entities was $8.8 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the number of active unconsolidated joint ventures and the timing of openings. We had six unconsolidated joint ventures which were open and active for the full year ended December 31, 2017. In the prior year, we had five unconsolidated joint ventures which were active all year with the sixth unconsolidated joint venture opening in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCentral:\n\nInterest income, net includes interest earned on cash balances offset by interest incurred but not capitalized on our long-term debt and other borrowings. Interest income, net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was consistent.\nConsolidated:\nWe generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes. However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending on market opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, land closings revenue increased by $20.8 million as we were able to capitalize on certain market conditions relative to our long-term strategic assets. The sales represent legacy land that we held for either appreciation or tax purposes. During 2016, the tax holding period for certain land assets expired, preserving certain tax benefits, thus resulting in our significant land sales.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe average selling price increased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The markets in this region are showing continued strength as evidenced by a 24.3% increase in sales pace. With our increased focus on turn times and our limited product availability as a result of the increase in the number of community close outs, the number of net homes sold decreased slightly compared to the prior year. The value of the net sales orders increased by 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 36.8% and 34.3%, respectively, for the 2016 year as compared to the 2015 year primarily due to the current year results encompassing a full period of home closings from all of our acquired divisions, whereas 2015 included results only for JEH and the acquired divisions of Orleans for a partial year. Additionally, we organically grew our markets through community openings which resulted in increased homes closed. Certain economic market improvements, as well as favorable homebuyer reception of new products and new communities, contributed to the increase in net home closings revenue in 2016 compared to 2015. The average selling price decreased by 1.8% as a result of the newly acquired markets over the past year in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, and Raleigh where average selling prices were lower than our legacy markets.\nOperating Cash Flow Activities\nAverage active selling communities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by 3.9% when compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the West region which experienced higher sales orders in the first half of 2017 resulting in an increase in the number of community close outs. The slight decrease in average active communities aligns with our focus for growth to be primarily driven by improving sales volume rather than only increasing average active communities.\n(1) Excludes hedging gain/loss\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nWest:\nThe Tax Act made comprehensive reforms to the United States tax code, including a decrease to the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax of foreign earnings at a reduced rate that may be, payable over eight years.\n\nOur as adjusted effective tax rate excluding the impacts of the Tax Act was 33.2% and 34.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our effective rate for both years was affected by a number of\nHome closings gross margin percentage decreased to 20.2% from 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an overall shift in our product mix from our higher margin homes in our Florida divisions to our newly acquired divisions, which have slightly lower margin percentages. An impairment charge of approximately $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, in our Chicago division negatively impacted our home closings gross margin results. Furthermore, the effects of purchase accounting stemming from these business combinations has also negatively impacted home closings gross margin in this region.\n \u2022 As a result of the Tax Act, we have recorded a non-cash provisional income tax expense of $57.4 million to account for the revaluation of our existing deferred tax assets due to the lower tax rate and we have recorded an estimated $3.6 million charge which may be payable over eight years related to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian operations in 2015. \nSegment Home Closings Gross Margins\n \u2022 Cash generated from operations. \nOur reserves are based on factors that include an actuarial study for historical and anticipated claims, trends related to similar product types, number of home closings, and geographical areas. We also provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration lenders. We regularly review the reasonableness and adequacy of our reserves and make adjustments to the balance of the preexisting reserves to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available. Self-insurance and warranty reserves are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nResults of Operations\nOur mortgage capture rate represents the percentage of our homes sold to a home purchaser that utilized a mortgage and for which the borrower obtained such mortgage from TMHF or one of our preferred third party lenders. The decrease in our capture rate is primarily due to increased competition for new home mortgages.\n\nDebt Instruments\nThe following table sets forth our effective tax rate as adjusted for the tax reform impact for the periods presented (See - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d above):\nLiquidity\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2017\n\nWest:\nThe number of net homes sold and sales value of homes increased by 15.2% and 15.0%, respectively, in 2017 as compared to 2016. A significant portion of the increase in units and sales value is driven by our Houston market which has shown improvements from the past two years' soft economic environment, despite the impacts of Hurricane Harvey which occurred during the third quarter of 2017. Other markets within this region continue to strengthen their performance and contributed to the overall increase in units and dollars for the segment as well.\ncontinue to strengthen as noted by the increase in net sales orders as discussed above, however we could see pressure on labor and material costs begin to have an impact on costs during 2018.\n \u2022 We were recognized and awarded as one of the Best Places to Work by Glassdoor. \nThe number of net homes sold remained relatively flat and sales value of homes increased by 14.1%, respectively, primarily due to an increase in average active selling communities in our California markets. The average selling price of net homes sold increased by 13.5% as a result of our performance in several of our markets in California and Phoenix which experienced price increases due to increased consumer demand.\n2023 Senior Notes and Redemption of the 2020 Notes\nIn response to the Tax Act, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allows for the recording provisional amounts during a one year measurement period\u201d similar to that used when accounting for business combinations, if the Company has a reasonable estimate of the impact but the accounting is not yet complete. The measurement period is deemed to have ended in either one calendar year or when the Company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act, whichever is earlier.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the change between periods was the 2016 acquisition of Acadia for $52.8 million.\nEast:\nCentral:\nLand Closings Revenue\nMortgage Operations Revenue\nWe finance our operations through the following:\n\n (1) As of December 31, 2017 total debt outstanding included $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Senior Notes, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Senior Notes, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Notes, $118.8 million of mortgage borrowings by TMHF, no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility, and $139.5 million of loans and other borrowings. Scheduled maturities of certain loans and other borrowings as of December 31, 2017 reflect estimates of anticipated lot take-downs associated with such loans. \n\nHome closings gross margin percentage remained relatively consistent for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Despite the economic uncertainty regarding the oil industry, which occurred throughout 2016 and thereby negatively impacting the number of homes closed, the Central region maintained home closings gross margin percentage through sales price increases in markets other than Houston.\nIncome Tax Provision\n \u2022 Sales pace for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 2.4 compared to 2.0 for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n \nWe generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes. However, in some locations where we act as a developer, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels or areas designated for school or government use, which we typically sell to commercial developers or municipalities, as applicable. We also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply on larger tracts of land. Land and lot sales occur at various intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the revenue and gross margin from land closings will fluctuate from period to period, depending on market opportunities. Land closings revenue was $17.1 million and $64.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The prior year was significantly higher as we were able to capitalize on certain market conditions relative to our long-term strategic assets. The sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 represent legacy land that we held for either appreciation or tax purposes.\nNet Income\nCentral:\n\nLetters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Financial Guarantees\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 16.4% and 23.8%, respectively for the 2016 year as compared to the 2015 year. The increase in units was primarily driven by our Phoenix market which continued to grow as a result of job growth and a lower cost of living when compared to other markets. Our Phoenix and California markets contributed to the increase in home closing revenue, net as a result of increased average selling price\n\n \u2022 For the last three consecutive years, we were awarded America's Most Trusted Home Builder\u00ae by Lifestory Research. \nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains certain springing\u201d financial covenants, requiring us and our subsidiaries to comply with a maximum debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60 to 1.00 and a minimum consolidated tangible net worth level of at least $1.6 billion. The financial covenants would be in effect for any fiscal quarter during which any (a) loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are outstanding during the last day of such fiscal quarter or on more than five separate days during such fiscal quarter or (b) undrawn letters of credit (except to the extent cash collateralized) issued under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount greater than $40.0 million or unreimbursed letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility are outstanding on the last day of such fiscal quarter or for more than five consecutive days during such fiscal quarter.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants including limitations on incurrence of liens, dividends and other distributions, asset dispositions and investments in entities that are not guarantors, limitations on prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and limitations on fundamental changes. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default, subject to applicable grace periods, including for nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts, violation of covenants (including financial covenants, subject to the exercise of an equity cure), incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect, cross default and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material monetary judgments, ERISA events with material adverse effect, actual or asserted invalidity of material guarantees and change of control. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n (1) The mortgage warehouse borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are collateralized by $187.0 million and $233.2 million, respectively, of mortgage loans held for sale, which comprise the balance of mortgage receivables, and $1.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of cash, which is restricted cash on our balance sheet. \nWe offer a limited warranty to cover various defects in workmanship or materials, including structural defects. We may also facilitate a longer warranty in certain markets or to comply with regulatory requirements. Warranty reserves are recorded as each home closes in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected future costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods. Our warranty is not considered a separate deliverable in each sale arrangement, so it is accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies.\u201d In accordance with ASC 450, warranties that are not separately priced are generally accounted for by accruing the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation. Thus, the warranty would not be considered a separate deliverable in the arrangement since it is not priced apart from the home. As a result, we accrue the estimated costs to fulfill the warranty obligation in accordance with ASC 450 at the time a home closes, as a component of cost of home closings.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The significant accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are critical accounting policies and are described below.\nOur principal business is residential homebuilding and the development of lifestyle communities with operations geographically focused in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, and Texas. We serve a wide array of consumer groups from coast to coast, including first time, move-up, luxury, and active adult buyers, building single family attached and detached homes. Our homebuilding company operates under our Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes brand names. We also have operations which provide mortgage services to customers through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, Taylor Morrison Home Funding ( TMHF\u201d), and title services through our wholly owned title services subsidiary, Inspired Title Services, LLC ( Inspired Title\u201d). Our business is organized into multiple homebuilding operating components, and a mortgage operations component, all of which are managed as four reportable segments: East, Central, West and Mortgage Operations, as follows:\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740-10, Income Taxes,\u201d we evaluate our deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction, including the benefit from net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards by tax jurisdiction, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. Companies must assess, using significant judgments, whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not\u201d standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the length of statutory carryforward periods, experience with operating losses and experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives.\nEast:\n \u2022 We sold and closed nearly 12.0% and 9.0%, respectively, more homes during 2017 compared to 2016. \n\n2021 Senior Notes\nThe number of homes closed and home closings revenue, net increased by 3.7% and 9.4%, respectively, for the 2017 year as compared to the 2016 year. The increases are primarily driven by higher net sales in the first half of the year as compared to the same period in the prior year in our Phoenix and Northern California markets. The 5.6% increase in average selling price is also driven by the Phoenix and Northern California markets as a result of strong consumer demand within these areas.\nWe enter into land purchase and option contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes in the ordinary course of business. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding land purchase and lot option contracts of $405.3 million for 5,037 lots. We are obligated to close the transaction under our land purchase contracts. However, our obligations with respect to the option contracts are generally limited to the forfeiture of the related non-refundable cash deposits and/or letters of credit provided to obtain the options.\n\nOther Expense, net\nThe net expense related to the Tax Act recorded during the period ended December 31, 2017, also includes an estimated $3.6 million expense from the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the sale of our Canadian business in 2015. The Tax Act imposes a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) of certain foreign subsidiaries to their 10% U.S. shareholders (regardless of whether such E&P is distributed) at a rate of 15.5% for U.S. corporate shareholders to the extent E&P does not exceed the U.S. shareholder's aggregate foreign cash position (as defined in the Tax Act) and 8% for E&P in excess of such cash position. The resulting tax may be payable over eight years. The mandatory tax is partially offset by foreign tax credits generated by cash taxes that our Canadian subsidiaries previously paid. To determine the amount of the foreign repatriation tax, we determined, in addition to other factors, the amount of E&P of the subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings.
