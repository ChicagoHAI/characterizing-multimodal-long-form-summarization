Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included below in Item 8 of this report and the Risk Factors included above in Part I, Item 1A of this report. In addition, investors should review the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" above.\nOverview\nNMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH), a Delaware corporation incorporated in May 2011 provides private mortgage guaranty insurance (which we refer to as \"mortgage insurance\" or \"MI\") through its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries. Our primary insurance subsidiary, National Mortgage Insurance Corporation (NMIC), is a qualified MI provider on loans purchased by the GSEs and is licensed in all 50 states and D.C. to issue MI. Our reinsurance subsidiary, National Mortgage Reinsurance Inc One (Re One), solely provides reinsurance to NMIC on certain loans insured by NMIC, as described in Note 14, Statutory Information - Reinsurance, below. NMIH's wholly owned subsidiary, NMI Services, Inc. (NMIS), began offering outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol \"NMIH.\"\nMI protects mortgage lenders from all or a portion of default-related losses on residential mortgage loans made to home buyers who generally make down payments of less than 20% of the home's purchase price. By protecting lenders and investors from credit losses, we help facilitate the availability of mortgages to prospective, primarily first-time, U.S. home buyers, thus promoting homeownership while protecting lenders and investors against potential losses related to a borrower's default. MI also facilitates the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market, most of which are sold to the GSEs. We are one of seven companies in the United States who offer MI. Our business strategy is to continue to gain market share with our principal focus on writing insurance on high quality, low down payment residential mortgages in the U.S.\nWe began writing business in April 2013. We had 964 Master Policy holders by the end of 2015, compared to 735 at the end of 2014. Of those Master Policy holders, 51.9% were delivering business in 2015, compared to 37.7% delivering business in 2014. We had total IIF of $19.1 billion and total RIF of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2015, compared to total IIF of $8.1 billion and total RIF of $894.7 million as of December 31, 2014. Of total IIF as of December 31, 2015, we had $14.8 billion of primary IIF and $4.2 billion of pool IIF, compared to $3.4 billion of primary IIF and $4.7 billion of pool IIF as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, our primary RIF was $3.6 billion compared to primary RIF of $801.6 million as of December 31, 2014. Pool RIF was $93.1 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nWe discuss below our results of operations for the periods presented, as well as the conditions and trends that have impacted or are expected to impact our business, including customer development, new business writings, the composition of our insurance portfolio, and other factors that we expect to impact our results.\nConditions and Trends Impacting Our Business\nCustomer Development\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1, \"Business - Customers,\" our sales and marketing strategy is focused on increasing market share from existing customers and attracting new mortgage originator customers in the U.S. that fall into two primary categories, which we refer to as \"National Accounts\" and \"Regional Accounts.\"\nThe lenders in the combined residential mortgage market who control the MI decision are currently comprised of three groups:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Top 10, primarily National Accounts, representing approximately 19% of the MI market;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Next 30, a combination of National and Regional Accounts, representing approximately 17% of the MI market; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Approximately 1,500, primarily Regional Accounts, representing the remainder of the MI market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Since April 2013, we have increased our customer base, and we expect to continue to acquire new customers. As of December 31, 2015, we had active customer relationships with 22 of the top 40 lenders and expect to develop additional active customer relationships. We believe our most significant growth opportunity is within the the large and fragmented market of Regional Accounts, which includes some of the top correspondent lenders. As of December 31, 2015, our active customer relationships give us access to over 83% of the correspondent origination market. In addition to adding new customers, we believe existing customers will begin to allocate more of their business to us for placement of our MI.\nOur ability to continue to make progress attaining and retaining customers is primarily dependent on the following factors:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintain approved status and relationships with National Accounts who purchase loans from Regional Accounts. Retaining these approvals as an authorized MI provider enables Regional Accounts to sell loans with insurance from us to those National Accounts through their correspondent channels. Consequently, these relationships are critical to continuing to grow our business with Regional Accounts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintain our connections and continue our progress in connecting with leading third-party loan origination systems utilized by Regional Accounts. This will allow the Regional Accounts who originate loans using these third-party loan origination systems to automatically select us as an MI provider within those platforms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> New Insurance Written, Insurance in Force and Premiums\nNMIC's primary insurance may be written on a flow basis, in which loans are insured in individual, loan-by-loan transactions, or on an aggregated basis, in which each loan in a portfolio of loans is individually insured in a single transaction.\nMI may also be written in a pool policy, where a group of loans (or pool) are insured under one contract. Pool insurance may have a stated aggregate loss limit for a pool of loans and may also have a deductible under which no losses are paid by the insurer until losses on the pool of loans exceed the deductible.\nWe set premiums at the time a policy is issued based on our expectations regarding likely performance over the term of coverage. We offer BPMI and LPMI options. Premium rates are based on the risk characteristics of each insured loan and the capital required to support particular products. Capital charges are governed by the updated PMIERs and for LPMI policies, will increase in 2016. See \"- GSE Oversight,\" below.\nWe offer monthly, annual and single premium payment plans. Policies written on a single premium basis are paid through a single, upfront payment, the majority of which is initially deferred as unearned premium and earned over the policy term. For monthly policies, premiums are earned and collected each month as coverage is provided.\nThe table below shows primary and pool IIF, NIW and premiums written and earned. Single NIW and IIF includes policies written on an aggregated and flow basis.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary and pool IIF and NIW\n</td> <td>As of and for the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>IIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NIW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NIW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NIW\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,957,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,989,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,400,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,416,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single\n</td> <td>7,866,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,434,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,968,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,035,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary\n</td> <td>14,823,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,424,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,369,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,451,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pool\n</td> <td>4,237,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,721,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,089,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,171,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,061,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,424,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,091,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,451,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,251,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,333,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary and pool premiums written and earned\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>45,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrimary NIW in 2015 increased 260% from the prior year as a result of an increase in customers with approved master policies as well as an increase in our primary flow business for the year ended December 31, 2015. Single NIW in 2015 increased 216% over the prior year due to greater lender demand for our single premium LPMI products. Single premiums written on an aggregated basis were 20% of total NIW in 2015, down from 46% in the prior year. Monthly NIW in 2015 increased 323% over the prior year as a result of new account activation and continued penetration of existing customer accounts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net premiums written of $114.2 million and premiums earned of $45.5 million, compared to net premiums written of $34.0 million and premiums earned of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had net premiums written of $3.5 million and premiums earned of $2.1 million. Premiums written and earned in a year are generally influenced by:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NIW, which is the new IIF (aggregate principal amount of the mortgages) that are insured during a period. Many factors affect NIW, including, among others, the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations (which tend to be generated to a greater extent in purchase financings as compared to refinancings) and the competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages, which includes primarily competition from the FHA and other private mortgage insurers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the product mix of our book of business, which includes recurring monthly premiums earned for monthly policies and the recognition of premiums earned from the amortization of our single premiums over the policies' lives.

Upon cancellation of a policy, all premium that is non-refundable is immediately earned, and any refundable premium is returned to the policyholder. Cancellations due to refinancings are affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on our IIF. Refinancings are also affected by current home values compared to values when the loans became insured and the terms on which mortgage credit is available. To a lesser extent, cancellations also result from claim payments, as we return any premium received from the servicer after the date the insured mortgage defaults. Finally, cancellations are affected by home price appreciation, which may give homeowners the right to cancel the MI on their loans. Based on current market conditions, we expect our MI policies to have a persistency rate of between 80% and 85%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>premium rates, which are based on the risk characteristics of the loans insured, the percentage of coverage on the loans, competition from other mortgage insurers and general industry conditions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements. The only reinsurance agreements we currently have in place are between NMIC and Re One, and they are for the sole purpose of allowing NMIC to comply with certain statutory requirements regarding the amount of risk an MI company may retain on any single MI policy.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In our industry, a \"book\" is a group of loans that an MI company insures in a particular period, normally a calendar year. In general, the majority of any underwriting profit (i.e., the earned premium revenue minus claims and expenses, excluding investment income) that a book generates occurs in the early years of the book, with the largest portion of the underwriting profit for that book realized in the first year. This pattern generally occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years of the book, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments), and by increasing losses. The earnings we record and the cash flow we receive vary based on the type of MI product and premium plan our customers select.\nIn recent years, the level of competition within the private MI industry has been intense and is not expected to diminish. Lenders have requested discounts from mortgage insurers with greater frequency, particularly with respect to LPMI single premium policies. A significant percentage of our total business to date has consisted of single premium policies, some of which has been written at a discounted rate, which may impact our premium yields in the near term. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented new LPMI and BPMI rates, which we expect will improve premium yields on our future NIW and have the effect of increasing the amount of monthly NIW as a percentage of our total mix over time.\nPortfolio Statistics\nThe table below shows primary NIW, IIF, RIF, policies in force, the weighted average coverage and loans in default, by quarter, for the last five quarters.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary portfolio trends\n</td> <td>As of and for the quarter ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New insurance written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,546,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,632,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,548,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,696,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,692,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance in force (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,823,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,601,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,190,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,835,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,369,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk in force (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,586,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,553,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,715,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,145,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>801,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policies in force (1)\n</td> <td>63,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average coverage (2)\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans in default (count)\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk in force on defaulted loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Reported as of the end of the period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>End of period RIF divided by IIF.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We utilize certain risk principles that form the basis of how we underwrite and originate primary NIW. We manage our portfolio credit risk by using several loan eligibility matrices which prescribe the maximum LTV, minimum borrower credit score, maximum loan size, property type and occupancy status of loans that we will insure. Our loan eligibility matrices, as well as all of our detailed underwriting guidelines, are contained in our Underwriting Guideline Manual that is publicly available on our website. Our eligibility criteria and underwriting guidelines are designed to mitigate the layered risk inherent in a single insurance policy. \"Layered risk\" refers to the accumulation of borrower, loan and property risk. For example, we have higher credit score and lower maximum allowed LTV requirements for riskier property types, such as investor properties, compared to owner-occupied properties.\nWe monitor the concentrations of various risk attributes in our insurance portfolio. Generally, insuring loans made to borrowers with higher credit scores tends to result in a lower frequency of claims than with loans made to borrowers with lower credit scores. As of December 31, 2015, our primary IIF and RIF were made up of approximately 64.3% and 64.1%, respectively, of loans to borrowers who had credit scores at or above 740. Our primary weighted average FICO for NIW in the year ended December 31, 2015 was 752. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, all loans in our insurance portfolio were full documentation loans, and approximately 4% of our RIF was on loans above 95% LTV. Our primary weighted average LTV for NIW in the year ended December 31, 2015 was 91%.\nThe table below reflects a summary of the change in total primary IIF for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary IIF\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IIF, beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,369,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NIW\n</td> <td>12,424,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,451,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cancellations and other reductions\n</td> <td>(969,894\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(243,421\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IIF, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,823,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,369,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur persistency rate is the percentage of policies in force that remains on our books after any twelve-month period. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, changes in persistency rates can have a significant impact on our earnings. The persistency rate on our portfolio was 84.1% at December 31, 2015. In recent quarters, we have experienced high volumes of single premium policy cancellations driven by refinance activity, which has contributed to lower persistency than generally expected.

We manage geographic concentration risk by establishing targets and limits for new origination mix and/or portfolio limits. If warranted, we would also establish restrictions in certain geographic markets; although, we currently do not have any geographic market restrictions in place. We expect that our insurance origination mix by region will be consistent with the overall distribution of mortgage originations in the U.S. that require mortgage insurance.\nOn an ongoing and recurring basis, we evaluate changing market conditions to determine if it is appropriate to establish, tighten, loosen or eliminate lending restrictions established by geographic area. The evaluation is expected to include factors such as historical performance and the historical performance of other market participants, forward-looking projections for key risk drivers, estimated impact on loss performance and existing portfolio concentrations. Consistent with our governance processes, the geographic concentrations will be monitored on an ongoing basis and changes to market restrictions will be reviewed and approved.\nThe following tables show the distribution by state of our IIF and RIF, for both primary and pool insurance. As of December 31, 2015, our IIF and RIF continues to be relatively more concentrated in California, primarily as a result of the location and timing of the acquisition of new customers. With the broadening of our customer base, the concentration of primary IIF and RIF in California has declined from over 16.0% for both as of the end of 2014, to 13.8% and 12.9%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The distribution of risk across the states as of December 31, 2015 is not necessarily representative of the geographic distribution we expect in the future. As we add new customers and receive greater allocations of business from our existing customers, we expect we will have increased flexibility to manage our state concentration levels.\nTable 151:

To date, our loss experience is developing at a slower pace than historical trends have shown, primarily as a result of the relatively strong economy, which has led to a more favorable housing market and lower interest rates.\nCybersecurity\nAs a participant in the mortgage lending and MI industries, we rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide and expand our products and services. We have established and implemented security measures, controls and procedures to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed and/or stored in such systems. We periodically employ third parties to evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, controls and procedures. In addition, we have established a business continuity plan that is designed to allow our business to continue to operate in the midst of certain disruptive events, including any disruptions to our information technology systems. We also have an incident response plan that is designed to address information security incidents, including breaches of our information technology systems. Despite these safeguards, disruptions to and breaches of our information technology systems are possible and may negatively impact our business.\nWe maintain cyber errors and omissions coverage to limit our exposure if an incident occurs. This insurance provides coverage for (i) claims related to, among other things, unauthorized network or computer access, unintentional disclosure or misuse of personally identifiable information in our possession, unintentional failure to disclose a breach and (ii) certain costs related to privacy notification, crisis management, cyber extortion, data recovery and business interruption.\nGSE Oversight\nThe GSEs are the principal purchasers of mortgages insured by MI companies. As a result, the nature of the private MI industry in the U.S. is driven in large part by the requirements and practices of the GSEs.\nIn the second quarter of 2015, the FHFA published final updated PMIERs that went into effect on December 31, 2015 (Effective Date) for existing, GSE-approved private mortgage insurers, i.e., Approved Insurers. (Italicized terms have the same\nmeaning that such terms have in the PMIERs, as described below.) The PMIERs establish operational, business, remedial and financial requirements applicable to Approved Insurers. The new financial requirements prescribe a risk-based capital methodology whereby the amount of capital required to be held against each insured loan is determined based on certain risk characteristics, such as FICO, vintage (year of origination), performing vs. non-performing, LTV and other risk features. A capital charge is calculated for each insured loan based on its risk profile. In general, higher quality loans carry lower capital charges.\nUnder the PMIERs financial requirements, Approved Insurers must maintain available assets that equal or exceed minimum required assets, which is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $400 million or (ii) a total risk-based required asset amount. The risk-based required asset amount is a function of the risk profile of an Approved Insurer's net RIF, calculated by applying on a loan-by-loan basis certain risk-based factors derived from tables set out in the PMIERs to the net RIF. The risk-based required asset amount for primary insurance is subject to a floor of 5.6% of total, performing, primary RIF, and the risk-based required asset amount for pool insurance considers both the factors in the tables and the net remaining stop loss for each pool insurance policy. The PMIERs financial requirements also increase the amount of available assets that must be held by an Approved Insurer for loans originated on or after January 1, 2016 that are insured under LPMI policies not subject to automatic termination under the HOPA.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, NMIH raised additional capital by entering into the Credit Agreement to obtain the Term Loan in the amount of $150 million. Concurrently with the closing of the Credit Agreement, NMIH borrowed $150 million from the facility and subsequently made contributions to NMIC of $145.4 million of cash and securities during the fourth quarter to support growth in NMIC's RIF and meet the final PMIERs requirements as of the Effective Date. As a result, as of December 31, 2015, NMIC had sufficient assets to meet the PMIERs financial requirements and we expect to certify to the GSEs by March 1, 2016 that NMIC fully complies with the PMIERs.\nGoing forward, by April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. Moreover, NMIC has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of its failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements. We will continue to monitor our compliance with the PMIERs going forward.\nCapital Position of Our Insurance Subsidiaries\nIn addition to GSE-imposed capital requirements, NMIC is also subject to state regulatory minimum capital requirements based on its insured RIF. While formulations of this minimum capital may vary in each jurisdiction, the most common measure allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1. As our insurance writings grow and our RIF increases, our RTC ratio will increase and NMIC's RTC metrics will become more important to an evaluation of its capital needs to support future business writings.\nAs of December 31, 2015, NMIC's primary RIF was approximately $3.6 billion representing insurance on a total of 63,948 policies in force, and pool RIF was approximately $93.1 million, representing insurance on a total of 18,955 loans. Based on NMIC's reported total statutory capital of $395 million at December 31, 2015, NMIC's RTC ratio was 8.4:1, significantly below the regulatory maximum RTC thresholds. Similarly, Re One had total statutory capital of $29 million at December 31, 2015, with a RTC ratio of 12.6:1. As of December 31, 2015, under PMIERs financial requirements, NMIC's minimum required assets were approximately $249.8 million and its available assets were approximately $431.4 million.\nState insurance regulators also have the authority to make changes to capital requirements. The NAIC has formed a working group to develop and recommend more robust regulations governing mortgage insurance, including, among other things, strengthened capital requirements, underwriting standards, claims practices and market conduct. We, along with other MI companies, are working with the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Working Group of the Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC (Working Group). The Working Group will determine and make a recommendation to the Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC as to what changes the Working Group believes are necessary to the solvency and market practices regulation of MI companies, including changes to the Mortgage Guaranty Insurers Model Act (Model #630). We have provided feedback to the Working Group since early 2013. The Working Group's discussions are ongoing and the ultimate outcome of these discussions and any potential actions taken by the NAIC cannot be predicted at this time. If the Working Group proposes that the NAIC adopt more stringent capital requirements, this could ultimately lead to NMIC being obligated to hold more capital for its insured business than we are required to holder under PMIERs, which would reduce our profitability compared to the profitability we expect under the existing capital requirements.\nIn July 2015, Standard & Poor's (S&P) Ratings Services assigned its \"BBB-\" financial strength and long-term counter-party credit ratings to NMIC. At the same time, S&P assigned its \"BB-\" long-term counter-party credit rating to NMIH. S&P's outlook for both companies is \"stable.\"\nIn November 2015, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) assigned a financial strength rating of \"Ba2\" to NMIC. Also at that time, Moody's assigned a B2 rating to the $150 million Term Loan held by NMIH. Moody's outlook for both companies is \"stable.\"\nCompetition\nThe MI industry is highly competitive and currently consists of seven private mortgage insurers, including NMIC, as well as governmental agencies like the FHA and the VA. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business - Sales and Marketing and Competition - Competition.\"\nPrivate MI\nIn recent years, the MI industry has been in a state of transition. There are now seven MI companies serving the mortgage market. Given this dynamic, we expect that the pressure for industry participants to grow or maintain their market share will continue in the coming years. Our competitors' respective shares of the private MI market at September 30, 2015 ranged from single percentage points penetration to a high of approximately 24%.\nCompetition with FHA\nAlthough there has been broad policy consensus toward the need for private capital to play a larger role and government credit risk to be reduced in the U.S. housing finance system, recent action by the current administration has made it difficult to predict whether the market share of governmental agencies such as the FHA and VA will recede to historical levels. On January 26, 2015, the FHA reduced some of its single-family annual mortgage insurance premiums. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact from this premium reduction on our business. It is difficult to predict what, if any, material impact this premium reduction will have in the future as there are factors beyond premium rate that influence a lender's decision to choose private MI over FHA insurance, including among others, the FHA's loan eligibility requirements and loan size limits and the relative ease of use of private MI products compared to FHA products. However, we believe our pricing continues to be more attractive than the FHA's pricing for a substantial majority of borrowers with credit and loan characteristics similar to those whose loans we insure.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated statements of operations\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>(In Thousands, except for share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in unearned premiums\n</td> <td>(68,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,622\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,446\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>45,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>7,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains\n</td> <td>831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>53,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance claims and claims expenses\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting and operating expenses\n</td> <td>80,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>81,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) from change in fair value of warrant liability\n</td> <td>1,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from settlement of warrants\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(2,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(27,793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51,292\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,184\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,386\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48,906\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55,184\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net premiums written of $114.2 million compared to net premiums written of $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We had net premiums written for our primary mortgage insurance products of $109.3 million, $28.6 million, and $1.7 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The principal driver of the increase in primary premiums written in 2014 and 2015 was the continued growth of our policies in force and the significant development of our customer base. As of December 31, 2015, we had 63,948 primary certificates in force and 18,955 pool certificates in force, compared to 14,603 primary certificates in force and 20,573 pool certificates in force as of December 31, 2014.\nOur increases in unearned premiums year-over-year for the periods presented resulted from consecutive annual increases in single premiums written in 2014 and 2015. Net premiums earned in 2014 and 2015 also increased from the prior years, as a result of increases in new business, continued earnings from business written in prior years, and early cancellations related to single premium policies.\nGiven our growth during 2015, we believe that a quarter-over-quarter comparison of net premiums written is more meaningful than comparing net premiums written year-over-year. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we had net premiums written of $45.6 million and net premiums earned of $16.9 million, compared to net premiums written of $35.4 million and net premiums earned of $12.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we had net monthly premiums written and earned of $9.6 million compared to $7.3 million for the third quarter of 2015.\nWe had net single premiums written and earned of $34.8 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to net single premiums written and earned of $26.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2015. Net single premiums earned increased as a result of an increase in single premiums written during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, as well as from cancellations on LPMI singles, which are non-refundable and fully earned upon cancellation. Net pool premiums written and earned of $1.2 million for both during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was down slightly quarter over quarter due to the pay off of approximately 341 loans in the pool from September 30, 2015. We have not written significant annual premiums through December 31, 2015.\nWe began investing our cash during the first quarter of 2013 and continued to invest and re-balance our portfolio in the second and third quarters of 2013. As a result, our net investment income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Additionally, net investment income was higher for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of an increase in our consolidated securities portfolio, from $336.5 million at December 31, 2014 to $559.2 million at December 31, 2015. Net realized investment gains also increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the re-balancing of our portfolio among a mix of investment categories.\nExpenses\nOur expenses have historically been related to business development activities. Although we expect our year-over-year expenses to increase as we grow our business, we ultimately expect that the majority of our operating expenses will be relatively fixed in the long term. When our business is mature, we expect an expense ratio (expenses to premiums earned) to fall into the industry range of 20% to 25%. Until our business matures, our expense ratio is expected to be significantly higher than this range given the low levels of premium written compared to our \"fixed\" costs customary to operating a mortgage insurance company.\nInsurance claims and claims expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of an increase in our NODs from December 31, 2014, in addition to our payment of two claims paid during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEmployee compensation represents the majority of our operating expense, which includes both cash and share-based compensation. Our underwriting and operating expenses grew year-over-year primarily as the result of hiring new employees and expanding our operations and sales activities. Our headcount grew from 189 at December 31, 2014 to 243 at December 31, 2015. Underwriting and operating expenses also include costs related to policy acquisition, technology, professional services and facilities.\nWe incurred interest expense of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the Term Loan entered into during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nWe recorded no income tax for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $2.4 million of income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9, Income Taxes.\"\nNet Loss\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses since our inception; however,we have seen our net losses decrease steadily as our business has grown. Our net losses were $27.8 million, $48.9 million and $55.2 million for the each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The primary driver of the decreases in net losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 compared to the prior years was the significant increase in premiums earned as a result of the addition of new customers and higher allocations of business to us from existing customers, slightly offset by the continued hiring of management and staff personnel and external and professional costs.\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated balance sheets\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>559,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>336,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>57,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred policy acquisition costs, net\n</td> <td>17,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software and equipment, net\n</td> <td>15,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets\n</td> <td>13,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>662,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>463,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unearned premiums\n</td> <td>90,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for insurance claims and claims expenses\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable and accrued expenses\n</td> <td>22,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrant liability\n</td> <td>1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax liability\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities\n</td> <td>259,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>402,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>426,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities and shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>662,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>463,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $617 million in cash and investments of which $100.2 million was held at NMIH. During 2015, NMIH received $148.5 million in proceeds, net of debt discount, from drawing down on the $150 million Term Loan. We contributed a substantial portion of the proceeds to our insurance subsidiaries, which they used to purchase securities to support growth in RIF and meet the final PMIERs requirements, effective December 31, 2015. We were cash flow positive from operating activities in 2015, however our cash decreased from year-end 2014 as a result of investment purchases.\nOur deferred policy acquisition asset was $17.5 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $3.0 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was driven by the increase in deferrable costs associated with our increase in premiums written year over year from $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOur software and equipment balance increased from $11.8 million at December 31, 2014 to $15.2 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the $6.1 million spent on the continued development of our technology platform to support the growth of our business.\nOur other assets balance increased from $9.0 million at December 31, 2014 to $13.2 million as of December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in our premiums receivable balance related to our monthly policies.\nIn November 2015, we entered into the Credit Agreement and obtained the Term Loan. Our long-term debt balance under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2015 was $143.9 million.\nOur unearned premiums balance increased from $22.1 million as of December 31, 2014 to $90.8 million as of December 31, 2015 due to single premiums written in 2015, offset by cancellations of LPMI policies previously discussed and earnings of existing unearned premiums in accordance with the expiration of risk in the related policies.\nAs a result of NODs received in 2015, our reserves for insurance claims and claims expenses increased to $679 thousand at December 31, 2015 compared to $83 thousand at December 31, 2014. See, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reserves for Insurance Claims and Claims Expenses.\"\nOur accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $22.7 million as of December 31, 2015 from $10.6 million at December 31, 2014. The increase at December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of our increased headcount, accrued premium taxes, an increase in IT projects and expenses, as well as accrued interest expense related to the Term Loan. We also had an investment payable of $3.2 million as of December 31, 2015.\nOur warrant liability decreased to $1.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.4 million at December 31, 2014, as a result of a decline in our stock price during 2015.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated cash flows\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,967\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,311\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(230,165\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(419,949\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>142,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(429,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities generated positive cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the collection of premiums offset by the continued hiring of management and staff personnel and costs for contract and professional services.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $230.2 million, compared to cash provided in the same period in 2014 of $68.1 million This was a result of security acquisitions during 2015, primarily from the proceeds of the Loan.\nCash flow provided from financing activities totaled $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the proceeds, net of debt discount, of $148.5 million from the Term Loan. The cash inflows from the Term Loan were partially offset by payments of debt issuance costs and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards.\nHolding Company Liquidity and Capital Resources\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, NMIH entered into the Credit Agreement to obtain the Term Loan in the amount of $150 million in order to support the continued growth of its IIF. The Credit Agreement contains various restrictive covenants and required financial ratios and tests that we are required to meet or maintain. The Term Loan bears interest at the Eurodollar based rate (1%) plus an annual margin rate of 7.5%, payable quarterly. The Company recorded $1.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Term Loan matures on November 10, 2018.\nNMIH serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. NMIH's principal liquidity demands include funds for: (i) payment of certain corporate expenses and reimbursable expenses of its insurance subsidiaries; (ii) capital support for its insurance subsidiaries; (iii) potential payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); (iv) the payment of dividends, if any, on its common stock; and (iv) the payment of principal and interest related to the Term Loan. NMIH is not subject to any limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations, such as NMIH, that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware corporation law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation's capital surplus or (subject to certain limitations) recent net profits. As of December 31, 2015, NMIH's shareholders' equity was approximately $403 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, NMIH had $100.2 million of cash and investments. NMIH's principal source of operating cash is investment income, and could include future dividends from NMIC, if available and permitted under law or our agreements with the GSEs and state regulators.\nNMIH's future capital requirements depend on many factors, including NMIC's ability to successfully write new business, establish premium rates at levels sufficient to cover claims and operating costs and meet minimum required asset thresholds under the PMIERs. See \"Conditions and Trends Impacting our Business - GSE Oversight,\" above. We expect NMIH may make additional capital contributions to its insurance subsidiaries to support their applicable capital adequacy requirements from time-to-time. To the extent that the funds generated by our ongoing operations and capitalization are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financing activities, reduce our RIF, including through reinsurance arrangements, or curtail our growth and reduce our expenses. We may choose to generate additional liquidity through the issuance of debt, equity, or a combination of both. Any such future capital raise would be conducted by means of a separate prospectus or other appropriate offering document and not by means of this report.\nNMIH has entered into expense-sharing agreements with its insurance subsidiaries which have been approved by the Wisconsin OCI, but such approval may be changed or revoked at any time. NMIC's ability to pay dividends to NMIH is subject to insurance regulations requiring insurance department approval. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \"extraordinary\" and require insurance regulatory approval. Since inception, NMIC has not paid any dividends to NMIH. As NMIC had a statutory net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014, NMIC cannot pay any dividends to NMIH through December 31,\n2015 without the prior approval of the Wisconsin OCI. Certain other states in which NMIC is licensed also have statutes or regulations that restrict its ability to pay dividends.\nOur MI companies' principal operating sources of liquidity are premiums that we receive from policies and income generated by our investment portfolio. Our MI companies' primary liquidity needs include the payment of claims on our MI policies, operating expenses, investment expenses and other costs of our business. We anticipate that as our IIF grows, the premium revenue we receive will increase. We expect to manage our fixed operating expenses so that they grow at a slower rate than sales over the coming years.\nConsolidated Investment Portfolio\nOur net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7.2 million compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio conforms with our investment guidelines. The principal factors affecting our investment income include the size and credit rating of our portfolio and its net yield. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair market value, such as those resulting from changes in interest rates), the size of our investment portfolio is mainly a function of capital raised, cash generated from (or used in) operations, such as net premiums received, and investment earnings.\nConsistent with Wisconsin law, our investment policies emphasize preservation of capital, as well as total return. Based on our guidelines, our current investment portfolio is comprised almost entirely of cash and cash equivalents and fixed-income securities, all of which are investment grade. Prior to the third quarter of 2014, our investment portfolio consisted of A rated securities or better. During the third quarter of 2014, we changed our investment guidelines to allow 10-15% of the investment portfolio to be invested in BBB securities. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 13% of the investment portfolio was invested in BBB securities. Our policy guidelines contain limits on the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. We expect to preserve the liquidity of our portfolio through diversification and investment in publicly traded securities. We plan to maintain a level of liquidity commensurate with our perceived business outlook and the expected timing, direction and degree of changes in interest rates.\nThe pre-tax book yield on our portfolio, excluding unrealized gains and losses, was 1.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The book yield is calculated on our year-to-date net investment income over our average portfolio book value at December 31, 2015. We believe that the yield on our investment portfolio likely will change over time based on potential changes to the interest rate environment, the duration or mix of our investment portfolio or other factors.\nThe sectors of our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents appear in the table below: Table 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of portfolio's fair value\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>Corporate debt securities\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>U.S. treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government agencies\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.\n</td> <td>Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.\n</td> <td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.\n</td> <td>Municipal debt securities\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ratings of our investment portfolio were:\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment portfolio ratings\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAA\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment grade\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Below investment grade\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ratings above are provided by one or more of: Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. If three ratings are available, we assign the middle rating for classification purposes, otherwise we assign the lowest rating.\nInvestment Securities - Other-than-Temporary Impairment\nNet realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2015 were offset by an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) loss of $88.6 thousand due to a planned sales transaction that we expect will result in a loss in February 2016.\nTaxes\nWe are a U.S. taxpayer and are subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of approximately 35%. Our holding company files a consolidated U.S. federal and various state income tax returns on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries. Our effective income tax rate on our pre-tax loss was 0.0% , 4.7% and 0.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For further information regarding income taxes and their impact on our results of operations and financial position, see, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9, Income Taxes.\"\nThere is a tax sharing agreement between NMIH and its subsidiaries, dated August 23, 2012. Under this agreement, each of the parties mutually agreed to file a consolidated federal income tax return for 2012 and subsequent tax years, with NMIH as the direct tax filer. The tax liability of each subsidiary that is party to the agreement is limited to the amount of liability it would incur if it filed a separate tax return. Any settlements under the agreement between NMIH and a subsidiary will be made within 30 days of the filing of the applicable federal corporate income tax return with the IRS, including subsequent amended filings and IRS adjustments, except when a refund is due to a subsidiary, in which case payment shall be made to such subsidiary within 30 days after NMIH's receipt of the applicable tax refund.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $139.4 million, which expires from 2029 to 2035, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $47.0 million, which primarily expires from 2031 to 2035. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) imposes annual limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize its net operating losses (NOLs) if it experiences an ownership change.\u201d As a result of the acquisition of our insurance subsidiaries, $7.3 million of NOLs are subject to annual limitations of $0.8 million through 2016, then $0.3 million through 2029. If the Company were to experience another ownership change,\u201d further limitations would apply.\nA tax effected valuation allowance of $66.4 million and $53.7 million was recorded at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, to reflect the amount of the deferred taxes that may not be realized. As the Company has limited history, management has not yet concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income. If we conclude the taxable income will be sufficient to release the valuation allowance, we would recognize an income tax benefit associated primarily with the carry forward of federal net operating losses and future share-based compensation tax deductions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2015. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 are summarized in the table that follows.\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations*\n</td> <td>14,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>1,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>2,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities reflected on the registrant's balance sheet under GAAP\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Long-term debt relates to our $150 million Credit Agreement and includes future interest payments using the minimum interest rate of 8.50%.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe use accounting principles and methods that conform to GAAP. Where GAAP specifically excludes mortgage insurance we follow general industry practices. We are required to apply significant judgment and make material estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and with regard to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Assumptions and estimates are required to apply these principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical. These critical accounting policies and estimates are summarized below.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn the MI industry, a \"book\" is a group of loans that an MI company insures in a particular period, normally a calendar year. We set premiums at the time a policy is issued based on our expectations regarding likely performance over the term of coverage. The policies we write are guaranteed renewable contracts at the policyholder's option on a single, annual or monthly premium basis. We generally have no ability to re-underwrite or reprice these contracts. Premiums written on a single premium basis and an annual premium basis are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and earned over the policy term commencing in the month coverage begins. Premiums written on policies covering more than one year are amortized over the policy life in accordance with the expiration of risk which is the anticipated claim payment pattern based on industry experience. Premiums written on annual policies are earned on a monthly pro rata basis. Premiums written on monthly policies are earned as coverage is provided. Premiums written on pool transactions are earned over the period that coverage is provided. Upon cancellation of a policy, all premium that is non-refundable is immediately earned. Any refundable premium is returned to the policyholder. Premiums returned to policyholders are recorded as a reduction of written and earned premiums in the current period, which affects premiums written and earned in those periods.\nReserve for Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nWe wrote our first MI policy in April 2013. We do not anticipate a material level of claims (relative to written premiums or stockholder equity) in the first few years of our operations. Our practice is to establish claim reserves only for loans in default. We do not consider a loan to be in default for claim reserve purposes until we receive notice from the servicer that a borrower has failed to make two consecutive regularly scheduled payments and is at least sixty days in default. Default is defined in our Master Policy as the failure by a borrower to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled mortgage payment due under the terms of a loan or the failure by a borrower to pay all amounts due under a loan after the exercise of the due on sale clause of such loan. In addition to reserves on reported defaults, we establish IBNR reserves for estimated claims incurred on loans that have been in default for at least sixty days that have not yet been reported to us by the servicers.\nConsistent with industry accounting practices, for purposes of establishing claim reserves, we adhere to the general claim reserving principles contained in ASC Topic 944, Financial Services - Insurance (ASC 944), even though that standard expressly excludes mortgage insurance from its guidance. Like other mortgage insurers, we will not establish claim reserves for anticipated future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default.\nThe establishment of claim and IBNR reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. We establish claim reserves using our best estimates of claim rates, i.e., the percent of loan defaults that ultimately result in claim payments, and claim amounts, i.e., the dollar amounts required to settle claims, to estimate the ultimate claims on loans reported to us as being at least sixty days in default as of the end of each reporting period. We estimate IBNR by analyzing historical lags in default reporting to determine a specific number of IBNR claims in each reporting period. We utilize internal and external data to estimate lags in NOD reporting. Additionally, our estimates of claim rates and claim sizes are strongly influenced by prevailing economic conditions, for example current rates or trends in unemployment, house price appreciation and/or interest rates, and our best judgment as to the future values or trends of these macroeconomic factors.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe following describes the valuation techniques used by us to determine the fair value of financial instruments held as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nWe established a fair value hierarchy by prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under this standard are described below:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 - Prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nand liabilities; and\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The level of market activity used to determine the fair value hierarchy is based on the availability of observable inputs market participants would use to price an asset or a liability, including market value price observations.\nAssets classified as Level 1 and Level 2\nTo determine the fair value of securities available-for-sale in Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, independent pricing sources have been utilized. One price is provided per security based on observable market data. To ensure securities are appropriately classified in the fair value hierarchy, we review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing sources and believe that their policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the issue valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded. A variety of inputs are utilized by the independent pricing sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including data published in market research publications. Inputs may be weighted differently for any security, and not all inputs are used for each security evaluation. Market indicators, industry and economic events are also considered. This information is evaluated using a multidimensional pricing model. Quality controls are performed by the independent pricing sources throughout this process, which include reviewing tolerance reports, trading information and data changes, and directional moves compared to market moves. This model combines all inputs to arrive at a value assigned to each security. We have not made any adjustments to the prices obtained from the independent pricing sources; however, we do perform quality checks and review the prices received.\nLiabilities classified as Level 3\nOur outstanding warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, in combination with a binomial model. We use a Monte-Carlo simulation model to value the pricing protection features within the warrants. Variables in the model include the risk-free rate of return, dividend yield, expected life and expected volatility of the Company's stock price.\nASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires all entities to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.\nInvestment Portfolio\nWe classify our entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale and report it at fair value. The related unrealized gains or losses, after considering the related tax expense or benefit, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. We expect to hold short-term investments with maturities of greater than three and less than 12 months when purchased, and such investments will be carried at fair value. Any realized gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on a specific-identification basis. We expect that our investment income will consist primarily of interest. We recognize interest income on an accrual basis. Net investment income would represent interest income, net of investment expenses.\nThe guidance regarding the recognition and presentation of other-than temporary impairment (OTTI) requires that an OTTI of a debt security be separated into two components when there are credit-related losses associated with the impaired debt security for which we assert that we do not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before recovery of our cost basis. Under this guidance, the amount of the OTTI related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount of the OTTI related to other factors (such as changes in interest rates or market conditions) is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). In instances where no credit loss exists but it is more likely than not that we would have to sell the debt security prior to the anticipated recovery, the decline in fair value below amortized cost is recognized as an OTTI in earnings. In periods after recognition of an OTTI on debt securities, we account for such securities as if they had been purchased on the measurement date of the OTTI at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings. For debt securities for which OTTI are recognized in earnings, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected would be accreted or amortized into net investment income.\nEach fiscal quarter we perform reviews of our investments in order to determine whether declines in fair value below amortized cost are considered other-than-temporary in accordance with applicable guidance. Under the current guidance, a debt security impairment is deemed other-than-temporary if either it is intended that the security be sold, or it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery or we do not expect to collect cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized\ncost basis of the security. In evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, we may consider several factors including, but not limited to:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>extent and duration of the decline;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>change in rating below investment grade; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or a geographic area.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Premium Deficiency Reserve\nWe perform a premium deficiency calculation each fiscal quarter using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date. Per ASC 944, a premium deficiency reserve shall be recognized if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses, expected dividends to policyholders, unamortized acquisition costs, and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums. The calculation of premium deficiency reserves requires the use of significant judgment and estimates to determine the present value of future premiums and present value of expected claims and expenses on our business. The present value of future premiums relies on, among other things, assumptions about persistency and repayment patterns on underlying loans. The present value of expected claims and expenses depends on assumptions relating to severity of claims, claim rates on current defaults and expected defaults in future periods. These assumptions may also include an estimate of expected rescission activity. Assumptions used in calculating premium deficiency reserves can be affected by volatility in the current housing and mortgage lending industries. To the extent premium patterns and actual claim experience differ from the assumptions used in calculating a premium deficiency reserve, the differences between the actual results and our estimate will affect future period earnings. In considering the potential sensitivity of the factors underlying our best estimate of premium deficiency reserves, it is possible that even a relatively small change in estimated claim rate or a relatively small percentage change in estimated claim amount could have a significant impact on establishing a premium deficiency reserve, should one be needed, and, correspondingly, on our operating results.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nCosts directly associated with the successful acquisition of mortgage insurance policies, consisting of employee compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses, are initially deferred and reported as deferred insurance policy acquisition costs. Deferred insurance policy acquisition costs arising from each book of business are charged against revenue in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums.\nIf a premium deficiency exists, as described above, we reduce the related deferred insurance policy acquisition costs by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than the deferred insurance policy acquisition costs balance, we then establish a premium deficiency reserve equal to the excess, by means of a charge to current period earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. The liability method measures the expected future tax effects of temporary differences at the enacted tax rates applicable for the period in which the deferred asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements that would result in future increases or decreases in taxes owed on a cash basis compared to amounts already recognized as tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. We evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In the course of our review, we assess all available evidence, both positive and negative, including future sources of income, tax planning strategies, future contractual cash flows and reversing temporary differences. Additional valuation allowance benefits or charges could be recognized in the future due to changes in management's expectations regarding the realization of tax benefits.\nWarrants\nWe account for warrants to purchase our common shares in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC 815-40 Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. Our outstanding warrants may be settled by us using either (i) a physical settlement method or (ii) cashless exercise, where shares that are issued upon exercise of the warrants are reduced to cover the cost of the exercise, in lieu of the holder remitting a cash payment of the exercise price. The warrants expire after the 10th anniversary of the dates they were issued, after which they are not exercisable. The exercise price and the number of warrants are subject to anti-dilution provisions whereby the existing exercise price is adjusted downward, and the number of warrants increased, for events that may not be dilutive. The adjustment may be in excess of any dilution suffered. As a result, the warrants are classified as a liability. We revalue the warrants at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is reported in the statements of operations in the period in which the change occurred. The fair value of the warrants is calculated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model in combination with a binomial model. We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the pricing protection features within the warrants. Variables in the model include the fair value of the stock, risk-free rate of return, dividend yield, expected life and expected volatility of the Company's stock price.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe adopted ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 addresses accounting for share-based awards and recognizes compensation expense, measured using grant date fair value, over the requisite service or performance period of the award. Share-based payments include stock options and restricted stock unit (RSU) grants under the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan and the NMIH 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The fair value of stock option grants issued are determined based on an option pricing model which takes into account various assumptions that are subjective. Key assumptions used in the stock option valuation include the fair value of the stock on the grant date, the expected term of the equity award taking into account the contractual term of the award, the effects of expected exercise and post-vesting termination behavior, expected volatility, expected dividends and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award. RSU grants to certain employees contain a market and service condition. The fair value of RSU grants to employees prior to our IPO was determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation model at the date of grant. Following the IPO, fair value was determined based on closing price on the grant date. Restricted grants to non-employee directors are valued at our stock price on the date of grant less the present value of anticipated dividends. Expense is recognized over the required service period, which is generally a three-year vesting period for the options (vesting in one-third increments per year).\nThe estimated grant date fair values of the stock options granted during 2015 and 2014 were calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model based on the following assumptions:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected life\n</td> <td>6.0 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk free interest rate\n</td> <td>1.65% - 1.78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.90% - 2.01%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend yield\n</td> <td>0.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected stock price volatility\n</td> <td>34.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected forfeiture rate\n</td> <td>7.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpected Life - is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules, historical exercise and forfeiture patterns. We use the simplified method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 to estimate expected lives for options granted during the period as historical exercise data is not available and the options meet the requirements set out in the Bulletin. Options granted have a maximum term of ten years.\nRisk Free Interest Rate - is the U.S. Treasury rate for the date of the grant having a term approximating the expected life of the option.\nDividend Yield - is calculated by dividing the expected annual dividend by our stock price at the valuation date.\nExpected Stock Price Volatility - is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. At the time of grants, our common shares trading history was not sufficient to calculate an expected volatility representative of the volatility over the expected lives of the options. As a substitute for such estimate, we used historical volatilities of a set of comparable companies in the industry in which we operate.\nProjected Forfeiture Rate - is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.\nRestricted Stock Units\nFor RSUs which are subject to a service condition, expense is recognized over the required service period, which is generally a three-year vesting period (vesting in one-third increments per year). Expense is measured by multiplying the number of RSUs by the grant date fair value.\nThe estimated grant date fair values of the RSUs granted in 2012 that are subject to both a market and service condition were calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model based on the average outcome of 150,000 simulations using the following assumptions:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected life\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk free interest rate\n</td> <td>0.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend yield\n</td> <td>0.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected stock price volatility\n</td> <td>39.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected forfeiture rate\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn February 2013, the Board approved a modification to the vesting terms of approximately 400,000 granted and non-vested RSUs held by our employees. The modification to the vesting terms removed the market condition leaving the RSUs subject to a service condition only. The modification resulted in a change in the period over which compensation costs are recognized and prospective recognition of incremental compensation cost. Incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified using relevant valuation inputs as of the modification date.", "item_7_truncated": "Costs directly associated with the successful acquisition of mortgage insurance policies, consisting of employee compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses, are initially deferred and reported as deferred insurance policy acquisition costs. Deferred insurance policy acquisition costs arising from each book of business are charged against revenue in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums.\nOur outstanding warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, in combination with a binomial model. We use a Monte-Carlo simulation model to value the pricing protection features within the warrants. Variables in the model include the risk-free rate of return, dividend yield, expected life and expected volatility of the Company's stock price.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Top 10 primary IIF and RIF by state\n</td> <td>IIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RIF\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>California\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>Texas\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.\n</td> <td>Virginia\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.\n</td> <td>Florida\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.\n</td> <td>Michigan\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.\n</td> <td>Colorado\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.\n</td> <td>Arizona\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8.\n</td> <td>Pennsylvania\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9.\n</td> <td>North Carolina\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10.\n</td> <td>New Jersey\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProjected Forfeiture Rate - is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested.

Upon cancellation of a policy, all premium that is non-refundable is immediately earned, and any refundable premium is returned to the policyholder. Cancellations due to refinancings are affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on our IIF. Refinancings are also affected by current home values compared to values when the loans became insured and the terms on which mortgage credit is available. To a lesser extent, cancellations also result from claim payments, as we return any premium received from the servicer after the date the insured mortgage defaults.

Moreover, NMIC has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of its failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements. We will continue to monitor our compliance with the PMIERs going forward.\nWe wrote our first MI policy in April 2013. We do not anticipate a material level of claims (relative to written premiums or stockholder equity) in the first few years of our operations. Our practice is to establish claim reserves only for loans in default. We do not consider a loan to be in default for claim reserve purposes until we receive notice from the servicer that a borrower has failed to make two consecutive regularly scheduled payments and is at least sixty days in default. Default is defined in our Master Policy as the failure by a borrower to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled mortgage payment due under the terms of a loan or the failure by a borrower to pay all amounts due under a loan after the exercise of the due on sale clause of such loan. In addition to reserves on reported defaults, we establish IBNR reserves for estimated claims incurred on loans that have been in default for at least sixty days that have not yet been reported to us by the servicers.\n \u2022 failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; \nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary and pool premiums written and earned\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>45,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Loss\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nNMIH serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. NMIH's principal liquidity demands include funds for: (i) payment of certain corporate expenses and reimbursable expenses of its insurance subsidiaries; (ii) capital support for its insurance subsidiaries; (iii) potential payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); (iv) the payment of dividends, if any, on its common stock; and (iv) the payment of principal and interest related to the Term Loan. NMIH is not subject to any limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations, such as NMIH, that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware corporation law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation's capital surplus or (subject to certain limitations) recent net profits. As of December 31, 2015, NMIH's shareholders' equity was approximately $403 million.\n \u2022 the product mix of our book of business, which includes recurring monthly premiums earned for monthly policies and the recognition of premiums earned from the amortization of our single premiums over the policies' lives. We expect our product mix and the average premium rate we charge to be comparable with the industry in general as our business matures; \nThe guidance regarding the recognition and presentation of other-than temporary impairment (OTTI) requires that an OTTI of a debt security be separated into two components when there are credit-related losses associated with the impaired debt security for which we assert that we do not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before recovery of our cost basis. Under this guidance, the amount of the OTTI related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount of the OTTI related to other factors (such as changes in interest rates or market conditions) is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). In instances where no credit loss exists but it is more likely than not that we would have to sell the debt security prior to the anticipated recovery, the decline in fair value below amortized cost is recognized as an OTTI in earnings. In periods after recognition of an OTTI on debt securities, we account for such securities as if they had been purchased on the measurement date of the OTTI at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings. For debt securities for which OTTI are recognized in earnings, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected would be accreted or amortized into net investment income.\nCapital Position of Our Insurance Subsidiaries\nNMIC's primary insurance may be written on a flow basis, in which loans are insured in individual, loan-by-loan transactions, or on an aggregated basis, in which each loan in a portfolio of loans is individually insured in a single transaction.\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included below in Item 8 of this report and the Risk Factors included above in Part I, Item 1A of this report. In addition, investors should review the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" above.\n\nOperating activities generated positive cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the collection of premiums offset by the continued hiring of management and staff personnel and costs for contract and professional services.\nGeographic Dispersion\nPrimary NIW in 2015 increased 260% from the prior year as a result of an increase in customers with approved master policies as well as an increase in our primary flow business for the year ended December 31, 2015. Single NIW in 2015 increased 216% over the prior year due to greater lender demand for our single premium LPMI products. Single premiums written on an aggregated basis were 20% of total NIW in 2015, down from 46% in the prior year. Monthly NIW in 2015 increased 323% over the prior year as a result of new account activation and continued penetration of existing customer accounts.\nWe adopted ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 addresses accounting for share-based awards and recognizes compensation expense, measured using grant date fair value, over the requisite service or performance period of the award. Share-based payments include stock options and restricted stock unit (RSU) grants under the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan and the NMIH 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The fair value of stock option grants issued are determined based on an option pricing model which takes into account various assumptions that are subjective. Key assumptions used in the stock option valuation include the fair value of the stock on the grant date, the expected term of the equity award taking into account the contractual term of the award, the effects of expected exercise and post-vesting termination behavior, expected volatility, expected dividends and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award. RSU grants to certain employees contain a market and service condition. The fair value of RSU grants to employees prior to our IPO was determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation model at the date of grant. Following the IPO, fair value was determined based on closing price on the grant date. Restricted grants to non-employee directors are valued at our stock price on the date of grant less the present value of anticipated dividends. Expense is recognized over the required service period, which is generally a three-year vesting period for the options (vesting in one-third increments per year).\n\nState insurance regulators also have the authority to make changes to capital requirements. The NAIC has formed a working group to develop and recommend more robust regulations governing mortgage insurance, including, among other things, strengthened capital requirements, underwriting standards, claims practices and market conduct. We, along with other MI companies, are working with the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Working Group of the Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC (Working Group). The Working Group will determine and make a recommendation to the Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC as to what changes the Working Group believes are necessary to the solvency and market practices regulation of MI companies, including changes to the Mortgage Guaranty Insurers Model Act (Model #630). We have provided feedback to the Working Group since early 2013. The Working Group's discussions are ongoing and the ultimate outcome of these discussions and any potential actions taken by the NAIC cannot be predicted at this time. If the Working Group proposes that the NAIC adopt more stringent capital requirements, this could ultimately lead to NMIC being obligated to hold more capital for its insured business than we are required to holder under PMIERs, which would reduce our profitability compared to the profitability we expect under the existing capital requirements.\nThe table below reflects the percentage of our primary RIF by loan type.\nThe table below reflects a summary of our primary IIF and RIF by book year.\n\nOur warrant liability decreased to $1.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.4 million at December 31, 2014, as a result of a decline in our stock price during 2015.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe monitor the concentrations of various risk attributes in our insurance portfolio. Generally, insuring loans made to borrowers with higher credit scores tends to result in a lower frequency of claims than with loans made to borrowers with lower credit scores. As of December 31, 2015, our primary IIF and RIF were made up of approximately 64.3% and 64.1%, respectively, of loans to borrowers who had credit scores at or above 740. Our primary weighted average FICO for NIW in the year ended December 31, 2015 was 752. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, all loans in our insurance portfolio were full documentation loans, and approximately 4% of our RIF was on loans above 95% LTV. Our primary weighted average LTV for NIW in the year ended December 31, 2015 was 91%.\n \u2022 Level 2 - Prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets \n\nIn the MI industry, a \"book\" is a group of loans that an MI company insures in a particular period, normally a calendar year. We set premiums at the time a policy is issued based on our expectations regarding likely performance over the term of coverage. The policies we write are guaranteed renewable contracts at the policyholder's option on a single, annual or monthly premium basis. We generally have no ability to re-underwrite or reprice these contracts. Premiums written on a single premium basis and an annual premium basis are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and earned over the policy term commencing in the month coverage begins. Premiums written on policies covering more than one year are amortized over the policy life in accordance with the expiration of risk which is the anticipated claim payment pattern based on industry experience. Premiums written on annual policies are earned on a monthly pro rata basis. Premiums written on monthly policies are earned as coverage is provided. Premiums written on pool transactions are earned over the period that coverage is provided. Upon cancellation of a policy, all premium that is non-refundable is immediately earned. Any refundable premium is returned to the policyholder. Premiums returned to policyholders are recorded as a reduction of written and earned premiums in the current period, which affects premiums written and earned in those periods.\n \u2022 Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $139.4 million, which expires from 2029 to 2035, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $47.0 million, which primarily expires from 2031 to 2035. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) imposes annual limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize its net operating losses (NOLs) if it experiences an ownership change.\u201d As a result of the acquisition of our insurance subsidiaries, $7.3 million of NOLs are subject to annual limitations of $0.8 million through 2016, then $0.3 million through 2029. If the Company were to experience another ownership change,\u201d further limitations would apply.\n\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. The liability method measures the expected future tax effects of temporary differences at the enacted tax rates applicable for the period in which the deferred asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements that would result in future increases or decreases in taxes owed on a cash basis compared to amounts already recognized as tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. We evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In the course of our review, we assess all available evidence, both positive and negative, including future sources of income, tax planning strategies, future contractual cash flows and reversing temporary differences. Additional valuation allowance benefits or charges could be recognized in the future due to changes in management's expectations regarding the realization of tax benefits.\n \u2022 the typical distribution of claims over the life of a book results in fewer defaults during the first two years after loans are originated, usually peaking in years three through six and declining thereafter; \nOur other assets balance increased from $9.0 million at December 31, 2014 to $13.2 million as of December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in our premiums receivable balance related to our monthly policies.\nIn recent years, the level of competition within the private MI industry has been intense and is not expected to diminish. Lenders have requested discounts from mortgage insurers with greater frequency, particularly with respect to LPMI single premium policies. A significant percentage of our total business to date has consisted of single premium policies, some of which has been written at a discounted rate, which may impact our premium yields in the near term. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented new LPMI and BPMI rates, which we expect will improve premium yields on our future NIW and have the effect of increasing the amount of monthly NIW as a percentage of our total mix over time.\n\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2015. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 are summarized in the table that follows.\nThe following table reflects the percentage and policy count of our RIF by LTV. We calculate the LTV of a loan as a percentage of the original loan amount to the original value of the property securing the loan. In general, the lower the LTV the lower the likelihood of a default, and for loans that default, a lower LTV generally results in lower severity for a resulting claim, as the borrower has more equity in the property.\n \u2022 the distribution of claims over the life of a book. Historically, the first two to three years after loans are originated are a period of relatively low claims, with claims increasing substantially for several years subsequent and then declining. Factors, such as persistency of the book, the condition of the economy, including unemployment and housing prices, and others, can affect this pattern.  We expect that claims incurred for the early years of our operations will be relatively low for the following reasons:\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1, \"Business - Customers,\" our sales and marketing strategy is focused on increasing market share from existing customers and attracting new mortgage originator customers in the U.S. that fall into two primary categories, which we refer to as \"National Accounts\" and \"Regional Accounts.\"\n\nTaxes\nOverview\nOur persistency rate is the percentage of policies in force that remains on our books after any twelve-month period. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, changes in persistency rates can have a significant impact on our earnings. The persistency rate on our portfolio was 84.1% at December 31, 2015. In recent quarters, we have experienced high volumes of single premium policy cancellations driven by refinance activity, which has contributed to lower persistency than generally expected. We believe single premium policy cancellations will decrease if interest rates rise.\nWe classify our entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale and report it at fair value. The related unrealized gains or losses, after considering the related tax expense or benefit, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. We expect to hold short-term investments with maturities of greater than three and less than 12 months when purchased, and such investments will be carried at fair value. Any realized gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on a specific-identification basis. We expect that our investment income will consist primarily of interest. We recognize interest income on an accrual basis. Net investment income would represent interest income, net of investment expenses.\nAlthough there has been broad policy consensus toward the need for private capital to play a larger role and government credit risk to be reduced in the U.S. housing finance system, recent action by the current administration has made it difficult to predict whether the market share of governmental agencies such as the FHA and VA will recede to historical levels. On January 26, 2015, the FHA reduced some of its single-family annual mortgage insurance premiums. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact from this premium reduction on our business. It is difficult to predict what, if any, material impact this premium reduction will have in the future as there are factors beyond premium rate that influence a lender's decision to choose private MI over FHA insurance, including among others, the FHA's loan eligibility requirements and loan size limits and the relative ease of use of private MI products compared to FHA products. However, we believe our pricing continues to be more attractive than the FHA's pricing for a substantial majority of borrowers with credit and loan characteristics similar to those whose loans we insure.\nReserve for Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\n\n \u2022 low NIW in our early years of operations.  We developed our estimates of the expected frequency and severity of claims based on statutory filings by many of our competitors, which contain historical book year performance, as well as an industry dataset which consists of nearly 150 million mortgages and 80 data fields per mortgage, gathered over the past 17 years. As state-regulated entities, mortgage insurers are required to file actuarial justifications for premium rate changes in many states, many of which are publicly available and include historical information on claim frequency and severity. Historical performance data from similar underwriting, house price, and interest rate periods were compared to today to determine a range of expected performance. To date, our loss experience is developing at a slower pace than historical trends have shown, primarily as a result of the relatively strong economy, which has led to a more favorable housing market and lower interest rates.\nThe estimated grant date fair values of the RSUs granted in 2012 that are subject to both a market and service condition were calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model based on the average outcome of 150,000 simulations using the following assumptions:\nAs a participant in the mortgage lending and MI industries, we rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide and expand our products and services. We have established and implemented security measures, controls and procedures to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed and/or stored in such systems. We periodically employ third parties to evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, controls and procedures. In addition, we have established a business continuity plan that is designed to allow our business to continue to operate in the midst of certain disruptive events, including any disruptions to our information technology systems. We also have an incident response plan that is designed to address information security incidents, including breaches of our information technology systems. Despite these safeguards, disruptions to and breaches of our information technology systems are possible and may negatively impact our business.\nand liabilities; and\nOur unearned premiums balance increased from $22.1 million as of December 31, 2014 to $90.8 million as of December 31, 2015 due to single premiums written in 2015, offset by cancellations of LPMI policies previously discussed and earnings of existing unearned premiums in accordance with the expiration of risk in the related policies.\n\nASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires all entities to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.\nWarrants\nIn July 2015, Standard & Poor's (S&P) Ratings Services assigned its \"BBB-\" financial strength and long-term counter-party credit ratings to NMIC. At the same time, S&P assigned its \"BB-\" long-term counter-party credit rating to NMIH. S&P's outlook for both companies is \"stable.\"\n\n\nExpected Stock Price Volatility - is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. At the time of grants, our common shares trading history was not sufficient to calculate an expected volatility representative of the volatility over the expected lives of the options. As a substitute for such estimate, we used historical volatilities of a set of comparable companies in the industry in which we operate.\nCybersecurity\nGiven our growth during 2015, we believe that a quarter-over-quarter comparison of net premiums written is more meaningful than comparing net premiums written year-over-year. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we had net premiums written of $45.6 million and net premiums earned of $16.9 million, compared to net premiums written of $35.4 million and net premiums earned of $12.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we had net monthly premiums written and earned of $9.6 million compared to $7.3 million for the third quarter of 2015.\nWe set premiums at the time a policy is issued based on our expectations regarding likely performance over the term of coverage. We offer BPMI and LPMI options. Premium rates are based on the risk characteristics of each insured loan and the capital required to support particular products. Capital charges are governed by the updated PMIERs and for LPMI policies, will increase in 2016. See \"- GSE Oversight,\" below.\nNMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH), a Delaware corporation incorporated in May 2011 provides private mortgage guaranty insurance (which we refer to as \"mortgage insurance\" or \"MI\") through its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries. Our primary insurance subsidiary, National Mortgage Insurance Corporation (NMIC), is a qualified MI provider on loans purchased by the GSEs and is licensed in all 50 states and D.C. to issue MI. Our reinsurance subsidiary, National Mortgage Reinsurance Inc One (Re One), solely provides reinsurance to NMIC on certain loans insured by NMIC, as described in Note 14, Statutory Information - Reinsurance, below. NMIH's wholly owned subsidiary, NMI Services, Inc. (NMIS), began offering outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol \"NMIH.\"\n\nOur MI companies' principal operating sources of liquidity are premiums that we receive from policies and income generated by our investment portfolio. Our MI companies' primary liquidity needs include the payment of claims on our MI policies, operating expenses, investment expenses and other costs of our business. We anticipate that as our IIF grows, the premium revenue we receive will increase. We expect to manage our fixed operating expenses so that they grow at a slower rate than sales over the coming years.\n \u2022 the percentage of coverage on insured loans, with higher percentages of insurance coverage tending to result in higher incurred claim amounts than lower percentages of insurance coverage; \n (2) End of period RIF divided by IIF.  We utilize certain risk principles that form the basis of how we underwrite and originate primary NIW. We manage our portfolio credit risk by using several loan eligibility matrices which prescribe the maximum LTV, minimum borrower credit score, maximum loan size, property type and occupancy status of loans that we will insure. Our loan eligibility matrices, as well as all of our detailed underwriting guidelines, are contained in our Underwriting Guideline Manual that is publicly available on our website. Our eligibility criteria and underwriting guidelines are designed to mitigate the layered risk inherent in a single insurance policy. \"Layered risk\" refers to the accumulation of borrower, loan and property risk. For example, we have higher credit score and lower maximum allowed LTV requirements for riskier property types, such as investor properties, compared to owner-occupied properties.\n \u2022 our intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery; \nWe have incurred significant net operating losses since our inception; however,we have seen our net losses decrease steadily as our business has grown. Our net losses were $27.8 million, $48.9 million and $55.2 million for the each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The primary driver of the decreases in net losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 compared to the prior years was the significant increase in premiums earned as a result of the addition of new customers and higher allocations of business to us from existing customers, slightly offset by the continued hiring of management and staff personnel and external and professional costs.\n (1) Reported as of the end of the period. \nThe table below reflects a summary of the change in total primary IIF for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nCompetition\n2015 without the prior approval of the Wisconsin OCI. Certain other states in which NMIC is licensed also have statutes or regulations that restrict its ability to pay dividends.\nWe recorded no income tax for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $2.4 million of income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9, Income Taxes.\"\nWe offer monthly, annual and single premium payment plans. Policies written on a single premium basis are paid through a single, upfront payment, the majority of which is initially deferred as unearned premium and earned over the policy term. For monthly policies, premiums are earned and collected each month as coverage is provided.\nConsistent with Wisconsin law, our investment policies emphasize preservation of capital, as well as total return. Based on our guidelines, our current investment portfolio is comprised almost entirely of cash and cash equivalents and fixed-income securities, all of which are investment grade. Prior to the third quarter of 2014, our investment portfolio consisted of A rated securities or better. During the third quarter of 2014, we changed our investment guidelines to allow 10-15% of the investment portfolio to be invested in BBB securities. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 13% of the investment portfolio was invested in BBB securities. Our policy guidelines contain limits on the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. We expect to preserve the liquidity of our portfolio through diversification and investment in publicly traded securities. We plan to maintain a level of liquidity commensurate with our perceived business outlook and the expected timing, direction and degree of changes in interest rates.\nExpenses\nNMIH's future capital requirements depend on many factors, including NMIC's ability to successfully write new business, establish premium rates at levels sufficient to cover claims and operating costs and meet minimum required asset thresholds under the PMIERs. See \"Conditions and Trends Impacting our Business - GSE Oversight,\" above. We expect NMIH may make additional capital contributions to its insurance subsidiaries to support their applicable capital adequacy requirements from time-to-time. To the extent that the funds generated by our ongoing operations and capitalization are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financing activities, reduce our RIF, including through reinsurance arrangements, or curtail our growth and reduce our expenses. We may choose to generate additional liquidity through the issuance of debt, equity, or a combination of both. Any such future capital raise would be conducted by means of a separate prospectus or other appropriate offering document and not by means of this report.\nWe had net single premiums written and earned of $34.8 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to net single premiums written and earned of $26.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2015. Net single premiums earned increased as a result of an increase in single premiums written during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, as well as from cancellations on LPMI singles, which are non-refundable and fully earned upon cancellation. Net pool premiums written and earned of $1.2 million for both during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was down slightly quarter over quarter due to the pay off of approximately 341 loans in the pool from September 30, 2015. We have not written significant annual premiums through December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 the LTV ratio, with higher average LTV ratios tending to increase claims incurred; \nOur software and equipment balance increased from $11.8 million at December 31, 2014 to $15.2 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the $6.1 million spent on the continued development of our technology platform to support the growth of our business.\nHolding Company Liquidity and Capital Resources\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLiabilities classified as Level 3\nIncome Taxes\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, NMIH entered into the Credit Agreement to obtain the Term Loan in the amount of $150 million in order to support the continued growth of its IIF. The Credit Agreement contains various restrictive covenants and required financial ratios and tests that we are required to meet or maintain. The Term Loan bears interest at the Eurodollar based rate (1%) plus an annual margin rate of 7.5%, payable quarterly. The Company recorded $1.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Term Loan matures on November 10, 2018.\nConsolidated Investment Portfolio\n\nWe perform a premium deficiency calculation each fiscal quarter using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date. Per ASC 944, a premium deficiency reserve shall be recognized if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses, expected dividends to policyholders, unamortized acquisition costs, and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums. The calculation of premium deficiency reserves requires the use of significant judgment and estimates to determine the present value of future premiums and present value of expected claims and expenses on our business. The present value of future premiums relies on, among other things, assumptions about persistency and repayment patterns on underlying loans. The present value of expected claims and expenses depends on assumptions relating to severity of claims, claim rates on current defaults and expected defaults in future periods. These assumptions may also include an estimate of expected rescission activity. Assumptions used in calculating premium deficiency reserves can be affected by volatility in the current housing and mortgage lending industries. To the extent premium patterns and actual claim experience differ from the assumptions used in calculating a premium deficiency reserve, the differences between the actual results and our estimate will affect future period earnings. In considering the potential sensitivity of the factors underlying our best estimate of premium deficiency reserves, it is possible that even a relatively small change in estimated claim rate or a relatively small percentage change in estimated claim amount could have a significant impact on establishing a premium deficiency reserve, should one be needed, and, correspondingly, on our operating results.\nFor RSUs which are subject to a service condition, expense is recognized over the required service period, which is generally a three-year vesting period (vesting in one-third increments per year). Expense is measured by multiplying the number of RSUs by the grant date fair value.\n \u2022 premium rates, which are based on the risk characteristics of the loans insured, the percentage of coverage on the loans, competition from other mortgage insurers and general industry conditions; and \nThe lenders in the combined residential mortgage market who control the MI decision are currently comprised of three groups:\nThe table below shows primary and pool IIF, NIW and premiums written and earned. Single NIW and IIF includes policies written on an aggregated and flow basis.\nWe discuss below our results of operations for the periods presented, as well as the conditions and trends that have impacted or are expected to impact our business, including customer development, new business writings, the composition of our insurance portfolio, and other factors that we expect to impact our results.\n\nThe ratings above are provided by one or more of: Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. If three ratings are available, we assign the middle rating for classification purposes, otherwise we assign the lowest rating.\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, NMIH had $100.2 million of cash and investments. NMIH's principal source of operating cash is investment income, and could include future dividends from NMIC, if available and permitted under law or our agreements with the GSEs and state regulators.\nThe establishment of claim and IBNR reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. We establish claim reserves using our best estimates of claim rates, i.e., the percent of loan defaults that ultimately result in claim payments, and claim amounts, i.e., the dollar amounts required to settle claims, to estimate the ultimate claims on loans reported to us as being at least sixty days in default as of the end of each reporting period. We estimate IBNR by analyzing historical lags in default reporting to determine a specific number of IBNR claims in each reporting period. We utilize internal and external data to estimate lags in NOD reporting. Additionally, our estimates of claim rates and claim sizes are strongly influenced by prevailing economic conditions, for example current rates or trends in unemployment, house price appreciation and/or interest rates, and our best judgment as to the future values or trends of these macroeconomic factors.\n\nWe are a U.S. taxpayer and are subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of approximately 35%. Our holding company files a consolidated U.S. federal and various state income tax returns on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries. Our effective income tax rate on our pre-tax loss was 0.0% , 4.7% and 0.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For further information regarding income taxes and their impact on our results of operations and financial position, see, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9, Income Taxes.\"\nWe account for warrants to purchase our common shares in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC 815-40 Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. Our outstanding warrants may be settled by us using either (i) a physical settlement method or (ii) cashless exercise, where shares that are issued upon exercise of the warrants are reduced to cover the cost of the exercise, in lieu of the holder remitting a cash payment of the exercise price. The warrants expire after the 10th anniversary of the dates they were issued, after which they are not exercisable. The exercise price and the number of warrants are subject to anti-dilution provisions whereby the existing exercise price is adjusted downward, and the number of warrants increased, for events that may not be dilutive. The adjustment may be in excess of any dilution suffered. As a result, the warrants are classified as a liability. We revalue the warrants at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is reported in the statements of operations in the period in which the change occurred. The fair value of the warrants is calculated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model in combination with a binomial model. We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the pricing protection features within the warrants. Variables in the model include the fair value of the stock, risk-free rate of return, dividend yield, expected life and expected volatility of the Company's stock price.\nWe established a fair value hierarchy by prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under this standard are described below:\nWe use accounting principles and methods that conform to GAAP. Where GAAP specifically excludes mortgage insurance we follow general industry practices. We are required to apply significant judgment and make material estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and with regard to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Assumptions and estimates are required to apply these principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical. These critical accounting policies and estimates are summarized below.\n \u2022 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.  The level of market activity used to determine the fair value hierarchy is based on the availability of observable inputs market participants would use to price an asset or a liability, including market value price observations.\nThe following describes the valuation techniques used by us to determine the fair value of financial instruments held as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, NMIH raised additional capital by entering into the Credit Agreement to obtain the Term Loan in the amount of $150 million. Concurrently with the closing of the Credit Agreement, NMIH borrowed $150 million from the facility and subsequently made contributions to NMIC of $145.4 million of cash and securities during the fourth quarter to support growth in NMIC's RIF and meet the final PMIERs requirements as of the Effective Date. As a result, as of December 31, 2015, NMIC had sufficient assets to meet the PMIERs financial requirements and we expect to certify to the GSEs by March 1, 2016 that NMIC fully complies with the PMIERs.\nOur increases in unearned premiums year-over-year for the periods presented resulted from consecutive annual increases in single premiums written in 2014 and 2015. Net premiums earned in 2014 and 2015 also increased from the prior years, as a result of increases in new business, continued earnings from business written in prior years, and early cancellations related to single premium policies.\nMI may also be written in a pool policy, where a group of loans (or pool) are insured under one contract. Pool insurance may have a stated aggregate loss limit for a pool of loans and may also have a deductible under which no losses are paid by the insurer until losses on the pool of loans exceed the deductible.\n\n \u2022 the state of the economy, including unemployment, which affects the likelihood that borrowers may default on their loans; \nGSE Oversight\n \u2022 we expect that the frequency of claims on our initial primary books of business should be between 2% and 3% of mortgages insured over the life of the book. For claims that we may receive, we expect the severity of the claim to be between 85% and 95% of the coverage amount. Based on these expectations, we estimate that the loss ratio over the life of each book will be between 20% and 25% of earned premiums. Until our portfolio matures, we expect our reported loss ratio will be less than 10%, due to loss development being generally insignificant in the early years of a loan cycle combined with strong growth in earned premiums on a year-over-year basis; \nAs a result of NODs received in 2015, our reserves for insurance claims and claims expenses increased to $679 thousand at December 31, 2015 compared to $83 thousand at December 31, 2014. See, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reserves for Insurance Claims and Claims Expenses.\"\n\nEmployee compensation represents the majority of our operating expense, which includes both cash and share-based compensation. Our underwriting and operating expenses grew year-over-year primarily as the result of hiring new employees and expanding our operations and sales activities. Our headcount grew from 189 at December 31, 2014 to 243 at December 31, 2015. Underwriting and operating expenses also include costs related to policy acquisition, technology, professional services and facilities.\nUnder the PMIERs financial requirements, Approved Insurers must maintain available assets that equal or exceed minimum required assets, which is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $400 million or (ii) a total risk-based required asset amount. The risk-based required asset amount is a function of the risk profile of an Approved Insurer's net RIF, calculated by applying on a loan-by-loan basis certain risk-based factors derived from tables set out in the PMIERs to the net RIF. The risk-based required asset amount for primary insurance is subject to a floor of 5.6% of total, performing, primary RIF, and the risk-based required asset amount for pool insurance considers both the factors in the tables and the net remaining stop loss for each pool insurance policy. The PMIERs financial requirements also increase the amount of available assets that must be held by an Approved Insurer for loans originated on or after January 1, 2016 that are insured under LPMI policies not subject to automatic termination under the HOPA.\nCompetition with FHA\nOur net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7.2 million compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio conforms with our investment guidelines. The principal factors affecting our investment income include the size and credit rating of our portfolio and its net yield. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair market value, such as those resulting from changes in interest rates), the size of our investment portfolio is mainly a function of capital raised, cash generated from (or used in) operations, such as net premiums received, and investment earnings.\ncost basis of the security. In evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, we may consider several factors including, but not limited to:\nPortfolio Statistics\nRestricted Stock Units\nMI protects mortgage lenders from all or a portion of default-related losses on residential mortgage loans made to home buyers who generally make down payments of less than 20% of the home's purchase price. By protecting lenders and investors from credit losses, we help facilitate the availability of mortgages to prospective, primarily first-time, U.S. home buyers, thus promoting homeownership while protecting lenders and investors against potential losses related to a borrower's default. MI also facilitates the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market, most of which are sold to the GSEs. We are one of seven companies in the United States who offer MI. Our business strategy is to continue to gain market share with our principal focus on writing insurance on high quality, low down payment residential mortgages in the U.S.\nCustomer Development\nDividend Yield - is calculated by dividing the expected annual dividend by our stock price at the valuation date.\nClaims incurred are generally affected by:\nClaims incurred is the current expense that is booked within a particular period to reflect actual and estimated claim payments that we believe will ultimately be made as a result of insured loans that are in default. We do not recognize an estimate of claim expense for loans that are not in default. As of December 31, 2015, we have established reserves for insurance claims of $679 thousand for our thirty-six primary loans in default, compared to a reserve of $83 thousand for six primary loans in default as of December 31, 2014. We have not established any pool reserves for claims or IBNR to date. For additional discussion of our reserves, see, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6. Reserves for Insurance Claims and Claims Expenses.\"\nIn addition to GSE-imposed capital requirements, NMIC is also subject to state regulatory minimum capital requirements based on its insured RIF. While formulations of this minimum capital may vary in each jurisdiction, the most common measure allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1. As our insurance writings grow and our RIF increases, our RTC ratio will increase and NMIC's RTC metrics will become more important to an evaluation of its capital needs to support future business writings.\nInvestment Portfolio\nIf a premium deficiency exists, as described above, we reduce the related deferred insurance policy acquisition costs by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than the deferred insurance policy acquisition costs balance, we then establish a premium deficiency reserve equal to the excess, by means of a charge to current period earnings.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nNMIH has entered into expense-sharing agreements with its insurance subsidiaries which have been approved by the Wisconsin OCI, but such approval may be changed or revoked at any time. NMIC's ability to pay dividends to NMIH is subject to insurance regulations requiring insurance department approval. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \"extraordinary\" and require insurance regulatory approval. Since inception, NMIC has not paid any dividends to NMIH. As NMIC had a statutory net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014, NMIC cannot pay any dividends to NMIH through December 31,\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net premiums written of $114.2 million compared to net premiums written of $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We had net premiums written for our primary mortgage insurance products of $109.3 million, $28.6 million, and $1.7 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The principal driver of the increase in primary premiums written in 2014 and 2015 was the continued growth of our policies in force and the significant development of our customer base. As of December 31, 2015, we had 63,948 primary certificates in force and 18,955 pool certificates in force, compared to 14,603 primary certificates in force and 20,573 pool certificates in force as of December 31, 2014.\nNet realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2015 were offset by an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) loss of $88.6 thousand due to a planned sales transaction that we expect will result in a loss in February 2016.\n \u2022 declines in housing values, as such declines may negatively affect loss mitigation opportunities on loans in default, as well as increase the likelihood that borrowers will default when the value of the home is below or perceived to be below the mortgage balance; \nWe intend to build a geographically diverse portfolio without significant geographic concentrations that might expose us to undue risk. We manage geographic concentration risk by establishing targets and limits for new origination mix and/or portfolio limits. If warranted, we would also establish restrictions in certain geographic markets; although, we currently do not have any geographic market restrictions in place. We expect that our insurance origination mix by region will be consistent with the overall distribution of mortgage originations in the U.S. that require mortgage insurance.\nIn November 2015, we entered into the Credit Agreement and obtained the Term Loan. Our long-term debt balance under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2015 was $143.9 million.\nThe table below shows primary NIW, IIF, RIF, policies in force, the weighted average coverage and loans in default, by quarter, for the last five quarters.\nConsistent with industry accounting practices, for purposes of establishing claim reserves, we adhere to the general claim reserving principles contained in ASC Topic 944, Financial Services - Insurance (ASC 944), even though that standard expressly excludes mortgage insurance from its guidance. Like other mortgage insurers, we will not establish claim reserves for anticipated future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default.\nAssets classified as Level 1 and Level 2\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, 100% of our pool RIF was comprised of insurance on fixed rate mortgages.\nReserve for Insurance Claims\nInsurance claims and claims expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of an increase in our NODs from December 31, 2014, in addition to our payment of two claims paid during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 the size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts tending to increase claims incurred; \nThe pre-tax book yield on our portfolio, excluding unrealized gains and losses, was 1.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The book yield is calculated on our year-to-date net investment income over our average portfolio book value at December 31, 2015. We believe that the yield on our investment portfolio likely will change over time based on potential changes to the interest rate environment, the duration or mix of our investment portfolio or other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2015, NMIC's primary RIF was approximately $3.6 billion representing insurance on a total of 63,948 policies in force, and pool RIF was approximately $93.1 million, representing insurance on a total of 18,955 loans. Based on NMIC's reported total statutory capital of $395 million at December 31, 2015, NMIC's RTC ratio was 8.4:1, significantly below the regulatory maximum RTC thresholds. Similarly, Re One had total statutory capital of $29 million at December 31, 2015, with a RTC ratio of 12.6:1. As of December 31, 2015, under PMIERs financial requirements, NMIC's minimum required assets were approximately $249.8 million and its available assets were approximately $431.4 million.\nWe began investing our cash during the first quarter of 2013 and continued to invest and re-balance our portfolio in the second and third quarters of 2013. As a result, our net investment income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Additionally, net investment income was higher for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of an increase in our consolidated securities portfolio, from $336.5 million at December 31, 2014 to $559.2 million at December 31, 2015. Net realized investment gains also increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the re-balancing of our portfolio among a mix of investment categories.\nInvestment Securities - Other-than-Temporary Impairment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net premiums written of $114.2 million and premiums earned of $45.5 million, compared to net premiums written of $34.0 million and premiums earned of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had net premiums written of $3.5 million and premiums earned of $2.1 million. Premiums written and earned in a year are generally influenced by:\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $617 million in cash and investments of which $100.2 million was held at NMIH. During 2015, NMIH received $148.5 million in proceeds, net of debt discount, from drawing down on the $150 million Term Loan. We contributed a substantial portion of the proceeds to our insurance subsidiaries, which they used to purchase securities to support growth in RIF and meet the final PMIERs requirements, effective December 31, 2015. We were cash flow positive from operating activities in 2015, however our cash decreased from year-end 2014 as a result of investment purchases.\n \u2022 Maintain approved status and relationships with National Accounts who purchase loans from Regional Accounts. Retaining these approvals as an authorized MI provider enables Regional Accounts to sell loans with insurance from us to those National Accounts through their correspondent channels. Consequently, these relationships are critical to continuing to grow our business with Regional Accounts. \nWe maintain cyber errors and omissions coverage to limit our exposure if an incident occurs. This insurance provides coverage for (i) claims related to, among other things, unauthorized network or computer access, unintentional disclosure or misuse of personally identifiable information in our possession, unintentional failure to disclose a breach and (ii) certain costs related to privacy notification, crisis management, cyber extortion, data recovery and business interruption.\nThe following tables show the distribution by state of our IIF and RIF, for both primary and pool insurance. As of December 31, 2015, our IIF and RIF continues to be relatively more concentrated in California, primarily as a result of the location and timing of the acquisition of new customers. With the broadening of our customer base, the concentration of primary IIF and RIF in California has declined from over 16.0% for both as of the end of 2014, to 13.8% and 12.9%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The distribution of risk across the states as of December 31, 2015 is not necessarily representative of the geographic distribution we expect in the future. As we add new customers and receive greater allocations of business from our existing customers, we expect we will have increased flexibility to manage our state concentration levels.\nCash flow provided from financing activities totaled $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the proceeds, net of debt discount, of $148.5 million from the Term Loan. The cash inflows from the Term Loan were partially offset by payments of debt issuance costs and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards.\nWe incurred interest expense of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the Term Loan entered into during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nRisk Free Interest Rate - is the U.S. Treasury rate for the date of the grant having a term approximating the expected life of the option.\nThe GSEs are the principal purchasers of mortgages insured by MI companies.

The only reinsurance agreements we currently have in place are between NMIC and Re One, and they are for the sole purpose of allowing NMIC to comply with certain statutory requirements regarding the amount of risk an MI company may retain on any single MI policy.  In our industry, a \"book\" is a group of loans that an MI company insures in a particular period, normally a calendar year. In general, the majority of any underwriting profit (i.e., the earned premium revenue minus claims and expenses, excluding investment income) that a book generates occurs in the early years of the book, with the largest portion of the underwriting profit for that book realized in the first year. This pattern generally occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years of the book, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments), and by increasing losses. The earnings we record and the cash flow we receive vary based on the type of MI product and premium plan our customers select.\nTo determine the fair value of securities available-for-sale in Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, independent pricing sources have been utilized. One price is provided per security based on observable market data. To ensure securities are appropriately classified in the fair value hierarchy, we review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing sources and believe that their policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the issue valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded. A variety of inputs are utilized by the independent pricing sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including data published in market research publications. Inputs may be weighted differently for any security, and not all inputs are used for each security evaluation. Market indicators, industry and economic events are also considered. This information is evaluated using a multidimensional pricing model. Quality controls are performed by the independent pricing sources throughout this process, which include reviewing tolerance reports, trading information and data changes, and directional moves compared to market moves. This model combines all inputs to arrive at a value assigned to each security. We have not made any adjustments to the prices obtained from the independent pricing sources; however, we do perform quality checks and review the prices received.\nIn February 2013, the Board approved a modification to the vesting terms of approximately 400,000 granted and non-vested RSUs held by our employees. The modification to the vesting terms removed the market condition leaving the RSUs subject to a service condition only. The modification resulted in a change in the period over which compensation costs are recognized and prospective recognition of incremental compensation cost. Incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified using relevant valuation inputs as of the modification date.\nThe tables below reflect our total primary IIF, RIF and average loan size, by FICO.\n \u2022 Top 10, primarily National Accounts, representing approximately 19% of the MI market; \n \u2022 change in rating below investment grade; and \nIn the second quarter of 2015, the FHFA published final updated PMIERs that went into effect on December 31, 2015 (Effective Date) for existing, GSE-approved private mortgage insurers, i.e., Approved Insurers.

Although we expect our year-over-year expenses to increase as we grow our business, we ultimately expect that the majority of our operating expenses will be relatively fixed in the long term. When our business is mature, we expect an expense ratio (expenses to premiums earned) to fall into the industry range of 20% to 25%. Until our business matures, our expense ratio is expected to be significantly higher than this range given the low levels of premium written compared to our \"fixed\" costs customary to operating a mortgage insurance company.\nConditions and Trends Impacting Our Business\nEach fiscal quarter we perform reviews of our investments in order to determine whether declines in fair value below amortized cost are considered other-than-temporary in accordance with applicable guidance. Under the current guidance, a debt security impairment is deemed other-than-temporary if either it is intended that the security be sold, or it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery or we do not expect to collect cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized\n*Long-term debt relates to our $150 million Credit Agreement and includes future interest payments using the minimum interest rate of 8.50%.\nA tax effected valuation allowance of $66.4 million and $53.7 million was recorded at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, to reflect the amount of the deferred taxes that may not be realized. As the Company has limited history, management has not yet concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income. If we conclude the taxable income will be sufficient to release the valuation allowance, we would recognize an income tax benefit associated primarily with the carry forward of federal net operating losses and future share-based compensation tax deductions.\n \u2022 Next 30, a combination of National and Regional Accounts, representing approximately 17% of the MI market; and ", "item_7_text": "Costs directly associated with the successful acquisition of mortgage insurance policies, consisting of employee compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses, are initially deferred and reported as deferred insurance policy acquisition costs.

We had 964 Master Policy holders by the end of 2015, compared to 735 at the end of 2014. Of those Master Policy holders, 51.9% were delivering business in 2015, compared to 37.7% delivering business in 2014. We had total IIF of $19.1 billion and total RIF of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2015, compared to total IIF of $8.1 billion and total RIF of $894.7 million as of December 31, 2014. Of total IIF as of December 31, 2015, we had $14.8 billion of primary IIF and $4.2 billion of pool IIF, compared to $3.4 billion of primary IIF and $4.7 billion of pool IIF as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, our primary RIF was $3.6 billion compared to primary RIF of $801.6 million as of December 31, 2014. Pool RIF was $93.1 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn recent years, the MI industry has been in a state of transition. There are now seven MI companies serving the mortgage market. Given this dynamic, we expect that the pressure for industry participants to grow or maintain their market share will continue in the coming years.

The increase at December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of our increased headcount, accrued premium taxes, an increase in IT projects and expenses, as well as accrued interest expense related to the Term Loan. We also had an investment payable of $3.2 million as of December 31, 2015.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe sectors of our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents appear in the table below: \nThe ratings of our investment portfolio were:\nOur ability to continue to make progress attaining and retaining customers is primarily dependent on the following factors:\n \u2022 cancellations, which reduce IIF. Upon cancellation of a policy, all premium that is non-refundable is immediately earned, and any refundable premium is returned to the policyholder. Cancellations due to refinancings are affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on our IIF. Refinancings are also affected by current home values compared to values when the loans became insured and the terms on which mortgage credit is available. To a lesser extent, cancellations also result from claim payments, as we return any premium received from the servicer after the date the insured mortgage defaults. Finally, cancellations are affected by home price appreciation, which may give homeowners the right to cancel the MI on their loans. Based on current market conditions, we expect our MI policies to have a persistency rate of between 80% and 85%; \nOur deferred policy acquisition asset was $17.5 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $3.0 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was driven by the increase in deferrable costs associated with our increase in premiums written year over year from $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or a geographic area.  Premium Deficiency Reserve\n \u2022 the product mix of IIF, with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher defaults and claims; \nOn an ongoing and recurring basis, we evaluate changing market conditions to determine if it is appropriate to establish, tighten, loosen or eliminate lending restrictions established by geographic area. The evaluation is expected to include factors such as historical performance and the historical performance of other market participants, forward-looking projections for key risk drivers, estimated impact on loss performance and existing portfolio concentrations. Consistent with our governance processes, the geographic concentrations will be monitored on an ongoing basis and changes to market restrictions will be reviewed and approved.\nmeaning that such terms have in the PMIERs, as described below.) The PMIERs establish operational, business, remedial and financial requirements applicable to Approved Insurers. The new financial requirements prescribe a risk-based capital methodology whereby the amount of capital required to be held against each insured loan is determined based on certain risk characteristics, such as FICO, vintage (year of origination), performing vs. non-performing, LTV and other risk features. A capital charge is calculated for each insured loan based on its risk profile. In general, higher quality loans carry lower capital charges.\n \u2022 NIW, which is the new IIF (aggregate principal amount of the mortgages) that are insured during a period. Many factors affect NIW, including, among others, the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations (which tend to be generated to a greater extent in purchase financings as compared to refinancings) and the competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages, which includes primarily competition from the FHA and other private mortgage insurers; \nRevenues\nThere is a tax sharing agreement between NMIH and its subsidiaries, dated August 23, 2012. Under this agreement, each of the parties mutually agreed to file a consolidated federal income tax return for 2012 and subsequent tax years, with NMIH as the direct tax filer. The tax liability of each subsidiary that is party to the agreement is limited to the amount of liability it would incur if it filed a separate tax return. Any settlements under the agreement between NMIH and a subsidiary will be made within 30 days of the filing of the applicable federal corporate income tax return with the IRS, including subsequent amended filings and IRS adjustments, except when a refund is due to a subsidiary, in which case payment shall be made to such subsidiary within 30 days after NMIH's receipt of the applicable tax refund.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $230.2 million, compared to cash provided in the same period in 2014 of $68.1 million This was a result of security acquisitions during 2015, primarily from the proceeds of the Loan.\nThe MI industry is highly competitive and currently consists of seven private mortgage insurers, including NMIC, as well as governmental agencies like the FHA and the VA. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business - Sales and Marketing and Competition - Competition.\"\n \u2022 Approximately 1,500, primarily Regional Accounts, representing the remainder of the MI market.  Since April 2013, we have increased our customer base, and we expect to continue to acquire new customers. As of December 31, 2015, we had active customer relationships with 22 of the top 40 lenders and expect to develop additional active customer relationships. We believe our most significant growth opportunity is within the the large and fragmented market of Regional Accounts, which includes some of the top correspondent lenders. As of December 31, 2015, our active customer relationships give us access to over 83% of the correspondent origination market. In addition to adding new customers, we believe existing customers will begin to allocate more of their business to us for placement of our MI.\n\n \u2022 Maintain our connections and continue our progress in connecting with leading third-party loan origination systems utilized by Regional Accounts. This will allow the Regional Accounts who originate loans using these third-party loan origination systems to automatically select us as an MI provider within those platforms.  New Insurance Written, Insurance in Force and Premiums\n \u2022 the rate at which we rescind policies. Because of tighter underwriting standards generally in the mortgage lending industry and the terms of our Master Policy, we expect that our level of rescission activity will be lower than recent rescission activity experienced by the MI industry; and \n \u2022 under the pool insurance agreement between NMIC and Fannie Mae, NMIC is responsible for claims only to the extent they exceed a deductible; and \nThe estimated grant date fair values of the stock options granted during 2015 and 2014 were calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model based on the following assumptions:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nExpected Life - is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules, historical exercise and forfeiture patterns. We use the simplified method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 to estimate expected lives for options granted during the period as historical exercise data is not available and the options meet the requirements set out in the Bulletin. Options granted have a maximum term of ten years.\nIn November 2015, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) assigned a financial strength rating of \"Ba2\" to NMIC. Also at that time, Moody's assigned a B2 rating to the $150 million Term Loan held by NMIH. Moody's outlook for both companies is \"stable.\"\nGoing forward, by April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. Moreover, NMIC has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of its failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements. We will continue to monitor our compliance with the PMIERs going forward.\nWe wrote our first MI policy in April 2013. We do not anticipate a material level of claims (relative to written premiums or stockholder equity) in the first few years of our operations. Our practice is to establish claim reserves only for loans in default. We do not consider a loan to be in default for claim reserve purposes until we receive notice from the servicer that a borrower has failed to make two consecutive regularly scheduled payments and is at least sixty days in default. Default is defined in our Master Policy as the failure by a borrower to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled mortgage payment due under the terms of a loan or the failure by a borrower to pay all amounts due under a loan after the exercise of the due on sale clause of such loan. In addition to reserves on reported defaults, we establish IBNR reserves for estimated claims incurred on loans that have been in default for at least sixty days that have not yet been reported to us by the servicers.\n \u2022 failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; \nNet Loss\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nNMIH serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. NMIH's principal liquidity demands include funds for: (i) payment of certain corporate expenses and reimbursable expenses of its insurance subsidiaries; (ii) capital support for its insurance subsidiaries; (iii) potential payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); (iv) the payment of dividends, if any, on its common stock; and (iv) the payment of principal and interest related to the Term Loan. NMIH is not subject to any limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations, such as NMIH, that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware corporation law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation's capital surplus or (subject to certain limitations) recent net profits. As of December 31, 2015, NMIH's shareholders' equity was approximately $403 million.\n \u2022 the product mix of our book of business, which includes recurring monthly premiums earned for monthly policies and the recognition of premiums earned from the amortization of our single premiums over the policies' lives. We expect our product mix and the average premium rate we charge to be comparable with the industry in general as our business matures; \nThe guidance regarding the recognition and presentation of other-than temporary impairment (OTTI) requires that an OTTI of a debt security be separated into two components when there are credit-related losses associated with the impaired debt security for which we assert that we do not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before recovery of our cost basis. Under this guidance, the amount of the OTTI related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount of the OTTI related to other factors (such as changes in interest rates or market conditions) is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). In instances where no credit loss exists but it is more likely than not that we would have to sell the debt security prior to the anticipated recovery, the decline in fair value below amortized cost is recognized as an OTTI in earnings. In periods after recognition of an OTTI on debt securities, we account for such securities as if they had been purchased on the measurement date of the OTTI at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings. For debt securities for which OTTI are recognized in earnings, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected would be accreted or amortized into net investment income.\nCapital Position of Our Insurance Subsidiaries\nNMIC's primary insurance may be written on a flow basis, in which loans are insured in individual, loan-by-loan transactions, or on an aggregated basis, in which each loan in a portfolio of loans is individually insured in a single transaction.\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included below in Item 8 of this report and the Risk Factors included above in Part I, Item 1A of this report. In addition, investors should review the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" above.\n\nOperating activities generated positive cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the collection of premiums offset by the continued hiring of management and staff personnel and costs for contract and professional services.\nGeographic Dispersion\nPrimary NIW in 2015 increased 260% from the prior year as a result of an increase in customers with approved master policies as well as an increase in our primary flow business for the year ended December 31, 2015. Single NIW in 2015 increased 216% over the prior year due to greater lender demand for our single premium LPMI products. Single premiums written on an aggregated basis were 20% of total NIW in 2015, down from 46% in the prior year. Monthly NIW in 2015 increased 323% over the prior year as a result of new account activation and continued penetration of existing customer accounts.\nWe adopted ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 addresses accounting for share-based awards and recognizes compensation expense, measured using grant date fair value, over the requisite service or performance period of the award. Share-based payments include stock options and restricted stock unit (RSU) grants under the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan and the NMIH 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The fair value of stock option grants issued are determined based on an option pricing model which takes into account various assumptions that are subjective. Key assumptions used in the stock option valuation include the fair value of the stock on the grant date, the expected term of the equity award taking into account the contractual term of the award, the effects of expected exercise and post-vesting termination behavior, expected volatility, expected dividends and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award. RSU grants to certain employees contain a market and service condition. The fair value of RSU grants to employees prior to our IPO was determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation model at the date of grant. Following the IPO, fair value was determined based on closing price on the grant date. Restricted grants to non-employee directors are valued at our stock price on the date of grant less the present value of anticipated dividends. Expense is recognized over the required service period, which is generally a three-year vesting period for the options (vesting in one-third increments per year).\n\nState insurance regulators also have the authority to make changes to capital requirements. The NAIC has formed a working group to develop and recommend more robust regulations governing mortgage insurance, including, among other things, strengthened capital requirements, underwriting standards, claims practices and market conduct. We, along with other MI companies, are working with the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Working Group of the Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC (Working Group). The Working Group will determine and make a recommendation to the Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC as to what changes the Working Group believes are necessary to the solvency and market practices regulation of MI companies, including changes to the Mortgage Guaranty Insurers Model Act (Model #630). We have provided feedback to the Working Group since early 2013. The Working Group's discussions are ongoing and the ultimate outcome of these discussions and any potential actions taken by the NAIC cannot be predicted at this time. If the Working Group proposes that the NAIC adopt more stringent capital requirements, this could ultimately lead to NMIC being obligated to hold more capital for its insured business than we are required to holder under PMIERs, which would reduce our profitability compared to the profitability we expect under the existing capital requirements.\nThe table below reflects the percentage of our primary RIF by loan type.\nThe table below reflects a summary of our primary IIF and RIF by book year.\n\nOur warrant liability decreased to $1.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.4 million at December 31, 2014, as a result of a decline in our stock price during 2015.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe monitor the concentrations of various risk attributes in our insurance portfolio. Generally, insuring loans made to borrowers with higher credit scores tends to result in a lower frequency of claims than with loans made to borrowers with lower credit scores. As of December 31, 2015, our primary IIF and RIF were made up of approximately 64.3% and 64.1%, respectively, of loans to borrowers who had credit scores at or above 740. Our primary weighted average FICO for NIW in the year ended December 31, 2015 was 752. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, all loans in our insurance portfolio were full documentation loans, and approximately 4% of our RIF was on loans above 95% LTV. Our primary weighted average LTV for NIW in the year ended December 31, 2015 was 91%.\n \u2022 Level 2 - Prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets \n\nIn the MI industry, a \"book\" is a group of loans that an MI company insures in a particular period, normally a calendar year. We set premiums at the time a policy is issued based on our expectations regarding likely performance over the term of coverage. The policies we write are guaranteed renewable contracts at the policyholder's option on a single, annual or monthly premium basis. We generally have no ability to re-underwrite or reprice these contracts. Premiums written on a single premium basis and an annual premium basis are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and earned over the policy term commencing in the month coverage begins. Premiums written on policies covering more than one year are amortized over the policy life in accordance with the expiration of risk which is the anticipated claim payment pattern based on industry experience. Premiums written on annual policies are earned on a monthly pro rata basis. Premiums written on monthly policies are earned as coverage is provided. Premiums written on pool transactions are earned over the period that coverage is provided. Upon cancellation of a policy, all premium that is non-refundable is immediately earned. Any refundable premium is returned to the policyholder. Premiums returned to policyholders are recorded as a reduction of written and earned premiums in the current period, which affects premiums written and earned in those periods.\n \u2022 Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $139.4 million, which expires from 2029 to 2035, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $47.0 million, which primarily expires from 2031 to 2035. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) imposes annual limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize its net operating losses (NOLs) if it experiences an ownership change.\u201d As a result of the acquisition of our insurance subsidiaries, $7.3 million of NOLs are subject to annual limitations of $0.8 million through 2016, then $0.3 million through 2029. If the Company were to experience another ownership change,\u201d further limitations would apply.\n\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. The liability method measures the expected future tax effects of temporary differences at the enacted tax rates applicable for the period in which the deferred asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements that would result in future increases or decreases in taxes owed on a cash basis compared to amounts already recognized as tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. We evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In the course of our review, we assess all available evidence, both positive and negative, including future sources of income, tax planning strategies, future contractual cash flows and reversing temporary differences. Additional valuation allowance benefits or charges could be recognized in the future due to changes in management's expectations regarding the realization of tax benefits.\n \u2022 the typical distribution of claims over the life of a book results in fewer defaults during the first two years after loans are originated, usually peaking in years three through six and declining thereafter; \nOur other assets balance increased from $9.0 million at December 31, 2014 to $13.2 million as of December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in our premiums receivable balance related to our monthly policies.\nIn recent years, the level of competition within the private MI industry has been intense and is not expected to diminish. Lenders have requested discounts from mortgage insurers with greater frequency, particularly with respect to LPMI single premium policies. A significant percentage of our total business to date has consisted of single premium policies, some of which has been written at a discounted rate, which may impact our premium yields in the near term. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented new LPMI and BPMI rates, which we expect will improve premium yields on our future NIW and have the effect of increasing the amount of monthly NIW as a percentage of our total mix over time.\n\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2015. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 are summarized in the table that follows.\nThe following table reflects the percentage and policy count of our RIF by LTV. We calculate the LTV of a loan as a percentage of the original loan amount to the original value of the property securing the loan. In general, the lower the LTV the lower the likelihood of a default, and for loans that default, a lower LTV generally results in lower severity for a resulting claim, as the borrower has more equity in the property.\n \u2022 the distribution of claims over the life of a book. Historically, the first two to three years after loans are originated are a period of relatively low claims, with claims increasing substantially for several years subsequent and then declining. Factors, such as persistency of the book, the condition of the economy, including unemployment and housing prices, and others, can affect this pattern.  We expect that claims incurred for the early years of our operations will be relatively low for the following reasons:\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1, \"Business - Customers,\" our sales and marketing strategy is focused on increasing market share from existing customers and attracting new mortgage originator customers in the U.S. that fall into two primary categories, which we refer to as \"National Accounts\" and \"Regional Accounts.\"\n\nTaxes\nOverview\nOur persistency rate is the percentage of policies in force that remains on our books after any twelve-month period. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, changes in persistency rates can have a significant impact on our earnings. The persistency rate on our portfolio was 84.1% at December 31, 2015. In recent quarters, we have experienced high volumes of single premium policy cancellations driven by refinance activity, which has contributed to lower persistency than generally expected. We believe single premium policy cancellations will decrease if interest rates rise.\nWe classify our entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale and report it at fair value. The related unrealized gains or losses, after considering the related tax expense or benefit, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. We expect to hold short-term investments with maturities of greater than three and less than 12 months when purchased, and such investments will be carried at fair value. Any realized gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on a specific-identification basis. We expect that our investment income will consist primarily of interest. We recognize interest income on an accrual basis. Net investment income would represent interest income, net of investment expenses.\nAlthough there has been broad policy consensus toward the need for private capital to play a larger role and government credit risk to be reduced in the U.S. housing finance system, recent action by the current administration has made it difficult to predict whether the market share of governmental agencies such as the FHA and VA will recede to historical levels. On January 26, 2015, the FHA reduced some of its single-family annual mortgage insurance premiums. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact from this premium reduction on our business. It is difficult to predict what, if any, material impact this premium reduction will have in the future as there are factors beyond premium rate that influence a lender's decision to choose private MI over FHA insurance, including among others, the FHA's loan eligibility requirements and loan size limits and the relative ease of use of private MI products compared to FHA products. However, we believe our pricing continues to be more attractive than the FHA's pricing for a substantial majority of borrowers with credit and loan characteristics similar to those whose loans we insure.\nReserve for Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\n\n \u2022 low NIW in our early years of operations.  We developed our estimates of the expected frequency and severity of claims based on statutory filings by many of our competitors, which contain historical book year performance, as well as an industry dataset which consists of nearly 150 million mortgages and 80 data fields per mortgage, gathered over the past 17 years. As state-regulated entities, mortgage insurers are required to file actuarial justifications for premium rate changes in many states, many of which are publicly available and include historical information on claim frequency and severity. Historical performance data from similar underwriting, house price, and interest rate periods were compared to today to determine a range of expected performance. To date, our loss experience is developing at a slower pace than historical trends have shown, primarily as a result of the relatively strong economy, which has led to a more favorable housing market and lower interest rates.\nThe estimated grant date fair values of the RSUs granted in 2012 that are subject to both a market and service condition were calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model based on the average outcome of 150,000 simulations using the following assumptions:\nAs a participant in the mortgage lending and MI industries, we rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide and expand our products and services. We have established and implemented security measures, controls and procedures to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed and/or stored in such systems. We periodically employ third parties to evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, controls and procedures. In addition, we have established a business continuity plan that is designed to allow our business to continue to operate in the midst of certain disruptive events, including any disruptions to our information technology systems. We also have an incident response plan that is designed to address information security incidents, including breaches of our information technology systems. Despite these safeguards, disruptions to and breaches of our information technology systems are possible and may negatively impact our business.\nand liabilities; and\nOur unearned premiums balance increased from $22.1 million as of December 31, 2014 to $90.8 million as of December 31, 2015 due to single premiums written in 2015, offset by cancellations of LPMI policies previously discussed and earnings of existing unearned premiums in accordance with the expiration of risk in the related policies.\n\nASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires all entities to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.\nWarrants\nIn July 2015, Standard & Poor's (S&P) Ratings Services assigned its \"BBB-\" financial strength and long-term counter-party credit ratings to NMIC. At the same time, S&P assigned its \"BB-\" long-term counter-party credit rating to NMIH. S&P's outlook for both companies is \"stable.\"\n\n\nExpected Stock Price Volatility - is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. At the time of grants, our common shares trading history was not sufficient to calculate an expected volatility representative of the volatility over the expected lives of the options. As a substitute for such estimate, we used historical volatilities of a set of comparable companies in the industry in which we operate.\nCybersecurity\nGiven our growth during 2015, we believe that a quarter-over-quarter comparison of net premiums written is more meaningful than comparing net premiums written year-over-year. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we had net premiums written of $45.6 million and net premiums earned of $16.9 million, compared to net premiums written of $35.4 million and net premiums earned of $12.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we had net monthly premiums written and earned of $9.6 million compared to $7.3 million for the third quarter of 2015.\nWe set premiums at the time a policy is issued based on our expectations regarding likely performance over the term of coverage. We offer BPMI and LPMI options. Premium rates are based on the risk characteristics of each insured loan and the capital required to support particular products. Capital charges are governed by the updated PMIERs and for LPMI policies, will increase in 2016. See \"- GSE Oversight,\" below.\nNMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH), a Delaware corporation incorporated in May 2011 provides private mortgage guaranty insurance (which we refer to as \"mortgage insurance\" or \"MI\") through its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries. Our primary insurance subsidiary, National Mortgage Insurance Corporation (NMIC), is a qualified MI provider on loans purchased by the GSEs and is licensed in all 50 states and D.C. to issue MI. Our reinsurance subsidiary, National Mortgage Reinsurance Inc One (Re One), solely provides reinsurance to NMIC on certain loans insured by NMIC, as described in Note 14, Statutory Information - Reinsurance, below. NMIH's wholly owned subsidiary, NMI Services, Inc. (NMIS), began offering outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol \"NMIH.\"\n\nOur MI companies' principal operating sources of liquidity are premiums that we receive from policies and income generated by our investment portfolio. Our MI companies' primary liquidity needs include the payment of claims on our MI policies, operating expenses, investment expenses and other costs of our business. We anticipate that as our IIF grows, the premium revenue we receive will increase. We expect to manage our fixed operating expenses so that they grow at a slower rate than sales over the coming years.\n \u2022 the percentage of coverage on insured loans, with higher percentages of insurance coverage tending to result in higher incurred claim amounts than lower percentages of insurance coverage; \n (2) End of period RIF divided by IIF.  We utilize certain risk principles that form the basis of how we underwrite and originate primary NIW. We manage our portfolio credit risk by using several loan eligibility matrices which prescribe the maximum LTV, minimum borrower credit score, maximum loan size, property type and occupancy status of loans that we will insure. Our loan eligibility matrices, as well as all of our detailed underwriting guidelines, are contained in our Underwriting Guideline Manual that is publicly available on our website. Our eligibility criteria and underwriting guidelines are designed to mitigate the layered risk inherent in a single insurance policy. \"Layered risk\" refers to the accumulation of borrower, loan and property risk. For example, we have higher credit score and lower maximum allowed LTV requirements for riskier property types, such as investor properties, compared to owner-occupied properties.\n \u2022 our intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery; \nWe have incurred significant net operating losses since our inception; however,we have seen our net losses decrease steadily as our business has grown. Our net losses were $27.8 million, $48.9 million and $55.2 million for the each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The primary driver of the decreases in net losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 compared to the prior years was the significant increase in premiums earned as a result of the addition of new customers and higher allocations of business to us from existing customers, slightly offset by the continued hiring of management and staff personnel and external and professional costs.\n (1) Reported as of the end of the period. \nThe table below reflects a summary of the change in total primary IIF for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nCompetition\n2015 without the prior approval of the Wisconsin OCI. Certain other states in which NMIC is licensed also have statutes or regulations that restrict its ability to pay dividends.\nWe recorded no income tax for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $2.4 million of income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9, Income Taxes.\"\nWe offer monthly, annual and single premium payment plans. Policies written on a single premium basis are paid through a single, upfront payment, the majority of which is initially deferred as unearned premium and earned over the policy term. For monthly policies, premiums are earned and collected each month as coverage is provided.\nConsistent with Wisconsin law, our investment policies emphasize preservation of capital, as well as total return. Based on our guidelines, our current investment portfolio is comprised almost entirely of cash and cash equivalents and fixed-income securities, all of which are investment grade. Prior to the third quarter of 2014, our investment portfolio consisted of A rated securities or better. During the third quarter of 2014, we changed our investment guidelines to allow 10-15% of the investment portfolio to be invested in BBB securities. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 13% of the investment portfolio was invested in BBB securities. Our policy guidelines contain limits on the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. We expect to preserve the liquidity of our portfolio through diversification and investment in publicly traded securities. We plan to maintain a level of liquidity commensurate with our perceived business outlook and the expected timing, direction and degree of changes in interest rates.\nExpenses\nNMIH's future capital requirements depend on many factors, including NMIC's ability to successfully write new business, establish premium rates at levels sufficient to cover claims and operating costs and meet minimum required asset thresholds under the PMIERs. See \"Conditions and Trends Impacting our Business - GSE Oversight,\" above. We expect NMIH may make additional capital contributions to its insurance subsidiaries to support their applicable capital adequacy requirements from time-to-time. To the extent that the funds generated by our ongoing operations and capitalization are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financing activities, reduce our RIF, including through reinsurance arrangements, or curtail our growth and reduce our expenses. We may choose to generate additional liquidity through the issuance of debt, equity, or a combination of both. Any such future capital raise would be conducted by means of a separate prospectus or other appropriate offering document and not by means of this report.\nWe had net single premiums written and earned of $34.8 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to net single premiums written and earned of $26.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2015. Net single premiums earned increased as a result of an increase in single premiums written during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, as well as from cancellations on LPMI singles, which are non-refundable and fully earned upon cancellation. Net pool premiums written and earned of $1.2 million for both during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was down slightly quarter over quarter due to the pay off of approximately 341 loans in the pool from September 30, 2015. We have not written significant annual premiums through December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 the LTV ratio, with higher average LTV ratios tending to increase claims incurred; \nOur software and equipment balance increased from $11.8 million at December 31, 2014 to $15.2 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the $6.1 million spent on the continued development of our technology platform to support the growth of our business.\nHolding Company Liquidity and Capital Resources\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLiabilities classified as Level 3\nIncome Taxes\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, NMIH entered into the Credit Agreement to obtain the Term Loan in the amount of $150 million in order to support the continued growth of its IIF. The Credit Agreement contains various restrictive covenants and required financial ratios and tests that we are required to meet or maintain. The Term Loan bears interest at the Eurodollar based rate (1%) plus an annual margin rate of 7.5%, payable quarterly. The Company recorded $1.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Term Loan matures on November 10, 2018.\nConsolidated Investment Portfolio\n\nWe perform a premium deficiency calculation each fiscal quarter using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date. Per ASC 944, a premium deficiency reserve shall be recognized if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses, expected dividends to policyholders, unamortized acquisition costs, and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums. The calculation of premium deficiency reserves requires the use of significant judgment and estimates to determine the present value of future premiums and present value of expected claims and expenses on our business. The present value of future premiums relies on, among other things, assumptions about persistency and repayment patterns on underlying loans. The present value of expected claims and expenses depends on assumptions relating to severity of claims, claim rates on current defaults and expected defaults in future periods. These assumptions may also include an estimate of expected rescission activity. Assumptions used in calculating premium deficiency reserves can be affected by volatility in the current housing and mortgage lending industries. To the extent premium patterns and actual claim experience differ from the assumptions used in calculating a premium deficiency reserve, the differences between the actual results and our estimate will affect future period earnings. In considering the potential sensitivity of the factors underlying our best estimate of premium deficiency reserves, it is possible that even a relatively small change in estimated claim rate or a relatively small percentage change in estimated claim amount could have a significant impact on establishing a premium deficiency reserve, should one be needed, and, correspondingly, on our operating results.\nFor RSUs which are subject to a service condition, expense is recognized over the required service period, which is generally a three-year vesting period (vesting in one-third increments per year). Expense is measured by multiplying the number of RSUs by the grant date fair value.\n \u2022 premium rates, which are based on the risk characteristics of the loans insured, the percentage of coverage on the loans, competition from other mortgage insurers and general industry conditions; and \nThe lenders in the combined residential mortgage market who control the MI decision are currently comprised of three groups:\nThe table below shows primary and pool IIF, NIW and premiums written and earned. Single NIW and IIF includes policies written on an aggregated and flow basis.\nWe discuss below our results of operations for the periods presented, as well as the conditions and trends that have impacted or are expected to impact our business, including customer development, new business writings, the composition of our insurance portfolio, and other factors that we expect to impact our results.\n\nThe ratings above are provided by one or more of: Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. If three ratings are available, we assign the middle rating for classification purposes, otherwise we assign the lowest rating.\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, NMIH had $100.2 million of cash and investments. NMIH's principal source of operating cash is investment income, and could include future dividends from NMIC, if available and permitted under law or our agreements with the GSEs and state regulators.\nThe establishment of claim and IBNR reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. We establish claim reserves using our best estimates of claim rates, i.e., the percent of loan defaults that ultimately result in claim payments, and claim amounts, i.e., the dollar amounts required to settle claims, to estimate the ultimate claims on loans reported to us as being at least sixty days in default as of the end of each reporting period. We estimate IBNR by analyzing historical lags in default reporting to determine a specific number of IBNR claims in each reporting period. We utilize internal and external data to estimate lags in NOD reporting. Additionally, our estimates of claim rates and claim sizes are strongly influenced by prevailing economic conditions, for example current rates or trends in unemployment, house price appreciation and/or interest rates, and our best judgment as to the future values or trends of these macroeconomic factors.\n\nWe are a U.S. taxpayer and are subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of approximately 35%. Our holding company files a consolidated U.S. federal and various state income tax returns on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries. Our effective income tax rate on our pre-tax loss was 0.0% , 4.7% and 0.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For further information regarding income taxes and their impact on our results of operations and financial position, see, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9, Income Taxes.\"\nWe account for warrants to purchase our common shares in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC 815-40 Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. Our outstanding warrants may be settled by us using either (i) a physical settlement method or (ii) cashless exercise, where shares that are issued upon exercise of the warrants are reduced to cover the cost of the exercise, in lieu of the holder remitting a cash payment of the exercise price. The warrants expire after the 10th anniversary of the dates they were issued, after which they are not exercisable. The exercise price and the number of warrants are subject to anti-dilution provisions whereby the existing exercise price is adjusted downward, and the number of warrants increased, for events that may not be dilutive. The adjustment may be in excess of any dilution suffered. As a result, the warrants are classified as a liability. We revalue the warrants at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is reported in the statements of operations in the period in which the change occurred. The fair value of the warrants is calculated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model in combination with a binomial model. We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the pricing protection features within the warrants. Variables in the model include the fair value of the stock, risk-free rate of return, dividend yield, expected life and expected volatility of the Company's stock price.\nWe established a fair value hierarchy by prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under this standard are described below:\nWe use accounting principles and methods that conform to GAAP. Where GAAP specifically excludes mortgage insurance we follow general industry practices. We are required to apply significant judgment and make material estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and with regard to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Assumptions and estimates are required to apply these principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical. These critical accounting policies and estimates are summarized below.\n \u2022 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.  The level of market activity used to determine the fair value hierarchy is based on the availability of observable inputs market participants would use to price an asset or a liability, including market value price observations.\nThe following describes the valuation techniques used by us to determine the fair value of financial instruments held as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, NMIH raised additional capital by entering into the Credit Agreement to obtain the Term Loan in the amount of $150 million. Concurrently with the closing of the Credit Agreement, NMIH borrowed $150 million from the facility and subsequently made contributions to NMIC of $145.4 million of cash and securities during the fourth quarter to support growth in NMIC's RIF and meet the final PMIERs requirements as of the Effective Date. As a result, as of December 31, 2015, NMIC had sufficient assets to meet the PMIERs financial requirements and we expect to certify to the GSEs by March 1, 2016 that NMIC fully complies with the PMIERs.\nOur increases in unearned premiums year-over-year for the periods presented resulted from consecutive annual increases in single premiums written in 2014 and 2015. Net premiums earned in 2014 and 2015 also increased from the prior years, as a result of increases in new business, continued earnings from business written in prior years, and early cancellations related to single premium policies.\nMI may also be written in a pool policy, where a group of loans (or pool) are insured under one contract. Pool insurance may have a stated aggregate loss limit for a pool of loans and may also have a deductible under which no losses are paid by the insurer until losses on the pool of loans exceed the deductible.\n\n \u2022 the state of the economy, including unemployment, which affects the likelihood that borrowers may default on their loans; \nGSE Oversight\n \u2022 we expect that the frequency of claims on our initial primary books of business should be between 2% and 3% of mortgages insured over the life of the book. For claims that we may receive, we expect the severity of the claim to be between 85% and 95% of the coverage amount. Based on these expectations, we estimate that the loss ratio over the life of each book will be between 20% and 25% of earned premiums. Until our portfolio matures, we expect our reported loss ratio will be less than 10%, due to loss development being generally insignificant in the early years of a loan cycle combined with strong growth in earned premiums on a year-over-year basis; \nAs a result of NODs received in 2015, our reserves for insurance claims and claims expenses increased to $679 thousand at December 31, 2015 compared to $83 thousand at December 31, 2014. See, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reserves for Insurance Claims and Claims Expenses.\"\n\nEmployee compensation represents the majority of our operating expense, which includes both cash and share-based compensation. Our underwriting and operating expenses grew year-over-year primarily as the result of hiring new employees and expanding our operations and sales activities. Our headcount grew from 189 at December 31, 2014 to 243 at December 31, 2015. Underwriting and operating expenses also include costs related to policy acquisition, technology, professional services and facilities.\nUnder the PMIERs financial requirements, Approved Insurers must maintain available assets that equal or exceed minimum required assets, which is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $400 million or (ii) a total risk-based required asset amount. The risk-based required asset amount is a function of the risk profile of an Approved Insurer's net RIF, calculated by applying on a loan-by-loan basis certain risk-based factors derived from tables set out in the PMIERs to the net RIF. The risk-based required asset amount for primary insurance is subject to a floor of 5.6% of total, performing, primary RIF, and the risk-based required asset amount for pool insurance considers both the factors in the tables and the net remaining stop loss for each pool insurance policy. The PMIERs financial requirements also increase the amount of available assets that must be held by an Approved Insurer for loans originated on or after January 1, 2016 that are insured under LPMI policies not subject to automatic termination under the HOPA.\nCompetition with FHA\nOur net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7.2 million compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio conforms with our investment guidelines. The principal factors affecting our investment income include the size and credit rating of our portfolio and its net yield. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair market value, such as those resulting from changes in interest rates), the size of our investment portfolio is mainly a function of capital raised, cash generated from (or used in) operations, such as net premiums received, and investment earnings.\ncost basis of the security. In evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, we may consider several factors including, but not limited to:\nPortfolio Statistics\nRestricted Stock Units\nMI protects mortgage lenders from all or a portion of default-related losses on residential mortgage loans made to home buyers who generally make down payments of less than 20% of the home's purchase price. By protecting lenders and investors from credit losses, we help facilitate the availability of mortgages to prospective, primarily first-time, U.S. home buyers, thus promoting homeownership while protecting lenders and investors against potential losses related to a borrower's default. MI also facilitates the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market, most of which are sold to the GSEs. We are one of seven companies in the United States who offer MI. Our business strategy is to continue to gain market share with our principal focus on writing insurance on high quality, low down payment residential mortgages in the U.S.\nCustomer Development\nDividend Yield - is calculated by dividing the expected annual dividend by our stock price at the valuation date.\nClaims incurred are generally affected by:\nClaims incurred is the current expense that is booked within a particular period to reflect actual and estimated claim payments that we believe will ultimately be made as a result of insured loans that are in default. We do not recognize an estimate of claim expense for loans that are not in default. As of December 31, 2015, we have established reserves for insurance claims of $679 thousand for our thirty-six primary loans in default, compared to a reserve of $83 thousand for six primary loans in default as of December 31, 2014. We have not established any pool reserves for claims or IBNR to date. For additional discussion of our reserves, see, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6. Reserves for Insurance Claims and Claims Expenses.\"\nIn addition to GSE-imposed capital requirements, NMIC is also subject to state regulatory minimum capital requirements based on its insured RIF. While formulations of this minimum capital may vary in each jurisdiction, the most common measure allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1. As our insurance writings grow and our RIF increases, our RTC ratio will increase and NMIC's RTC metrics will become more important to an evaluation of its capital needs to support future business writings.\nInvestment Portfolio\nIf a premium deficiency exists, as described above, we reduce the related deferred insurance policy acquisition costs by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than the deferred insurance policy acquisition costs balance, we then establish a premium deficiency reserve equal to the excess, by means of a charge to current period earnings.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nNMIH has entered into expense-sharing agreements with its insurance subsidiaries which have been approved by the Wisconsin OCI, but such approval may be changed or revoked at any time. NMIC's ability to pay dividends to NMIH is subject to insurance regulations requiring insurance department approval. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \"extraordinary\" and require insurance regulatory approval. Since inception, NMIC has not paid any dividends to NMIH. As NMIC had a statutory net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014, NMIC cannot pay any dividends to NMIH through December 31,\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net premiums written of $114.2 million compared to net premiums written of $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We had net premiums written for our primary mortgage insurance products of $109.3 million, $28.6 million, and $1.7 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The principal driver of the increase in primary premiums written in 2014 and 2015 was the continued growth of our policies in force and the significant development of our customer base. As of December 31, 2015, we had 63,948 primary certificates in force and 18,955 pool certificates in force, compared to 14,603 primary certificates in force and 20,573 pool certificates in force as of December 31, 2014.\nNet realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2015 were offset by an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) loss of $88.6 thousand due to a planned sales transaction that we expect will result in a loss in February 2016.\n \u2022 declines in housing values, as such declines may negatively affect loss mitigation opportunities on loans in default, as well as increase the likelihood that borrowers will default when the value of the home is below or perceived to be below the mortgage balance; \nWe intend to build a geographically diverse portfolio without significant geographic concentrations that might expose us to undue risk. We manage geographic concentration risk by establishing targets and limits for new origination mix and/or portfolio limits. If warranted, we would also establish restrictions in certain geographic markets; although, we currently do not have any geographic market restrictions in place. We expect that our insurance origination mix by region will be consistent with the overall distribution of mortgage originations in the U.S. that require mortgage insurance.\nIn November 2015, we entered into the Credit Agreement and obtained the Term Loan. Our long-term debt balance under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2015 was $143.9 million.\nThe table below shows primary NIW, IIF, RIF, policies in force, the weighted average coverage and loans in default, by quarter, for the last five quarters.\nConsistent with industry accounting practices, for purposes of establishing claim reserves, we adhere to the general claim reserving principles contained in ASC Topic 944, Financial Services - Insurance (ASC 944), even though that standard expressly excludes mortgage insurance from its guidance. Like other mortgage insurers, we will not establish claim reserves for anticipated future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default.\nAssets classified as Level 1 and Level 2\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, 100% of our pool RIF was comprised of insurance on fixed rate mortgages.\nReserve for Insurance Claims\nInsurance claims and claims expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of an increase in our NODs from December 31, 2014, in addition to our payment of two claims paid during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 the size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts tending to increase claims incurred; \nThe pre-tax book yield on our portfolio, excluding unrealized gains and losses, was 1.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The book yield is calculated on our year-to-date net investment income over our average portfolio book value at December 31, 2015. We believe that the yield on our investment portfolio likely will change over time based on potential changes to the interest rate environment, the duration or mix of our investment portfolio or other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2015, NMIC's primary RIF was approximately $3.6 billion representing insurance on a total of 63,948 policies in force, and pool RIF was approximately $93.1 million, representing insurance on a total of 18,955 loans. Based on NMIC's reported total statutory capital of $395 million at December 31, 2015, NMIC's RTC ratio was 8.4:1, significantly below the regulatory maximum RTC thresholds. Similarly, Re One had total statutory capital of $29 million at December 31, 2015, with a RTC ratio of 12.6:1. As of December 31, 2015, under PMIERs financial requirements, NMIC's minimum required assets were approximately $249.8 million and its available assets were approximately $431.4 million.\nWe began investing our cash during the first quarter of 2013 and continued to invest and re-balance our portfolio in the second and third quarters of 2013. As a result, our net investment income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Additionally, net investment income was higher for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of an increase in our consolidated securities portfolio, from $336.5 million at December 31, 2014 to $559.2 million at December 31, 2015. Net realized investment gains also increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the re-balancing of our portfolio among a mix of investment categories.\nInvestment Securities - Other-than-Temporary Impairment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net premiums written of $114.2 million and premiums earned of $45.5 million, compared to net premiums written of $34.0 million and premiums earned of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had net premiums written of $3.5 million and premiums earned of $2.1 million. Premiums written and earned in a year are generally influenced by:\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $617 million in cash and investments of which $100.2 million was held at NMIH. During 2015, NMIH received $148.5 million in proceeds, net of debt discount, from drawing down on the $150 million Term Loan. We contributed a substantial portion of the proceeds to our insurance subsidiaries, which they used to purchase securities to support growth in RIF and meet the final PMIERs requirements, effective December 31, 2015. We were cash flow positive from operating activities in 2015, however our cash decreased from year-end 2014 as a result of investment purchases.\n \u2022 Maintain approved status and relationships with National Accounts who purchase loans from Regional Accounts. Retaining these approvals as an authorized MI provider enables Regional Accounts to sell loans with insurance from us to those National Accounts through their correspondent channels. Consequently, these relationships are critical to continuing to grow our business with Regional Accounts. \nWe maintain cyber errors and omissions coverage to limit our exposure if an incident occurs. This insurance provides coverage for (i) claims related to, among other things, unauthorized network or computer access, unintentional disclosure or misuse of personally identifiable information in our possession, unintentional failure to disclose a breach and (ii) certain costs related to privacy notification, crisis management, cyber extortion, data recovery and business interruption.\nThe following tables show the distribution by state of our IIF and RIF, for both primary and pool insurance. As of December 31, 2015, our IIF and RIF continues to be relatively more concentrated in California, primarily as a result of the location and timing of the acquisition of new customers. With the broadening of our customer base, the concentration of primary IIF and RIF in California has declined from over 16.0% for both as of the end of 2014, to 13.8% and 12.9%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The distribution of risk across the states as of December 31, 2015 is not necessarily representative of the geographic distribution we expect in the future. As we add new customers and receive greater allocations of business from our existing customers, we expect we will have increased flexibility to manage our state concentration levels.\nCash flow provided from financing activities totaled $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the proceeds, net of debt discount, of $148.5 million from the Term Loan. The cash inflows from the Term Loan were partially offset by payments of debt issuance costs and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards.\nWe incurred interest expense of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the Term Loan entered into during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nRisk Free Interest Rate - is the U.S. Treasury rate for the date of the grant having a term approximating the expected life of the option.\nThe GSEs are the principal purchasers of mortgages insured by MI companies.

The only reinsurance agreements we currently have in place are between NMIC and Re One, and they are for the sole purpose of allowing NMIC to comply with certain statutory requirements regarding the amount of risk an MI company may retain on any single MI policy.  In our industry, a \"book\" is a group of loans that an MI company insures in a particular period, normally a calendar year. In general, the majority of any underwriting profit (i.e., the earned premium revenue minus claims and expenses, excluding investment income) that a book generates occurs in the early years of the book, with the largest portion of the underwriting profit for that book realized in the first year. This pattern generally occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years of the book, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments), and by increasing losses. The earnings we record and the cash flow we receive vary based on the type of MI product and premium plan our customers select.\nTo determine the fair value of securities available-for-sale in Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, independent pricing sources have been utilized. One price is provided per security based on observable market data. To ensure securities are appropriately classified in the fair value hierarchy, we review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing sources and believe that their policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the issue valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded. A variety of inputs are utilized by the independent pricing sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including data published in market research publications. Inputs may be weighted differently for any security, and not all inputs are used for each security evaluation. Market indicators, industry and economic events are also considered. This information is evaluated using a multidimensional pricing model. Quality controls are performed by the independent pricing sources throughout this process, which include reviewing tolerance reports, trading information and data changes, and directional moves compared to market moves. This model combines all inputs to arrive at a value assigned to each security. We have not made any adjustments to the prices obtained from the independent pricing sources; however, we do perform quality checks and review the prices received.\nIn February 2013, the Board approved a modification to the vesting terms of approximately 400,000 granted and non-vested RSUs held by our employees. The modification to the vesting terms removed the market condition leaving the RSUs subject to a service condition only. The modification resulted in a change in the period over which compensation costs are recognized and prospective recognition of incremental compensation cost. Incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified using relevant valuation inputs as of the modification date.\nThe tables below reflect our total primary IIF, RIF and average loan size, by FICO.\n \u2022 Top 10, primarily National Accounts, representing approximately 19% of the MI market; \n \u2022 change in rating below investment grade; and \nIn the second quarter of 2015, the FHFA published final updated PMIERs that went into effect on December 31, 2015 (Effective Date) for existing, GSE-approved private mortgage insurers, i.e., Approved Insurers.

Although we expect our year-over-year expenses to increase as we grow our business, we ultimately expect that the majority of our operating expenses will be relatively fixed in the long term. When our business is mature, we expect an expense ratio (expenses to premiums earned) to fall into the industry range of 20% to 25%. Until our business matures, our expense ratio is expected to be significantly higher than this range given the low levels of premium written compared to our \"fixed\" costs customary to operating a mortgage insurance company.\nConditions and Trends Impacting Our Business\nEach fiscal quarter we perform reviews of our investments in order to determine whether declines in fair value below amortized cost are considered other-than-temporary in accordance with applicable guidance. Under the current guidance, a debt security impairment is deemed other-than-temporary if either it is intended that the security be sold, or it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery or we do not expect to collect cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized\n*Long-term debt relates to our $150 million Credit Agreement and includes future interest payments using the minimum interest rate of 8.50%.\nA tax effected valuation allowance of $66.4 million and $53.7 million was recorded at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, to reflect the amount of the deferred taxes that may not be realized. As the Company has limited history, management has not yet concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income. If we conclude the taxable income will be sufficient to release the valuation allowance, we would recognize an income tax benefit associated primarily with the carry forward of federal net operating losses and future share-based compensation tax deductions.\n \u2022 Next 30, a combination of National and Regional Accounts, representing approximately 17% of the MI market; and ", "item_7_tables":
