In addition, you should read the Risk Factors\u201d and Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy. Our gene therapy product candidates are designed to deliver genes to cells to address genetic defects or to enable cells in the body to produce therapeutic proteins that are intended to impact disease. Through a single administration, our gene therapy product candidates are designed to provide long-lasting effects, potentially significantly altering the course of disease and delivering improved patient outcomes.\nOverview of Product Candidates\nWe have developed an internal pipeline of product candidates across the therapeutic areas of retinal, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.\nTable 314: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> RGX-314: Our lead product candidate RGX-314 is for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), a leading cause of total and partial vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan. We began enrollment in the Phase I/IIa clinical trial for RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD in May 2017 and have completed dosing of 30 total subjects in four cohorts, including six subjects in each of the first three cohorts and 12 subjects in the fourth cohort.

The investigational new drug (IND) application filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) for RGX-111 for the treatment of MPS I is active, we have submitted an application to the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) to proceed with a Phase I clinical trial evaluating RGX-111 for treatment of MPS I and we expect to begin enrollment in a Phase I clinical trial in mid-2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> RGX-501: We are developing RGX-501 for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a severe genetic disease characterized by premature and aggressive plaque buildup, life threatening coronary artery disease and aortic valve disease predominantly due to abnormalities in the function or expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Enrollment in the Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-501 began in March 2017. We have completed dosing of the first cohort of three subjects and have dosed three subjects in the second cohort, a total of six subjects. We have amended the clinical trial protocol and expect to enroll additional subjects using steroid prophylaxis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> RGX-181: We are developing RGX-181 for the treatment of late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, one of the most common forms of Batten disease, caused by mutations in the tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) gene. We plan to submit an IND application for RGX-181 for the treatment of CLN2 to the FDA in the second half of 2019 to enable initiation of a first-in-human clinical trial.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to our lead product candidates, we have also funded, and plan to continue to fund, preclinical research on potential product candidate programs that may become part of our internal product development pipeline. We have partnered with a number of leading academic institutions and will continue to seek partnerships with innovative institutions to develop novel NAV gene therapy product candidates.\nOverview of Our NAV Technology Platform\nIn addition to our internal product development efforts, we also selectively sublicense our proprietary adeno-associated virus gene therapy delivery platform (NAV Technology Platform) to other leading biotechnology companies, which we refer to as NAV Technology Licensees. As of December 31, 2018, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in the development of more than 20 partnered product candidates by our NAV Technology Licensees. Sublicensing allows us to maintain our internal product development focus on our core disease indications and therapeutic areas while still expanding the NAV gene therapy pipeline, developing a greater breadth of treatments for patients, providing additional technological and potential clinical proof-of-concept for our NAV Technology Platform, and creating potential additional revenue.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenues\nTo date, we have primarily generated revenues through the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform to NAV Technology Licensees. We have not generated any revenues from the sale of approved products. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner, or fail to obtain their regulatory approval, our ability to generate future revenues will be materially compromised.\nWe license our NAV Technology Platform to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. As of December 31, 2018, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in the development of more than 20 partnered product candidates by 11 NAV Technology Licensees. The terms of the licenses vary, and licenses may be exclusive or non-exclusive and may be sublicensable by the licensee. Licenses may grant intellectual property rights for purposes of internal and preclinical research and development only, or may include the rights, or options to obtain future rights, to commercialize drug therapies for specific diseases using the NAV Technology Platform. License agreements generally have a term at least equal to the life of the underlying patents, but are terminable at the option of the licensee. Consideration from licensees under our license agreements may include: (i) up-front and annual fees, (ii) option fees to acquire additional licenses, (iii) milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones by licensees, (iv) sublicense fees and (v) royalties on sales of licensed products. To date we have not recognized any revenue from the achievement of sales-based milestones or royalties on sales of licensed products.\nFuture license revenue is highly dependent on the successful development and commercialization of licensed products by our licensees, which is uncertain, and revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Additionally, we may never receive consideration in our license agreements that is contemplated on option fees, development and sales-based milestone payments, royalties on sales of licensed products or sublicense fees, given the contingent nature of these payments. Our license revenue is concentrated among a low number of licensees and licenses are terminable at the option of the licensee. The termination of our licenses by licensees may materially impact the amount of license revenue we recognize in future periods. Please refer to Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of segment and geographical information regarding our license revenue.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). We adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method and have applied the new standard to all of our license agreements in effect as of January 1, 2018. License revenue for periods ending after January 1, 2018 is presented in accordance with the requirements of Topic 606, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with Topic 605 and accordingly, may not be comparable.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist primarily of costs of revenue, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We allocate indirect expenses associated with our facilities, information technology costs, depreciation and other overhead costs between research and development and general and administrative categories based on employee headcount and the nature of work performed by each employee.\nCosts of Revenue\nCosts of revenue consist primarily of sublicense fees to licensors as a result of revenues generated from the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform. Sublicense fees are based on a percentage of license fees we receive from licensees as specified in the agreements with our licensors. We recognize sublicense fees in the period that the underlying license revenue is recognized. Future costs of revenue are uncertain due to the nature of our license agreements and significant fluctuations in costs of revenue may occur from period to period.\nResearch and Development Expense\nOur research and development expense primarily consists of:\nTable 319: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, stock-based compensation and travel, for our scientific personnel performing research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 320: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs related to executing preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 321: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs related to acquiring, developing and manufacturing materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 322: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees paid to consultants and other third-parties who support our product candidate development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 323: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> other costs in seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 324: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> allocated facility-related costs, depreciation expense and other overhead.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUp-front fees incurred in obtaining technology licenses for research and development activities are expensed as incurred if the technology licensed has no alternative future use.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue development of our product candidates. Our current and planned research and development activities include the following:\nTable 325: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a Phase I/IIa clinical trial and a planned Phase IIb clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-314 program for the treatment of wet AMD, and a planned Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-314 program for the treatment of an additional retinal condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 326: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-121 program for the treatment of MPS II;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 327: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-111 program for the treatment of MPS I;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 328: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-501 program for the treatment of HoFH;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 329: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> preclinical research and development for our RGX-181 program for the treatment of CLN2;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> preclinical research and development for additional product candidates addressing other diseases in the retinal, metabolic and neurodegenerative therapeutic areas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continued investment in advanced manufacturing analytics and process development activities;

We typically utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We do not allocate personnel and other internal costs, such as facilities and other overhead costs, to specific product candidates or development programs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee travel, benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes personnel in executive, commercial, corporate development, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and administrative support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related and overhead costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for accounting, legal and advisory services, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, insurance costs, costs of our information systems and other commercial and general corporate activities. We expect that our general and administrative expense will continue to increase as we continue to develop, and potentially commercialize, our product candidates.\nOther Income\nInterest Income from Licensing\nIn accordance with our revenue recognition policies described below and in Note 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements, interest income from licensing consists of imputed interest recognized from significant financing components identified in our license agreements with NAV Technology Licensees.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income consists of interest income earned and gains and losses realized from our cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market mutual funds and highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of 90 days or less at acquisition. Marketable securities are comprised of fixed income debt securities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies and recently announced accounting pronouncements, including the expected impact of such pronouncements, are fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). Topic 606 requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are performed to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligations.\nWe apply the five-step model to contracts that are within the scope of Topic 606 only when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, for contracts within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to respective performance obligations when (or as) the respective performance obligations are satisfied.\nWe evaluate our contracts for the presence of significant financing components. If a significant financing component is identified in a contract and provides a financing benefit to the customer, the transaction price for the contract is adjusted to account for the financing portion of the arrangement, which is recognized as interest income over the financing term using the effective interest method. In determining the appropriate interest rates for significant financing components, we evaluate the credit profile of the customer and prevailing market interest rates and select an interest rate in which we believe would be charged to the customer in a separate financing arrangement over a similar financing term.\nLicense revenue\nWe license our NAV Technology Platform to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The terms of the licenses vary, and licenses may be exclusive or non-exclusive and may be sublicensable by the licensee. Licenses may grant intellectual property rights for purposes of internal and preclinical research and development only, or may include the rights, or options to obtain future rights, to commercialize drug therapies for specific diseases using the NAV Technology Platform. License agreements generally have a term at least equal to the life of the underlying patents, but are terminable at the option of the licensee. Consideration payable to us under our license agreements may include: (i) up-front and annual fees, (ii) option fees to acquire additional licenses, (iii) milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones by licensees, (iv) sublicense fees and (v) royalties on sales of licensed products.\nOur license agreements are accounted for as contracts with customers within the scope of Topic 606. At the inception of each license agreement, we determine the contract term for purposes of applying the requirements of Topic 606. Licenses are generally terminable at the option of the licensee with advance notice. For each license, we evaluate these termination rights to determine whether a substantive termination penalty would be incurred by the licensee upon termination. If the licensee incurs a substantive termination penalty upon termination, the contract term for revenue recognition purposes is generally equal to the stated term of the license, which is the life of the underlying licensed patents. Alternatively, if the licensee does not incur a substantive termination penalty upon termination, the contract term for revenue recognition purposes may be shorter than the stated term of the license, in which case the termination rights may be accounted for as contract renewal options. The determination of whether a substantive termination penalty is associated with the termination rights requires significant judgment. In making this determination, we consider, among other things, the nature of the intellectual property rights that would be returned to us upon termination, including the exclusivity of the licensed rights and the stage of development of the licensed products, the payment terms, including the amount and timing of non-refundable or guaranteed payments, and the business purpose of the termination rights granted to the licensee. We consider all of the facts and circumstances relevant to each license when making this determination.\nPerformance obligations under our license agreements may include (i) the delivery of intellectual property licenses and (ii) options granted to licensees to acquire additional licenses to the extent the options represent material rights to the licensee. At the inception of each license agreement which contains options for the licensee to acquire additional licenses, or contract renewal options, we evaluate the options to determine whether they provide material rights to the licensee. In making this determination, we consider whether the options are priced at a discount to the standalone selling price for the underlying licenses. If an option is priced at a discount to the standalone selling price for the underlying license, the option is considered to be a material right to the licensee and is accounted for as a separate performance obligation under the current license agreement.\nWe evaluate the transaction price of our license agreements at the inception of each agreement and at each reporting date. The transaction price includes the fixed consideration payable to us during the contract term, as well as any variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur in the future. Fixed consideration under the license agreements includes up-front and annual fees payable during the contract term. Variable consideration under the license agreements includes development and sales-based milestone payments, sublicense fees and royalties on sales of licensed products. Consideration contingent upon the exercise of options by a licensee is excluded from the transaction price and not accounted for as part of the license agreement until the option is exercised.\nThe transaction price for each license agreement is allocated to the underlying performance obligations and recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. Consideration allocated to performance obligations for the delivery of an intellectual property license is recognized as revenue in full upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. Consideration allocated to performance obligations for license options is recognized as revenue in full upon the earlier of the option exercise or expiration. The exercise of a license option by a licensee is accounted for as a new license for revenue recognition purposes.\nUp-front and annual licenses fees payable to us over the contract term of each license are included in the transaction price, and the portion of this consideration that is allocated to the performance obligation for the delivery of the intellectual property license is recognized as revenue in full upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. If annual license fees are payable to us in periods beyond 12 months from the delivery of the license, a significant financing component is deemed to exist which provides a financing benefit to the licensee. If a significant financing component is identified, we adjust the transaction price for the license to include only the present value of the annual license fees payable to us over the contract term. The discounted portion of the license fees is recognized as interest income from licensing in the consolidated statements of operations over the financing period of the license.\nDevelopment milestone payments are payable to us upon the achievement of specified development milestones by licensees. At the inception of each license agreement that contains development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of achievement and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in the future, milestone payments are included in the transaction price and recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the license. Milestone payments contingent on the achievement of development milestones that are not within our control or the control of the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved and are excluded from the transaction price until the milestone is achieved. At each reporting date, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of outstanding development milestones and, if necessary, adjust the transaction price for any milestones for which the probability of achievement has changed due to current facts and circumstances. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis and recognized as revenue in the period of the adjustment.\nRoyalties on sales of licensed products, sales-based milestone payments and sublicense fees based on the receipt of certain fees by licensees from any sublicensees are excluded from the transaction price of each license and recognized as revenue in the period that the related sales or sublicenses occur, provided that the associated license has been delivered to the licensee. To date we have not recognized any revenue from royalties on sales of licensed products or the achievement of sales-based milestones.\nWe receive payments from licensees based on the billing schedules established in each license agreement. Amounts recognized as revenue which have not yet been received from licensees are recorded as accounts receivable when our rights to the consideration are conditional solely upon the passage of time. Amounts recognized as revenue which have not yet been received from licensees are recorded as contract assets when our rights to the consideration are not unconditional. Contract assets are recorded as other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. If a licensee elects to terminate a license prior to the end of the license term, the licensed intellectual property is returned to us and any consideration recorded as accounts receivable or contract assets which is not contractually payable by the licensee is charged off as a reduction of license revenue in the period of the termination. Amounts received from licensees prior to the delivery of underlying performance obligations are deferred and recognized as revenue upon the satisfaction of the performance obligations. Deferred revenue which is not expected to be recognized within 12 months from the reporting date is recorded as non-current on the consolidated balance sheets.\nImpact of Adoption of Topic 606\nWe recorded a net reduction in opening accumulated deficit of $4.8 million as of January 1, 2018 for the cumulative impact of adoption of Topic 606, which was primarily the result of accelerated recognition of license revenue related to annual license fees under Topic 606. Under Topic 605, annual license fees payable to us by licensees were recognized as license revenue annually when the amounts became fixed or determinable. Under Topic 606, the present value of aggregate annual license fees over the contract term of the license agreement are recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. The impact of the accelerated recognition of license revenue upon adoption was partially offset by the accelerated recognition of licensing costs to our licensors. We recognize sublicense fees to our licensors in the period the underlying license revenue is recognized.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nWe estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders with service providers, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed, the expected remaining period of performance and the associated expenses incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. Depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the estimated expenses incurred, we may record net prepaid or accrued research and development expenses relating to these costs.\nExamples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> contract research organizations in connection with preclinical development and clinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> contract manufacturing organizations and other vendors related to process development and manufacturing of materials for use in preclinical development and clinical studies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 336: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> service providers for professional service fees such as consulting and other research and development related services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing may vary and may result in us reporting changes in estimates in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nStock-based Compensation\nOur stock-based awards include stock options granted to employees and nonemployees, restricted stock units and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan.\nOur stock-based awards are subject to either service or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployees with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the estimated grant date fair value over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployees with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the estimated grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable.\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Stock-based Awards\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including (i) the fair value of the underlying common stock, (ii) the expected stock price volatility, (iii) the expected term of the award, (iv) the risk-free interest rate and (v) expected dividends. In applying these assumptions, we consider the following factors:\nTable 337: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The fair value of our common stock used to determine the exercise price and fair value of our stock options is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our common stock has only been publicly traded since September 2015 and, accordingly, we do not have sufficient historical and implied volatility data for our common stock necessary to estimate the expected the volatility of our common stock over a period of time commensurate with the expected term of our stock option awards. As a result, we estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of both our common stock and the common stock of a selected peer group of similar publicly traded companies for which sufficient historical volatility data is available. Due to the lack of historical volatility data for our common stock, we place a higher weight on the historical volatility of the selected peer group in estimating expected volatility. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> prices for the selected companies' shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option awards. For the purpose of identifying the selected peer group companies, we consider characteristics such as enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry and length of historical share price information. We focus our peer group company selection on companies that operate within the biotechnology industry, and specifically on companies that use gene therapy, or similar technologies, for treating diseases and/or are focused on treating diseases in our development pipeline or our licensees' pipelines. We plan to continue using historical peer group volatility data as an input to estimate expected volatility until a sufficient amount of historical volatility data for our common stock becomes available.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We estimate the expected term of plain vanilla\u201d stock options granted to employees based on the simplified method in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 107 and 110, as our common stock has only been publicly traded since September 2015. Using the simplified method, the expected term of the award equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. We expect to use the simplified method to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees until we have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. For stock options granted to nonemployees, we use the contractual term of the award rather than the expected term to estimate the fair value of the award.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We estimate the risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of our stock options based on the rates of U.S. Treasury securities with maturity dates commensurate with the expected term of the associated awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The assumed dividend yield is zero is based on our history of not paying dividends and expectation of not paying dividends for the foreseeable future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe estimate the fair value of our restricted stock units based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant.\nOn July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-based Payment Accounting. Prior to the adoption of this standard, compensation expense for our stock-based awards to nonemployees was based on the then-current fair value of the awards at each reporting date prior to the measurement date, which is generally the vesting date. Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-07, these awards will no longer be remeasured and any new stock-based awards granted to nonemployees after the adoption of the new standard will be measured at the estimated grant date fair value of the awards.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $56.1 million, U.S. state NOL carryforwards of $56.2 million and federal research and development credit carryforwards of $29.1 million which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2038.\nUnder the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. We have completed several financings since our inception which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or could result in a change in control in the future.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including our NOL and credit carryforwards. Based on our history of operating losses, we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA) was signed into law in December 2017 and, among other changes, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, elimination, reduction or limitation of certain domestic deductions and credits, limitation of the deduction for NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income, elimination of NOL carrybacks, one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain significant exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits, including the orphan drug tax credit. Most of the changes resulting from the TCJA were effective beginning in 2018.\nIn December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which allowed us to record provisional amounts for the effects of the TCJA in the period it was enacted for a measurement period not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. Under SAB 118, we recorded a provisional reduction in our deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowance of $17.9 million in 2017 for the effects of the TCJA, which was primarily attributable to the reduction in federal tax rates. We have completed our assessment of the final impact of the TCJA within the required measurement period under SAB 118 and determined that there were no material adjustments to the provisional amounts previously recorded.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to our financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which supersedes ASC 840, Leases (Topic 840) and provides principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. We will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition method and will apply Topic 842 to leases in effect as of, or entered into after, the adoption date. The cumulative impact of adoption will be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit on January 1, 2019 and prior periods will not be adjusted. This adoption approach will result in a consolidated balance sheet that may not be comparable to prior periods in the first year of adoption. Upon adoption, we expect to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to our operating leases for office and laboratory facilities and equipment. The right-of-use assets and related liabilities may be material. Additionally, upon adoption, we expect to derecognize $5.9 million of property and equipment and $5.9 million of financing lease obligations related to construction-in-progress at 9800 Medical Center Drive, as we do not control the building during the construction period under the requirements of Topic 842. We do not expect the adoption of Topic 842 to have a material impact on our results of operations. Please refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our adoption of Topic 842.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 218,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 208,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 218,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 208,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licensing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,885\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 163,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income from licensing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73,169\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 177,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Tax Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,179\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,179\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (73,169\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 173,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicense Revenue. License revenue increased by $208.1 million, from $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $218.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the following license revenue recognized during 2018:\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $176.1 million of revenue recognized under our March 2014 license agreement, as amended in January 2018, with AveXis, Inc.

In January 2019, Novartis AG (Novartis), which acquired AveXis in May 2018, announced that it expects to launch ZOLGENSMA\u00ae in 2019, pending approval by regulatory authorities. If approved, ZOLGENSMA will be the first approved product under our amended March 2014 license agreement with AveXis. Upon its approval and launch, we will begin recognizing royalty revenue on net sales of ZOLGENSMA.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expenses increased by $26.6 million, from $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nTable 346: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase of $10.9 million for personnel costs as a result of increased headcount of research and development personnel, including a $2.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase of $6.1 million for laboratory costs and facilities and equipment used by research and development personnel, including a $1.3 million increase in depreciation expense allocated to research and development functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase of $4.5 million for external costs associated with clinical trial activities for our lead product candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase of $3.5 million for externally sourced manufacturing-related and process development services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expense.

Interest income from licensing increased by $8.9 million, from zero for the year ended December 31, 2017. In January 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition standards under Topic 606, the requirements of which have not been retrospectively applied to prior periods. Under Topic 606, we impute and recognize interest income related to significant financing components identified in our license agreements with NAV Technology Licensees. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $8.0 million of interest income under our amended March 2014 license agreement with AveXis and $0.4 million of interest income under our November 2018 license agreement with Abeona.\nInvestment Income. Investment income increased by $4.4 million, from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our investment portfolio in 2018, which was largely driven by cash inflows from our licensing arrangements as well as the net proceeds received from the public offering of our common stock completed in August 2018.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nTable 352: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (278\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licensing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (92\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses (income)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,885\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (65,340\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,545\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73,169\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63,402\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,767\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Tax Benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (435\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (73,169\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (62,967\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,202\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicense Revenue. License revenue increased by $6.1 million, from $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $6.0 million of revenue recognized under our June 2017 license agreement with AveXis for the development and commercialization of treatments for Rett Syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in the gene that produces the copper zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1).\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expenses increased by $11.7 million, from $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nTable 353: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase of $10.2 million for personnel costs as a result of increased headcount of research and development personnel, including a $2.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 354: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase of $2.5 million for laboratory costs and externally sourced manufacturing-related and process development services; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 355: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase of $2.3 million for facilities and equipment used by research and development personnel, including a $1.9 million increase in depreciation expense allocated to research and development functions, primarily as a result of our advanced manufacturing and analytics laboratory which opened in early 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 million for externally sourced preclinical research and development services related to our lead product candidates and the advancement of our technology and other potential product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense.

Additionally, we have supplemented our cash flows with fees received from granting commercial licenses to our proprietary technology to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at the least the next 12 months from the date of this report, based on our current business plan.\nIn March 2017, we completed a public offering of 3,700,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.50 per share. In connection with the offering, we granted the underwriters an option to purchase 555,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price. The underwriters exercised the option in full and purchased the additional shares in April 2017. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering, inclusive of the underwriters' option exercise, were $81.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\nIn August 2018, we completed a public offering of 3,105,000 shares of our common stock (inclusive of 405,000 shares pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) at a price of $65.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering, inclusive of the underwriters' option exercise, were $189.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\nIn January 2018, we amended our March 2014 license agreement (the January 2018 Amendment) with AveXis which modified its terms and conditions and provided additional intellectual property rights to AveXis. In consideration for the additional rights granted under the amended license agreement, AveXis paid us $80.0 million upon the effective date of the amendment. In addition, AveXis was obligated to pay us (i) $30.0 million on the first anniversary of the effective date of the January 2018 Amendment, (ii) $30.0 million on the second anniversary of the effective date of the January 2018 Amendment and (iii) potential sales-based milestone payments of up to $120.0 million. In the event of a change of control of AveXis, to the extent that any fee described in (i) or (ii) above, or the first $40.0 million of milestone payments described in (iii) above, had not yet been paid to us, AveXis was obligated to pay any such unpaid fee to us upon the change of control. In May 2018, AveXis was acquired by Novartis. AveXis paid us $100.0 million in accelerated license payments following the change of control. Pursuant to the amended license agreement, AveXis is obligated to pay us $80.0 million upon the achievement of a sales-based milestone, in addition to other regulatory milestone payments and royalties on net sales of licensed products. In January 2019, Novartis announced that it expects to launch ZOLGENSMA in 2019, pending approval by regulatory authorities. If approved, ZOLGENSMA which will be the first approved product under the amended March 2014 license agreement.\nWe have incurred cumulative losses since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of $83.0 million as of December 31, 2018. Our transition to recurring profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We do not expect to achieve such revenues, and expect to continue to incur losses, for at least the next several years. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we expect our capital expenditures will increase significantly in the future for costs associated with building out additional office, laboratory and manufacturing capacity. As a result, we will need significant additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain through one or more equity offerings, debt financings or other third-party funding, including potential strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements.\nCash Flows\nTable 358: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (57,992\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (48,558\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used) in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (279,358\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,790\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (29,051\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $162.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $180.0 million in license payments received in 2018 related to the amendment of our March 2014 license agreement with AveXis, and was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses during the period. Net cash used in operating activities increased by $9.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses during the period. The increases in operating expenses during the periods were primarily attributable to increased employee headcount and increases in external research and development expenses as we continue the development and advancement of our lead product candidates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash provided by operating activities of $104.6 million consisted of net income of $99.9 million and $12.5 million in adjustments for non-cash items, offset by changes in working capital of $7.8 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expenses of $16.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $4.0 million and net amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities of $0.8 million and were partially offset by imputed interest earned from our license agreements of $8.9 million. The change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable of $16.8 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.5 million and an increase in other assets of $1.5 million, and was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $7.6 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $3.9 million and an increased in other liabilities of $1.7 million. The increase in accounts receivable is largely driven by $26.0 million of accounts receivable recorded as of December 31, 2018 related to the November 2018 license with Abeona, and was partially offset by the imputed interest recognized upon the acceleration of license payments under our amended license agreement with AveXis. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities is largely driven by increases in accrued personnel costs, accrued external research and development expenses and accrued licensing costs as of December 31, 2018. The increase in deferred revenue is largely driven by consideration received from licensees during the period for license options which represent unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash used in operating activities of $58.0 million consisted of a net loss of $73.2 million, offset by $14.3 million in adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital of $0.9 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expenses of $10.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 million and net amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities of $1.8 million. The change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.5 million, and was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses of $3.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash used in operating activities of $48.6 million consisted of a net loss of $63.0 million, offset by $9.2 million in adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital of $5.2 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expenses of $7.0 million and net amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities of $2.0 million. The change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.1 million, an increase in deferred rent of $1.3 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.1 million, and was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.9 million.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $445.8 million to purchase marketable securities and $13.3 million to purchase property and equipment, offset by $179.7 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $68.6 million to purchase marketable securities and $7.2 million to purchase property and equipment, offset by $71.0 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities consisted of $72.6 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $45.1 million to purchase marketable securities and $8.1 million to purchase property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $189.1 million in aggregate net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and additional offering expenses we paid during the period, and $15.3 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $81.5 million in aggregate net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and additional offering expenses we paid during the period, and $3.0 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $0.2 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nTo date, we have primarily generated revenue through license agreements with strategic partners for research, development and commercialization of product candidates using our proprietary technology. We do not expect to generate significant recurring revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue to expand the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.\nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this report, based on our current business plan. We intend to devote the majority of our current capital to clinical development and seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of gene therapy product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amount of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. Additionally, our estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 359: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing of enrollment, commencement and completion of our clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 360: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the results of our clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 361: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the results of our preclinical studies for our product candidates and any subsequent clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 362: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our planned expansion of the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 363: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, laboratory testing, preclinical development and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 364: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs associated with building out additional laboratory and manufacturing capacity, if any;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 365: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 366: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of future product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution activities for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 367: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 368: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 369: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our current licensing agreements or collaborations remaining in effect;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 370: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain additional licensing agreements or collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 371: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMany of these factors are outside of our control. Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory and marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our product revenues, if any, and any commercial milestones or royalty payments under our licensing agreements, will be derived from or based on sales of products that may not be commercially available for many years, if at all. In addition, revenue from our NAV Technology Platform sublicensing is dependent in part on the clinical and commercial success of our licensing partners. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.\nThe issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our intellectual property, our product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nOur principal commitments include obligations under vendor contracts to provide research services and other purchase commitments with our vendors. In the normal course of business, we enter into services agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and other third-parties. Generally, these agreements provide for termination upon notice, with specified amounts due upon termination based on the timing of termination and the terms of the agreement. The actual amounts and timing of payments under these agreements are uncertain and contingent upon the initiation and completion of the services to be provided. These amounts are not fixed and determinable and therefore are not included in the table below.\nOur commitments include obligations to our licensors under our in-license agreements, which may include sublicense fees, milestones fees, royalties and reimbursement of patent maintenance costs. Sublicense fees are due to the licensors when we sublicense underlying intellectual property to third-parties; the fees are based on a percentage of the license fees we receive from the sublicensees. Based on license fees we have received from sublicensees or recorded as accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018, we have accrued $4.1 million of sublicense fees payable to our licensors, of which $1.6 million is expected to be paid in 2019 and $2.5 million is expected to be paid in periods beyond 2019. The actual amount of sublicense fees payable in future periods could differ materially if new licenses are granted to sublicensees, existing licenses are terminated by sublicensees or if certain other contingent consideration, such as milestone payments, is received from sublicensees in the future. Accordingly, the amount of sublicense fees payable in future periods is not fixed and determinable and therefore is not included in the table below. Milestone fees are payable by us upon our future achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Royalty fees are based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products. Maintenance costs are reimbursements to the licensors for maintaining licensed patents. These amounts are not fixed and determinable and therefore are not included in the table below.\nWe have entered into a number of long-term leases for office and laboratory space in Rockville, Maryland and New York, New York, as well as a number of laboratory and other equipment leases. The table below includes the future minimum lease payments under our lease agreements.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, excluding the items discussed above:\nTable 372: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future minimum lease payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nTable 373: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": " \u2022 our current licensing agreements or collaborations remaining in effect; \nExpenses incurred in the development of RGX-181 were included in unallocated external expenses through the second quarter of 2018.

We will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition method and will apply Topic 842 to leases in effect as of, or entered into after, the adoption date. The cumulative impact of adoption will be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit on January 1, 2019 and prior periods will not be adjusted. This adoption approach will result in a consolidated balance sheet that may not be comparable to prior periods in the first year of adoption. Upon adoption, we expect to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to our operating leases for office and laboratory facilities and equipment. The right-of-use assets and related liabilities may be material. Additionally, upon adoption, we expect to derecognize $5.9 million of property and equipment and $5.9 million of financing lease obligations related to construction-in-progress at 9800 Medical Center Drive, as we do not control the building during the construction period under the requirements of Topic 842. We do not expect the adoption of Topic 842 to have a material impact on our results of operations. Please refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our adoption of Topic 842.\nResults of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOther Income\nIn March 2017, we completed a public offering of 3,700,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.50 per share. In connection with the offering, we granted the underwriters an option to purchase 555,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price. The underwriters exercised the option in full and purchased the additional shares in April 2017. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering, inclusive of the underwriters' option exercise, were $81.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\nTable 352: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (278\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licensing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (92\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses (income)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,885\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (65,340\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,545\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73,169\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63,402\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,767\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Tax Benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (435\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (73,169\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (62,967\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,202\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 service providers for professional service fees such as consulting and other research and development related services. \nOur understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing may vary and may result in us reporting changes in estimates in any particular period.

In January 2019, Novartis AG (Novartis), which acquired AveXis in May 2018, announced that it expects to launch ZOLGENSMA\u00ae in 2019, pending approval by regulatory authorities. If approved, ZOLGENSMA will be the first approved product under our amended March 2014 license agreement with AveXis. Upon its approval and launch, we will begin recognizing royalty revenue on net sales of ZOLGENSMA.\nTable 358: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (57,992\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (48,558\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used) in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (279,358\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,790\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (29,051\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nTable 333: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RGX-314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RGX-121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RGX-111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RGX-501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RGX-181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total direct expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel-related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities and depreciation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment income consists of interest income earned and gains and losses realized from our cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market mutual funds and highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of 90 days or less at acquisition. Marketable securities are comprised of fixed income debt securities.\n \u2022 fees paid to consultants and other third-parties who support our product candidate development; \n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain additional licensing agreements or collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and \n \u2022 the results of our preclinical studies for our product candidates and any subsequent clinical trials; \nCosts of revenue consist primarily of sublicense fees to licensors as a result of revenues generated from the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform. Sublicense fees are based on a percentage of license fees we receive from licensees as specified in the agreements with our licensors. We recognize sublicense fees in the period that the underlying license revenue is recognized. Future costs of revenue are uncertain due to the nature of our license agreements and significant fluctuations in costs of revenue may occur from period to period.\nResearch and Development Expense\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $470.6 million, which were primarily derived from the sale of common stock, as described below. Additionally, we have supplemented our cash flows with fees received from granting commercial licenses to our proprietary technology to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at the least the next 12 months from the date of this report, based on our current business plan.\n \u2022 the costs associated with building out additional laboratory and manufacturing capacity, if any; \nWe evaluate our contracts for the presence of significant financing components. If a significant financing component is identified in a contract and provides a financing benefit to the customer, the transaction price for the contract is adjusted to account for the financing portion of the arrangement, which is recognized as interest income over the financing term using the effective interest method. In determining the appropriate interest rates for significant financing components, we evaluate the credit profile of the customer and prevailing market interest rates and select an interest rate in which we believe would be charged to the customer in a separate financing arrangement over a similar financing term.\nOur principal commitments include obligations under vendor contracts to provide research services and other purchase commitments with our vendors. In the normal course of business, we enter into services agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and other third-parties. Generally, these agreements provide for termination upon notice, with specified amounts due upon termination based on the timing of termination and the terms of the agreement. The actual amounts and timing of payments under these agreements are uncertain and contingent upon the initiation and completion of the services to be provided. These amounts are not fixed and determinable and therefore are not included in the table below.\n \u2022 We estimate the expected term of plain vanilla\u201d stock options granted to employees based on the simplified method in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 107 and 110, as our common stock has only been publicly traded since September 2015. Using the simplified method, the expected term of the award equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. We expect to use the simplified method to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees until we have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. For stock options granted to nonemployees, we use the contractual term of the award rather than the expected term to estimate the fair value of the award. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities consisted of $72.6 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $45.1 million to purchase marketable securities and $8.1 million to purchase property and equipment.\n \u2022 $35.6 million of revenue recognized under our November 2018 license agreement with Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Abeona) for the development and commercialization of treatments for various diseases. \nMany of these factors are outside of our control. Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory and marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our product revenues, if any, and any commercial milestones or royalty payments under our licensing agreements, will be derived from or based on sales of products that may not be commercially available for many years, if at all. In addition, revenue from our NAV Technology Platform sublicensing is dependent in part on the clinical and commercial success of our licensing partners. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $189.1 million in aggregate net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and additional offering expenses we paid during the period, and $15.3 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $56.1 million, U.S. state NOL carryforwards of $56.2 million and federal research and development credit carryforwards of $29.1 million which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2038.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $0.2 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.\nWe have developed an internal pipeline of product candidates across the therapeutic areas of retinal, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.\nStock-based Compensation\n \u2022 an increase of $2.5 million for laboratory costs and externally sourced manufacturing-related and process development services; and \nThe transaction price for each license agreement is allocated to the underlying performance obligations and recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. Consideration allocated to performance obligations for the delivery of an intellectual property license is recognized as revenue in full upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. Consideration allocated to performance obligations for license options is recognized as revenue in full upon the earlier of the option exercise or expiration. The exercise of a license option by a licensee is accounted for as a new license for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe evaluate the transaction price of our license agreements at the inception of each agreement and at each reporting date. The transaction price includes the fixed consideration payable to us during the contract term, as well as any variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur in the future. Fixed consideration under the license agreements includes up-front and annual fees payable during the contract term. Variable consideration under the license agreements includes development and sales-based milestone payments, sublicense fees and royalties on sales of licensed products. Consideration contingent upon the exercise of options by a licensee is excluded from the transaction price and not accounted for as part of the license agreement until the option is exercised.\nImpact of Adoption of Topic 606\nOur significant accounting policies and recently announced accounting pronouncements, including the expected impact of such pronouncements, are fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee travel, benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes personnel in executive, commercial, corporate development, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and administrative support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related and overhead costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for accounting, legal and advisory services, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, insurance costs, costs of our information systems and other commercial and general corporate activities. We expect that our general and administrative expense will continue to increase as we continue to develop, and potentially commercialize, our product candidates.\n \u2022 a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-501 program for the treatment of HoFH; \n \u2022 a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-121 program for the treatment of MPS II; \nWe recorded a net reduction in opening accumulated deficit of $4.8 million as of January 1, 2018 for the cumulative impact of adoption of Topic 606, which was primarily the result of accelerated recognition of license revenue related to annual license fees under Topic 606. Under Topic 605, annual license fees payable to us by licensees were recognized as license revenue annually when the amounts became fixed or determinable. Under Topic 606, the present value of aggregate annual license fees over the contract term of the license agreement are recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. The impact of the accelerated recognition of license revenue upon adoption was partially offset by the accelerated recognition of licensing costs to our licensors. We recognize sublicense fees to our licensors in the period the underlying license revenue is recognized.\nWe estimate the fair value of our restricted stock units based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant.\n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, laboratory testing, preclinical development and clinical trials for our product candidates; \nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur commitments include obligations to our licensors under our in-license agreements, which may include sublicense fees, milestones fees, royalties and reimbursement of patent maintenance costs. Sublicense fees are due to the licensors when we sublicense underlying intellectual property to third-parties; the fees are based on a percentage of the license fees we receive from the sublicensees. Based on license fees we have received from sublicensees or recorded as accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018, we have accrued $4.1 million of sublicense fees payable to our licensors, of which $1.6 million is expected to be paid in 2019 and $2.5 million is expected to be paid in periods beyond 2019. The actual amount of sublicense fees payable in future periods could differ materially if new licenses are granted to sublicensees, existing licenses are terminated by sublicensees or if certain other contingent consideration, such as milestone payments, is received from sublicensees in the future. Accordingly, the amount of sublicense fees payable in future periods is not fixed and determinable and therefore is not included in the table below. Milestone fees are payable by us upon our future achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Royalty fees are based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products. Maintenance costs are reimbursements to the licensors for maintaining licensed patents. These amounts are not fixed and determinable and therefore are not included in the table below.\nOverview\nWe have incurred cumulative losses since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of $83.0 million as of December 31, 2018. Our transition to recurring profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We do not expect to achieve such revenues, and expect to continue to incur losses, for at least the next several years. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we expect our capital expenditures will increase significantly in the future for costs associated with building out additional office, laboratory and manufacturing capacity. As a result, we will need significant additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain through one or more equity offerings, debt financings or other third-party funding, including potential strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA) was signed into law in December 2017 and, among other changes, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, elimination, reduction or limitation of certain domestic deductions and credits, limitation of the deduction for NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income, elimination of NOL carrybacks, one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain significant exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits, including the orphan drug tax credit. Most of the changes resulting from the TCJA were effective beginning in 2018.\nInterest Income from Licensing. Interest income from licensing increased by $8.9 million, from zero for the year ended December 31, 2017. In January 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition standards under Topic 606, the requirements of which have not been retrospectively applied to prior periods. Under Topic 606, we impute and recognize interest income related to significant financing components identified in our license agreements with NAV Technology Licensees. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $8.0 million of interest income under our amended March 2014 license agreement with AveXis and $0.4 million of interest income under our November 2018 license agreement with Abeona.\n \u2022 contract manufacturing organizations and other vendors related to process development and manufacturing of materials for use in preclinical development and clinical studies; and \nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, you should read the Risk Factors\u201d and Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). We adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method and have applied the new standard to all of our license agreements in effect as of January 1, 2018. License revenue for periods ending after January 1, 2018 is presented in accordance with the requirements of Topic 606, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with Topic 605 and accordingly, may not be comparable.\nOverview of Our NAV Technology Platform\nInvestment Income\nUnder the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. We have completed several financings since our inception which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or could result in a change in control in the future.\n \u2022 an increase of $10.2 million for personnel costs as a result of increased headcount of research and development personnel, including a $2.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 preclinical research and development for our RGX-181 program for the treatment of CLN2; \nPerformance obligations under our license agreements may include (i) the delivery of intellectual property licenses and (ii) options granted to licensees to acquire additional licenses to the extent the options represent material rights to the licensee. At the inception of each license agreement which contains options for the licensee to acquire additional licenses, or contract renewal options, we evaluate the options to determine whether they provide material rights to the licensee. In making this determination, we consider whether the options are priced at a discount to the standalone selling price for the underlying licenses. If an option is priced at a discount to the standalone selling price for the underlying license, the option is considered to be a material right to the licensee and is accounted for as a separate performance obligation under the current license agreement.\nLicense Revenue. License revenue increased by $208.1 million, from $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $218.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the following license revenue recognized during 2018:\nWe license our NAV Technology Platform to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The terms of the licenses vary, and licenses may be exclusive or non-exclusive and may be sublicensable by the licensee. Licenses may grant intellectual property rights for purposes of internal and preclinical research and development only, or may include the rights, or options to obtain future rights, to commercialize drug therapies for specific diseases using the NAV Technology Platform. License agreements generally have a term at least equal to the life of the underlying patents, but are terminable at the option of the licensee. Consideration payable to us under our license agreements may include: (i) up-front and annual fees, (ii) option fees to acquire additional licenses, (iii) milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones by licensees, (iv) sublicense fees and (v) royalties on sales of licensed products.\nCosts of Revenue\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). Topic 606 requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are performed to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligations.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash provided by operating activities of $104.6 million consisted of net income of $99.9 million and $12.5 million in adjustments for non-cash items, offset by changes in working capital of $7.8 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expenses of $16.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $4.0 million and net amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities of $0.8 million and were partially offset by imputed interest earned from our license agreements of $8.9 million. The change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable of $16.8 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.5 million and an increase in other assets of $1.5 million, and was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $7.6 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $3.9 million and an increased in other liabilities of $1.7 million. The increase in accounts receivable is largely driven by $26.0 million of accounts receivable recorded as of December 31, 2018 related to the November 2018 license with Abeona, and was partially offset by the imputed interest recognized upon the acceleration of license payments under our amended license agreement with AveXis. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities is largely driven by increases in accrued personnel costs, accrued external research and development expenses and accrued licensing costs as of December 31, 2018. The increase in deferred revenue is largely driven by consideration received from licensees during the period for license options which represent unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nOn July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-based Payment Accounting. Prior to the adoption of this standard, compensation expense for our stock-based awards to nonemployees was based on the then-current fair value of the awards at each reporting date prior to the measurement date, which is generally the vesting date. Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-07, these awards will no longer be remeasured and any new stock-based awards granted to nonemployees after the adoption of the new standard will be measured at the estimated grant date fair value of the awards.\nTo date, we have primarily generated revenues through the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform to NAV Technology Licensees. We have not generated any revenues from the sale of approved products. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner, or fail to obtain their regulatory approval, our ability to generate future revenues will be materially compromised.\n</td> </tr>\nRoyalties on sales of licensed products, sales-based milestone payments and sublicense fees based on the receipt of certain fees by licensees from any sublicensees are excluded from the transaction price of each license and recognized as revenue in the period that the related sales or sublicenses occur, provided that the associated license has been delivered to the licensee. To date we have not recognized any revenue from royalties on sales of licensed products or the achievement of sales-based milestones.\nInvesting Activities\n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $81.5 million in aggregate net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and additional offering expenses we paid during the period, and $3.0 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nWe apply the five-step model to contracts that are within the scope of Topic 606 only when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, for contracts within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to respective performance obligations when (or as) the respective performance obligations are satisfied.\n \u2022 an increase of $3.5 million for externally sourced manufacturing-related and process development services. \n \u2022 an increase of $2.3 million for facilities and equipment used by research and development personnel, including a $1.9 million increase in depreciation expense allocated to research and development functions, primarily as a result of our advanced manufacturing and analytics laboratory which opened in early 2017. \n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur stock-based awards include stock options granted to employees and nonemployees, restricted stock units and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expenses increased by $26.6 million, from $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nUp-front fees incurred in obtaining technology licenses for research and development activities are expensed as incurred if the technology licensed has no alternative future use.\nWe are a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy. Our gene therapy product candidates are designed to deliver genes to cells to address genetic defects or to enable cells in the body to produce therapeutic proteins that are intended to impact disease. Through a single administration, our gene therapy product candidates are designed to provide long-lasting effects, potentially significantly altering the course of disease and delivering improved patient outcomes.\nThe increase in license revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 also resulted in a $7.9 million increase in licensing costs incurred during the period related to the sublicense fees we are obligated to pay to our licensors.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\n \u2022 preclinical research and development for additional product candidates addressing other diseases in the retinal, metabolic and neurodegenerative therapeutic areas; \nIn accordance with our revenue recognition policies described below and in Note 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements, interest income from licensing consists of imputed interest recognized from significant financing components identified in our license agreements with NAV Technology Licensees.\nSee Note 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur license agreements are accounted for as contracts with customers within the scope of Topic 606. At the inception of each license agreement, we determine the contract term for purposes of applying the requirements of Topic 606. Licenses are generally terminable at the option of the licensee with advance notice. For each license, we evaluate these termination rights to determine whether a substantive termination penalty would be incurred by the licensee upon termination. If the licensee incurs a substantive termination penalty upon termination, the contract term for revenue recognition purposes is generally equal to the stated term of the license, which is the life of the underlying licensed patents. Alternatively, if the licensee does not incur a substantive termination penalty upon termination, the contract term for revenue recognition purposes may be shorter than the stated term of the license, in which case the termination rights may be accounted for as contract renewal options. The determination of whether a substantive termination penalty is associated with the termination rights requires significant judgment. In making this determination, we consider, among other things, the nature of the intellectual property rights that would be returned to us upon termination, including the exclusivity of the licensed rights and the stage of development of the licensed products, the payment terms, including the amount and timing of non-refundable or guaranteed payments, and the business purpose of the termination rights granted to the licensee. We consider all of the facts and circumstances relevant to each license when making this determination.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses increased by $9.6 million, from $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Stock-based Awards\n \u2022 continued acquisition and manufacture of clinical trial materials in support of our anticipated clinical trials. \n \u2022 the costs of future product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution activities for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; \nUp-front and annual licenses fees payable to us over the contract term of each license are included in the transaction price, and the portion of this consideration that is allocated to the performance obligation for the delivery of the intellectual property license is recognized as revenue in full upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. If annual license fees are payable to us in periods beyond 12 months from the delivery of the license, a significant financing component is deemed to exist which provides a financing benefit to the licensee. If a significant financing component is identified, we adjust the transaction price for the license to include only the present value of the annual license fees payable to us over the contract term. The discounted portion of the license fees is recognized as interest income from licensing in the consolidated statements of operations over the financing period of the license.\nIncome Taxes\nTo date, we have primarily generated revenue through license agreements with strategic partners for research, development and commercialization of product candidates using our proprietary technology. We do not expect to generate significant recurring revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue to expand the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.\nExamples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, stock-based compensation and travel, for our scientific personnel performing research and development activities; \n \u2022 an increase of $0.6 million for professional services, primarily attributable to commercial consulting services. \n\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, excluding the items discussed above:\nWe have entered into a number of long-term leases for office and laboratory space in Rockville, Maryland and New York, New York, as well as a number of laboratory and other equipment leases. The table below includes the future minimum lease payments under our lease agreements.\n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \nRevenue Recognition\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash used in operating activities of $48.6 million consisted of a net loss of $63.0 million, offset by $9.2 million in adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital of $5.2 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expenses of $7.0 million and net amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities of $2.0 million. The change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.1 million, an increase in deferred rent of $1.3 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.1 million, and was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.9 million.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nIn addition to our lead product candidates, we have also funded, and plan to continue to fund, preclinical research on potential product candidate programs that may become part of our internal product development pipeline. We have partnered with a number of leading academic institutions and will continue to seek partnerships with innovative institutions to develop novel NAV gene therapy product candidates.\nRevenues\n \u2022 RGX-501: We are developing RGX-501 for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a severe genetic disease characterized by premature and aggressive plaque buildup, life threatening coronary artery disease and aortic valve disease predominantly due to abnormalities in the function or expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Enrollment in the Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-501 began in March 2017. We have completed dosing of the first cohort of three subjects and have dosed three subjects in the second cohort, a total of six subjects. We have amended the clinical trial protocol and expect to enroll additional subjects using steroid prophylaxis. \n \u2022 RGX-181: We are developing RGX-181 for the treatment of late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, one of the most common forms of Batten disease, caused by mutations in the tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) gene. We plan to submit an IND application for RGX-181 for the treatment of CLN2 to the FDA in the second half of 2019 to enable initiation of a first-in-human clinical trial. \n\nWe estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders with service providers, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed, the expected remaining period of performance and the associated expenses incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. Depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the estimated expenses incurred, we may record net prepaid or accrued research and development expenses relating to these costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses increased by $3.6 million, from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expenses increased by $11.7 million, from $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nLicense revenue\n \u2022 RGX-314: Our lead product candidate RGX-314 is for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), a leading cause of total and partial vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan. We began enrollment in the Phase I/IIa clinical trial for RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD in May 2017 and have completed dosing of 30 total subjects in four cohorts, including six subjects in each of the first three cohorts and 12 subjects in the fourth cohort. We expect to initiate a Phase IIb trial in late 2019. \nInvestment Income. Investment income increased by $4.4 million, from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our investment portfolio in 2018, which was largely driven by cash inflows from our licensing arrangements as well as the net proceeds received from the public offering of our common stock completed in August 2018.\n \u2022 our planned expansion of the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform; \nOur net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $162.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $180.0 million in license payments received in 2018 related to the amendment of our March 2014 license agreement with AveXis, and was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses during the period. Net cash used in operating activities increased by $9.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses during the period. The increases in operating expenses during the periods were primarily attributable to increased employee headcount and increases in external research and development expenses as we continue the development and advancement of our lead product candidates.\nTable 373: <table> <tr> <td>\n \u2022 the results of our clinical trials; \nOur research and development expense primarily consists of:\n \u2022 continued investment in advanced manufacturing analytics and process development activities; and \n \u2022 the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies. \nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nIn August 2018, we completed a public offering of 3,105,000 shares of our common stock (inclusive of 405,000 shares pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) at a price of $65.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering, inclusive of the underwriters' option exercise, were $189.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\n \u2022 a Phase I/IIa clinical trial and a planned Phase IIb clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-314 program for the treatment of wet AMD, and a planned Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-314 program for the treatment of an additional retinal condition; \n \u2022 costs related to acquiring, developing and manufacturing materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials; \nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nDevelopment milestone payments are payable to us upon the achievement of specified development milestones by licensees. At the inception of each license agreement that contains development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of achievement and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in the future, milestone payments are included in the transaction price and recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the license. Milestone payments contingent on the achievement of development milestones that are not within our control or the control of the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved and are excluded from the transaction price until the milestone is achieved. At each reporting date, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of outstanding development milestones and, if necessary, adjust the transaction price for any milestones for which the probability of achievement has changed due to current facts and circumstances. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis and recognized as revenue in the period of the adjustment.\n \u2022 The assumed dividend yield is zero is based on our history of not paying dividends and expectation of not paying dividends for the foreseeable future. \nIn January 2018, we amended our March 2014 license agreement (the January 2018 Amendment) with AveXis which modified its terms and conditions and provided additional intellectual property rights to AveXis. In consideration for the additional rights granted under the amended license agreement, AveXis paid us $80.0 million upon the effective date of the amendment. In addition, AveXis was obligated to pay us (i) $30.0 million on the first anniversary of the effective date of the January 2018 Amendment, (ii) $30.0 million on the second anniversary of the effective date of the January 2018 Amendment and (iii) potential sales-based milestone payments of up to $120.0 million. In the event of a change of control of AveXis, to the extent that any fee described in (i) or (ii) above, or the first $40.0 million of milestone payments described in (iii) above, had not yet been paid to us, AveXis was obligated to pay any such unpaid fee to us upon the change of control. In May 2018, AveXis was acquired by Novartis. AveXis paid us $100.0 million in accelerated license payments following the change of control. Pursuant to the amended license agreement, AveXis is obligated to pay us $80.0 million upon the achievement of a sales-based milestone, in addition to other regulatory milestone payments and royalties on net sales of licensed products. In January 2019, Novartis announced that it expects to launch ZOLGENSMA in 2019, pending approval by regulatory authorities. If approved, ZOLGENSMA which will be the first approved product under the amended March 2014 license agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $445.8 million to purchase marketable securities and $13.3 million to purchase property and equipment, offset by $179.7 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities.\nIn December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which allowed us to record provisional amounts for the effects of the TCJA in the period it was enacted for a measurement period not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. Under SAB 118, we recorded a provisional reduction in our deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowance of $17.9 million in 2017 for the effects of the TCJA, which was primarily attributable to the reduction in federal tax rates. We have completed our assessment of the final impact of the TCJA within the required measurement period under SAB 118 and determined that there were no material adjustments to the provisional amounts previously recorded.\n\n \u2022 other costs in seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 an increase of $2.1 million for professional services, including legal, accounting and other advisory services. \nOperating Activities\n prices for the selected companies' shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option awards. For the purpose of identifying the selected peer group companies, we consider characteristics such as enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry and length of historical share price information. We focus our peer group company selection on companies that operate within the biotechnology industry, and specifically on companies that use gene therapy, or similar technologies, for treating diseases and/or are focused on treating diseases in our development pipeline or our licensees' pipelines. We plan to continue using historical peer group volatility data as an input to estimate expected volatility until a sufficient amount of historical volatility data for our common stock becomes available. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $68.6 million to purchase marketable securities and $7.2 million to purchase property and equipment, offset by $71.0 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities.\n</table>\n \u2022 Our common stock has only been publicly traded since September 2015 and, accordingly, we do not have sufficient historical and implied volatility data for our common stock necessary to estimate the expected the volatility of our common stock over a period of time commensurate with the expected term of our stock option awards. As a result, we estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of both our common stock and the common stock of a selected peer group of similar publicly traded companies for which sufficient historical volatility data is available. Due to the lack of historical volatility data for our common stock, we place a higher weight on the historical volatility of the selected peer group in estimating expected volatility. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing \nFinancing Activities\nWe receive payments from licensees based on the billing schedules established in each license agreement. Amounts recognized as revenue which have not yet been received from licensees are recorded as accounts receivable when our rights to the consideration are conditional solely upon the passage of time. Amounts recognized as revenue which have not yet been received from licensees are recorded as contract assets when our rights to the consideration are not unconditional. Contract assets are recorded as other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. If a licensee elects to terminate a license prior to the end of the license term, the licensed intellectual property is returned to us and any consideration recorded as accounts receivable or contract assets which is not contractually payable by the licensee is charged off as a reduction of license revenue in the period of the termination. Amounts received from licensees prior to the delivery of underlying performance obligations are deferred and recognized as revenue upon the satisfaction of the performance obligations. Deferred revenue which is not expected to be recognized within 12 months from the reporting date is recorded as non-current on the consolidated balance sheets.\n \u2022 an increase of $2.3 million for personnel costs as a result of increased headcount of general and administrative personnel, including a $1.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense; and \nOur operating expenses consist primarily of costs of revenue, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We allocate indirect expenses associated with our facilities, information technology costs, depreciation and other overhead costs between research and development and general and administrative categories based on employee headcount and the nature of work performed by each employee.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe license our NAV Technology Platform to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. As of December 31, 2018, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in the development of more than 20 partnered product candidates by 11 NAV Technology Licensees. The terms of the licenses vary, and licenses may be exclusive or non-exclusive and may be sublicensable by the licensee. Licenses may grant intellectual property rights for purposes of internal and preclinical research and development only, or may include the rights, or options to obtain future rights, to commercialize drug therapies for specific diseases using the NAV Technology Platform. License agreements generally have a term at least equal to the life of the underlying patents, but are terminable at the option of the licensee. Consideration from licensees under our license agreements may include: (i) up-front and annual fees, (ii) option fees to acquire additional licenses, (iii) milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones by licensees, (iv) sublicense fees and (v) royalties on sales of licensed products. To date we have not recognized any revenue from the achievement of sales-based milestones or royalties on sales of licensed products.\nFinancial Overview\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including (i) the fair value of the underlying common stock, (ii) the expected stock price volatility, (iii) the expected term of the award, (iv) the risk-free interest rate and (v) expected dividends. In applying these assumptions, we consider the following factors:\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n \u2022 The fair value of our common stock used to determine the exercise price and fair value of our stock options is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant. \nCash Flows\n \u2022 an increase of $6.1 million for laboratory costs and facilities and equipment used by research and development personnel, including a $1.3 million increase in depreciation expense allocated to research and development functions; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash used in operating activities of $58.0 million consisted of a net loss of $73.2 million, offset by $14.3 million in adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital of $0.9 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expenses of $10.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 million and net amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities of $1.8 million. The change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.5 million, and was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses of $3.6 million.\n\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 an increase of $5.7 million for personnel costs as a result of increased headcount of general and administrative personnel, including a $3.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense; and \n\nOur stock-based awards are subject to either service or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployees with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the estimated grant date fair value over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployees with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the estimated grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable.\n \u2022 RGX-111: We are developing RGX-111 for the treatment of the neurological symptoms of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I), a severe genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of \u03b1-l-iduronidase (IDUA), an enzyme required for breakdown of cellular waste products. The investigational new drug (IND) application filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) for RGX-111 for the treatment of MPS I is active, we have submitted an application to the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) to proceed with a Phase I clinical trial evaluating RGX-111 for treatment of MPS I and we expect to begin enrollment in a Phase I clinical trial in mid-2019. \nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this report, based on our current business plan. We intend to devote the majority of our current capital to clinical development and seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of gene therapy product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amount of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. Additionally, our estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\n \u2022 allocated facility-related costs, depreciation expense and other overhead. \n \u2022 $176.1 million of revenue recognized under our March 2014 license agreement, as amended in January 2018, with AveXis, Inc. (AveXis) for the development and commercialization of treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA); and \nIn addition to our internal product development efforts, we also selectively sublicense our proprietary adeno-associated virus gene therapy delivery platform (NAV Technology Platform) to other leading biotechnology companies, which we refer to as NAV Technology Licensees. As of December 31, 2018, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in the development of more than 20 partnered product candidates by our NAV Technology Licensees. Sublicensing allows us to maintain our internal product development focus on our core disease indications and therapeutic areas while still expanding the NAV gene therapy pipeline, developing a greater breadth of treatments for patients, providing additional technological and potential clinical proof-of-concept for our NAV Technology Platform, and creating potential additional revenue.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-111 program for the treatment of MPS I; \n \u2022 an increase of $4.5 million for external costs associated with clinical trial activities for our lead product candidates; and \n \u2022 revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval; \nLicense Revenue. License revenue increased by $6.1 million, from $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $6.0 million of revenue recognized under our June 2017 license agreement with AveXis for the development and commercialization of treatments for Rett Syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in the gene that produces the copper zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1).\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue development of our product candidates. Our current and planned research and development activities include the following:\nITEM 7.\n \u2022 We estimate the risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of our stock options based on the rates of U.S. Treasury securities with maturity dates commensurate with the expected term of the associated awards. \n \u2022 RGX-121: We are developing RGX-121 for the treatment of the neurological symptoms of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II), a severe genetic lysosomal storage disease with a similar phenotype to MPS I. MPS II is caused by deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), an enzyme that is also responsible for breakdown of cellular waste products. We have begun dosing subjects in the Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-121 and we expect to continue enrollment and site activation in 2019. \nInterest Income from Licensing\nFuture license revenue is highly dependent on the successful development and commercialization of licensed products by our licensees, which is uncertain, and revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Additionally, we may never receive consideration in our license agreements that is contemplated on option fees, development and sales-based milestone payments, royalties on sales of licensed products or sublicense fees, given the contingent nature of these payments. Our license revenue is concentrated among a low number of licensees and licenses are terminable at the option of the licensee. The termination of our licenses by licensees may materially impact the amount of license revenue we recognize in future periods. Please refer to Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of segment and geographical information regarding our license revenue.\nThe increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 million for externally sourced preclinical research and development services related to our lead product candidates and the advancement of our technology and other potential product candidates.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nWe have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including our NOL and credit carryforwards. Based on our history of operating losses, we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our intellectual property, our product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\n \u2022 an increase of $10.9 million for personnel costs as a result of increased headcount of research and development personnel, including a $2.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 costs related to executing preclinical studies and clinical trials; ", "item_7_text": " \u2022 our current licensing agreements or collaborations remaining in effect; \nExpenses incurred in the development of RGX-181 were included in unallocated external expenses through the second quarter of 2018. We typically utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We do not allocate personnel and other internal costs, such as facilities and other overhead costs, to specific product candidates or development programs.\n \u2022 the timing of enrollment, commencement and completion of our clinical trials; \n \u2022 contract research organizations in connection with preclinical development and clinical studies; \nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which supersedes ASC 840, Leases (Topic 840) and provides principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. We will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition method and will apply Topic 842 to leases in effect as of, or entered into after, the adoption date. The cumulative impact of adoption will be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit on January 1, 2019 and prior periods will not be adjusted. This adoption approach will result in a consolidated balance sheet that may not be comparable to prior periods in the first year of adoption. Upon adoption, we expect to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to our operating leases for office and laboratory facilities and equipment. The right-of-use assets and related liabilities may be material. Additionally, upon adoption, we expect to derecognize $5.9 million of property and equipment and $5.9 million of financing lease obligations related to construction-in-progress at 9800 Medical Center Drive, as we do not control the building during the construction period under the requirements of Topic 842. We do not expect the adoption of Topic 842 to have a material impact on our results of operations. Please refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our adoption of Topic 842.\nResults of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOther Income\nIn March 2017, we completed a public offering of 3,700,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.50 per share. In connection with the offering, we granted the underwriters an option to purchase 555,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price. The underwriters exercised the option in full and purchased the additional shares in April 2017. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering, inclusive of the underwriters' option exercise, were $81.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\n \u2022 service providers for professional service fees such as consulting and other research and development related services. \nOur understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing may vary and may result in us reporting changes in estimates in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nOverview of Product Candidates\nDue to the non-recurring license revenue recognized in 2018 under the AveXis and Abeona licenses discussed above, we currently expect 2019 revenues to be substantially lower than 2018 revenues. In January 2019, Novartis AG (Novartis), which acquired AveXis in May 2018, announced that it expects to launch ZOLGENSMA\u00ae in 2019, pending approval by regulatory authorities. If approved, ZOLGENSMA will be the first approved product under our amended March 2014 license agreement with AveXis. Upon its approval and launch, we will begin recognizing royalty revenue on net sales of ZOLGENSMA.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nInvestment income consists of interest income earned and gains and losses realized from our cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market mutual funds and highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of 90 days or less at acquisition. Marketable securities are comprised of fixed income debt securities.\n \u2022 fees paid to consultants and other third-parties who support our product candidate development; \n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain additional licensing agreements or collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and \n \u2022 the results of our preclinical studies for our product candidates and any subsequent clinical trials; \nCosts of revenue consist primarily of sublicense fees to licensors as a result of revenues generated from the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform. Sublicense fees are based on a percentage of license fees we receive from licensees as specified in the agreements with our licensors. We recognize sublicense fees in the period that the underlying license revenue is recognized. Future costs of revenue are uncertain due to the nature of our license agreements and significant fluctuations in costs of revenue may occur from period to period.\nResearch and Development Expense\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $470.6 million, which were primarily derived from the sale of common stock, as described below. Additionally, we have supplemented our cash flows with fees received from granting commercial licenses to our proprietary technology to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at the least the next 12 months from the date of this report, based on our current business plan.\n \u2022 the costs associated with building out additional laboratory and manufacturing capacity, if any; \nWe evaluate our contracts for the presence of significant financing components. If a significant financing component is identified in a contract and provides a financing benefit to the customer, the transaction price for the contract is adjusted to account for the financing portion of the arrangement, which is recognized as interest income over the financing term using the effective interest method. In determining the appropriate interest rates for significant financing components, we evaluate the credit profile of the customer and prevailing market interest rates and select an interest rate in which we believe would be charged to the customer in a separate financing arrangement over a similar financing term.\nOur principal commitments include obligations under vendor contracts to provide research services and other purchase commitments with our vendors. In the normal course of business, we enter into services agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and other third-parties. Generally, these agreements provide for termination upon notice, with specified amounts due upon termination based on the timing of termination and the terms of the agreement. The actual amounts and timing of payments under these agreements are uncertain and contingent upon the initiation and completion of the services to be provided. These amounts are not fixed and determinable and therefore are not included in the table below.\n \u2022 We estimate the expected term of plain vanilla\u201d stock options granted to employees based on the simplified method in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 107 and 110, as our common stock has only been publicly traded since September 2015. Using the simplified method, the expected term of the award equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. We expect to use the simplified method to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees until we have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. For stock options granted to nonemployees, we use the contractual term of the award rather than the expected term to estimate the fair value of the award. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities consisted of $72.6 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $45.1 million to purchase marketable securities and $8.1 million to purchase property and equipment.\n \u2022 $35.6 million of revenue recognized under our November 2018 license agreement with Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Abeona) for the development and commercialization of treatments for various diseases. \nMany of these factors are outside of our control. Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory and marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our product revenues, if any, and any commercial milestones or royalty payments under our licensing agreements, will be derived from or based on sales of products that may not be commercially available for many years, if at all. In addition, revenue from our NAV Technology Platform sublicensing is dependent in part on the clinical and commercial success of our licensing partners. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $189.1 million in aggregate net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and additional offering expenses we paid during the period, and $15.3 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $56.1 million, U.S. state NOL carryforwards of $56.2 million and federal research and development credit carryforwards of $29.1 million which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2038.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $0.2 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.\nWe have developed an internal pipeline of product candidates across the therapeutic areas of retinal, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.\nStock-based Compensation\n \u2022 an increase of $2.5 million for laboratory costs and externally sourced manufacturing-related and process development services; and \nThe transaction price for each license agreement is allocated to the underlying performance obligations and recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. Consideration allocated to performance obligations for the delivery of an intellectual property license is recognized as revenue in full upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. Consideration allocated to performance obligations for license options is recognized as revenue in full upon the earlier of the option exercise or expiration. The exercise of a license option by a licensee is accounted for as a new license for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe evaluate the transaction price of our license agreements at the inception of each agreement and at each reporting date. The transaction price includes the fixed consideration payable to us during the contract term, as well as any variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur in the future. Fixed consideration under the license agreements includes up-front and annual fees payable during the contract term. Variable consideration under the license agreements includes development and sales-based milestone payments, sublicense fees and royalties on sales of licensed products. Consideration contingent upon the exercise of options by a licensee is excluded from the transaction price and not accounted for as part of the license agreement until the option is exercised.\nImpact of Adoption of Topic 606\nOur significant accounting policies and recently announced accounting pronouncements, including the expected impact of such pronouncements, are fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee travel, benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes personnel in executive, commercial, corporate development, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and administrative support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related and overhead costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for accounting, legal and advisory services, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, insurance costs, costs of our information systems and other commercial and general corporate activities. We expect that our general and administrative expense will continue to increase as we continue to develop, and potentially commercialize, our product candidates.\n \u2022 a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-501 program for the treatment of HoFH; \n \u2022 a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-121 program for the treatment of MPS II; \nWe recorded a net reduction in opening accumulated deficit of $4.8 million as of January 1, 2018 for the cumulative impact of adoption of Topic 606, which was primarily the result of accelerated recognition of license revenue related to annual license fees under Topic 606. Under Topic 605, annual license fees payable to us by licensees were recognized as license revenue annually when the amounts became fixed or determinable. Under Topic 606, the present value of aggregate annual license fees over the contract term of the license agreement are recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. The impact of the accelerated recognition of license revenue upon adoption was partially offset by the accelerated recognition of licensing costs to our licensors. We recognize sublicense fees to our licensors in the period the underlying license revenue is recognized.\nWe estimate the fair value of our restricted stock units based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant.\n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, laboratory testing, preclinical development and clinical trials for our product candidates; \nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur commitments include obligations to our licensors under our in-license agreements, which may include sublicense fees, milestones fees, royalties and reimbursement of patent maintenance costs. Sublicense fees are due to the licensors when we sublicense underlying intellectual property to third-parties; the fees are based on a percentage of the license fees we receive from the sublicensees. Based on license fees we have received from sublicensees or recorded as accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018, we have accrued $4.1 million of sublicense fees payable to our licensors, of which $1.6 million is expected to be paid in 2019 and $2.5 million is expected to be paid in periods beyond 2019. The actual amount of sublicense fees payable in future periods could differ materially if new licenses are granted to sublicensees, existing licenses are terminated by sublicensees or if certain other contingent consideration, such as milestone payments, is received from sublicensees in the future. Accordingly, the amount of sublicense fees payable in future periods is not fixed and determinable and therefore is not included in the table below. Milestone fees are payable by us upon our future achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Royalty fees are based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products. Maintenance costs are reimbursements to the licensors for maintaining licensed patents. These amounts are not fixed and determinable and therefore are not included in the table below.\nOverview\nWe have incurred cumulative losses since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of $83.0 million as of December 31, 2018. Our transition to recurring profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We do not expect to achieve such revenues, and expect to continue to incur losses, for at least the next several years. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we expect our capital expenditures will increase significantly in the future for costs associated with building out additional office, laboratory and manufacturing capacity. As a result, we will need significant additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain through one or more equity offerings, debt financings or other third-party funding, including potential strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA) was signed into law in December 2017 and, among other changes, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, elimination, reduction or limitation of certain domestic deductions and credits, limitation of the deduction for NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income, elimination of NOL carrybacks, one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain significant exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits, including the orphan drug tax credit. Most of the changes resulting from the TCJA were effective beginning in 2018.\nInterest Income from Licensing. Interest income from licensing increased by $8.9 million, from zero for the year ended December 31, 2017. In January 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition standards under Topic 606, the requirements of which have not been retrospectively applied to prior periods. Under Topic 606, we impute and recognize interest income related to significant financing components identified in our license agreements with NAV Technology Licensees. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $8.0 million of interest income under our amended March 2014 license agreement with AveXis and $0.4 million of interest income under our November 2018 license agreement with Abeona.\n \u2022 contract manufacturing organizations and other vendors related to process development and manufacturing of materials for use in preclinical development and clinical studies; and \nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, you should read the Risk Factors\u201d and Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). We adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method and have applied the new standard to all of our license agreements in effect as of January 1, 2018. License revenue for periods ending after January 1, 2018 is presented in accordance with the requirements of Topic 606, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with Topic 605 and accordingly, may not be comparable.\nOverview of Our NAV Technology Platform\nInvestment Income\nUnder the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. We have completed several financings since our inception which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or could result in a change in control in the future.\n \u2022 an increase of $10.2 million for personnel costs as a result of increased headcount of research and development personnel, including a $2.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 preclinical research and development for our RGX-181 program for the treatment of CLN2; \nPerformance obligations under our license agreements may include (i) the delivery of intellectual property licenses and (ii) options granted to licensees to acquire additional licenses to the extent the options represent material rights to the licensee. At the inception of each license agreement which contains options for the licensee to acquire additional licenses, or contract renewal options, we evaluate the options to determine whether they provide material rights to the licensee. In making this determination, we consider whether the options are priced at a discount to the standalone selling price for the underlying licenses. If an option is priced at a discount to the standalone selling price for the underlying license, the option is considered to be a material right to the licensee and is accounted for as a separate performance obligation under the current license agreement.\nLicense Revenue. License revenue increased by $208.1 million, from $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $218.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the following license revenue recognized during 2018:\nWe license our NAV Technology Platform to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The terms of the licenses vary, and licenses may be exclusive or non-exclusive and may be sublicensable by the licensee. Licenses may grant intellectual property rights for purposes of internal and preclinical research and development only, or may include the rights, or options to obtain future rights, to commercialize drug therapies for specific diseases using the NAV Technology Platform. License agreements generally have a term at least equal to the life of the underlying patents, but are terminable at the option of the licensee. Consideration payable to us under our license agreements may include: (i) up-front and annual fees, (ii) option fees to acquire additional licenses, (iii) milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones by licensees, (iv) sublicense fees and (v) royalties on sales of licensed products.\nCosts of Revenue\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). Topic 606 requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are performed to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligations.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash provided by operating activities of $104.6 million consisted of net income of $99.9 million and $12.5 million in adjustments for non-cash items, offset by changes in working capital of $7.8 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expenses of $16.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $4.0 million and net amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities of $0.8 million and were partially offset by imputed interest earned from our license agreements of $8.9 million. The change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable of $16.8 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.5 million and an increase in other assets of $1.5 million, and was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $7.6 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $3.9 million and an increased in other liabilities of $1.7 million. The increase in accounts receivable is largely driven by $26.0 million of accounts receivable recorded as of December 31, 2018 related to the November 2018 license with Abeona, and was partially offset by the imputed interest recognized upon the acceleration of license payments under our amended license agreement with AveXis. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities is largely driven by increases in accrued personnel costs, accrued external research and development expenses and accrued licensing costs as of December 31, 2018. The increase in deferred revenue is largely driven by consideration received from licensees during the period for license options which represent unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nOn July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-based Payment Accounting. Prior to the adoption of this standard, compensation expense for our stock-based awards to nonemployees was based on the then-current fair value of the awards at each reporting date prior to the measurement date, which is generally the vesting date. Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-07, these awards will no longer be remeasured and any new stock-based awards granted to nonemployees after the adoption of the new standard will be measured at the estimated grant date fair value of the awards.\nTo date, we have primarily generated revenues through the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform to NAV Technology Licensees. We have not generated any revenues from the sale of approved products. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner, or fail to obtain their regulatory approval, our ability to generate future revenues will be materially compromised.\n</td> </tr>\nRoyalties on sales of licensed products, sales-based milestone payments and sublicense fees based on the receipt of certain fees by licensees from any sublicensees are excluded from the transaction price of each license and recognized as revenue in the period that the related sales or sublicenses occur, provided that the associated license has been delivered to the licensee. To date we have not recognized any revenue from royalties on sales of licensed products or the achievement of sales-based milestones.\nInvesting Activities\n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $81.5 million in aggregate net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and additional offering expenses we paid during the period, and $3.0 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nWe apply the five-step model to contracts that are within the scope of Topic 606 only when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, for contracts within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to respective performance obligations when (or as) the respective performance obligations are satisfied.\n \u2022 an increase of $3.5 million for externally sourced manufacturing-related and process development services. \n \u2022 an increase of $2.3 million for facilities and equipment used by research and development personnel, including a $1.9 million increase in depreciation expense allocated to research and development functions, primarily as a result of our advanced manufacturing and analytics laboratory which opened in early 2017. \n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur stock-based awards include stock options granted to employees and nonemployees, restricted stock units and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expenses increased by $26.6 million, from $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nUp-front fees incurred in obtaining technology licenses for research and development activities are expensed as incurred if the technology licensed has no alternative future use.\nWe are a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy. Our gene therapy product candidates are designed to deliver genes to cells to address genetic defects or to enable cells in the body to produce therapeutic proteins that are intended to impact disease. Through a single administration, our gene therapy product candidates are designed to provide long-lasting effects, potentially significantly altering the course of disease and delivering improved patient outcomes.\nThe increase in license revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 also resulted in a $7.9 million increase in licensing costs incurred during the period related to the sublicense fees we are obligated to pay to our licensors.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\n \u2022 preclinical research and development for additional product candidates addressing other diseases in the retinal, metabolic and neurodegenerative therapeutic areas; \nIn accordance with our revenue recognition policies described below and in Note 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements, interest income from licensing consists of imputed interest recognized from significant financing components identified in our license agreements with NAV Technology Licensees.\nSee Note 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur license agreements are accounted for as contracts with customers within the scope of Topic 606. At the inception of each license agreement, we determine the contract term for purposes of applying the requirements of Topic 606. Licenses are generally terminable at the option of the licensee with advance notice. For each license, we evaluate these termination rights to determine whether a substantive termination penalty would be incurred by the licensee upon termination. If the licensee incurs a substantive termination penalty upon termination, the contract term for revenue recognition purposes is generally equal to the stated term of the license, which is the life of the underlying licensed patents. Alternatively, if the licensee does not incur a substantive termination penalty upon termination, the contract term for revenue recognition purposes may be shorter than the stated term of the license, in which case the termination rights may be accounted for as contract renewal options. The determination of whether a substantive termination penalty is associated with the termination rights requires significant judgment. In making this determination, we consider, among other things, the nature of the intellectual property rights that would be returned to us upon termination, including the exclusivity of the licensed rights and the stage of development of the licensed products, the payment terms, including the amount and timing of non-refundable or guaranteed payments, and the business purpose of the termination rights granted to the licensee. We consider all of the facts and circumstances relevant to each license when making this determination.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses increased by $9.6 million, from $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Stock-based Awards\n \u2022 continued acquisition and manufacture of clinical trial materials in support of our anticipated clinical trials. \n \u2022 the costs of future product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution activities for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; \nUp-front and annual licenses fees payable to us over the contract term of each license are included in the transaction price, and the portion of this consideration that is allocated to the performance obligation for the delivery of the intellectual property license is recognized as revenue in full upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. If annual license fees are payable to us in periods beyond 12 months from the delivery of the license, a significant financing component is deemed to exist which provides a financing benefit to the licensee. If a significant financing component is identified, we adjust the transaction price for the license to include only the present value of the annual license fees payable to us over the contract term. The discounted portion of the license fees is recognized as interest income from licensing in the consolidated statements of operations over the financing period of the license.\nIncome Taxes\nTo date, we have primarily generated revenue through license agreements with strategic partners for research, development and commercialization of product candidates using our proprietary technology. We do not expect to generate significant recurring revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue to expand the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.\nExamples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, stock-based compensation and travel, for our scientific personnel performing research and development activities; \n \u2022 an increase of $0.6 million for professional services, primarily attributable to commercial consulting services. \n\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, excluding the items discussed above:\nWe have entered into a number of long-term leases for office and laboratory space in Rockville, Maryland and New York, New York, as well as a number of laboratory and other equipment leases. The table below includes the future minimum lease payments under our lease agreements.\n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \nRevenue Recognition\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash used in operating activities of $48.6 million consisted of a net loss of $63.0 million, offset by $9.2 million in adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital of $5.2 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expenses of $7.0 million and net amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities of $2.0 million. The change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.1 million, an increase in deferred rent of $1.3 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.1 million, and was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.9 million.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nIn addition to our lead product candidates, we have also funded, and plan to continue to fund, preclinical research on potential product candidate programs that may become part of our internal product development pipeline. We have partnered with a number of leading academic institutions and will continue to seek partnerships with innovative institutions to develop novel NAV gene therapy product candidates.\nRevenues\n \u2022 RGX-501: We are developing RGX-501 for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a severe genetic disease characterized by premature and aggressive plaque buildup, life threatening coronary artery disease and aortic valve disease predominantly due to abnormalities in the function or expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Enrollment in the Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-501 began in March 2017. We have completed dosing of the first cohort of three subjects and have dosed three subjects in the second cohort, a total of six subjects. We have amended the clinical trial protocol and expect to enroll additional subjects using steroid prophylaxis. \n \u2022 RGX-181: We are developing RGX-181 for the treatment of late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, one of the most common forms of Batten disease, caused by mutations in the tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) gene. We plan to submit an IND application for RGX-181 for the treatment of CLN2 to the FDA in the second half of 2019 to enable initiation of a first-in-human clinical trial. \n\nWe estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders with service providers, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed, the expected remaining period of performance and the associated expenses incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. Depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the estimated expenses incurred, we may record net prepaid or accrued research and development expenses relating to these costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses increased by $3.6 million, from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expenses increased by $11.7 million, from $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nLicense revenue\n \u2022 RGX-314: Our lead product candidate RGX-314 is for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), a leading cause of total and partial vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan. We began enrollment in the Phase I/IIa clinical trial for RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD in May 2017 and have completed dosing of 30 total subjects in four cohorts, including six subjects in each of the first three cohorts and 12 subjects in the fourth cohort. We expect to initiate a Phase IIb trial in late 2019. \nInvestment Income. Investment income increased by $4.4 million, from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our investment portfolio in 2018, which was largely driven by cash inflows from our licensing arrangements as well as the net proceeds received from the public offering of our common stock completed in August 2018.\n \u2022 our planned expansion of the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform; \nOur net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $162.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $180.0 million in license payments received in 2018 related to the amendment of our March 2014 license agreement with AveXis, and was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses during the period. Net cash used in operating activities increased by $9.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses during the period. The increases in operating expenses during the periods were primarily attributable to increased employee headcount and increases in external research and development expenses as we continue the development and advancement of our lead product candidates.\nTable 373: <table> <tr> <td>\n \u2022 the results of our clinical trials; \nOur research and development expense primarily consists of:\n \u2022 continued investment in advanced manufacturing analytics and process development activities; and \n \u2022 the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies. \nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nIn August 2018, we completed a public offering of 3,105,000 shares of our common stock (inclusive of 405,000 shares pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) at a price of $65.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering, inclusive of the underwriters' option exercise, were $189.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\n \u2022 a Phase I/IIa clinical trial and a planned Phase IIb clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-314 program for the treatment of wet AMD, and a planned Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-314 program for the treatment of an additional retinal condition; \n \u2022 costs related to acquiring, developing and manufacturing materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials; \nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nDevelopment milestone payments are payable to us upon the achievement of specified development milestones by licensees. At the inception of each license agreement that contains development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of achievement and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in the future, milestone payments are included in the transaction price and recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the license. Milestone payments contingent on the achievement of development milestones that are not within our control or the control of the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved and are excluded from the transaction price until the milestone is achieved. At each reporting date, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of outstanding development milestones and, if necessary, adjust the transaction price for any milestones for which the probability of achievement has changed due to current facts and circumstances. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis and recognized as revenue in the period of the adjustment.\n \u2022 The assumed dividend yield is zero is based on our history of not paying dividends and expectation of not paying dividends for the foreseeable future. \nIn January 2018, we amended our March 2014 license agreement (the January 2018 Amendment) with AveXis which modified its terms and conditions and provided additional intellectual property rights to AveXis. In consideration for the additional rights granted under the amended license agreement, AveXis paid us $80.0 million upon the effective date of the amendment. In addition, AveXis was obligated to pay us (i) $30.0 million on the first anniversary of the effective date of the January 2018 Amendment, (ii) $30.0 million on the second anniversary of the effective date of the January 2018 Amendment and (iii) potential sales-based milestone payments of up to $120.0 million. In the event of a change of control of AveXis, to the extent that any fee described in (i) or (ii) above, or the first $40.0 million of milestone payments described in (iii) above, had not yet been paid to us, AveXis was obligated to pay any such unpaid fee to us upon the change of control. In May 2018, AveXis was acquired by Novartis. AveXis paid us $100.0 million in accelerated license payments following the change of control. Pursuant to the amended license agreement, AveXis is obligated to pay us $80.0 million upon the achievement of a sales-based milestone, in addition to other regulatory milestone payments and royalties on net sales of licensed products. In January 2019, Novartis announced that it expects to launch ZOLGENSMA in 2019, pending approval by regulatory authorities. If approved, ZOLGENSMA which will be the first approved product under the amended March 2014 license agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $445.8 million to purchase marketable securities and $13.3 million to purchase property and equipment, offset by $179.7 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities.\nIn December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which allowed us to record provisional amounts for the effects of the TCJA in the period it was enacted for a measurement period not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. Under SAB 118, we recorded a provisional reduction in our deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowance of $17.9 million in 2017 for the effects of the TCJA, which was primarily attributable to the reduction in federal tax rates. We have completed our assessment of the final impact of the TCJA within the required measurement period under SAB 118 and determined that there were no material adjustments to the provisional amounts previously recorded.\n\n \u2022 other costs in seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 an increase of $2.1 million for professional services, including legal, accounting and other advisory services. \nOperating Activities\n prices for the selected companies' shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option awards. For the purpose of identifying the selected peer group companies, we consider characteristics such as enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry and length of historical share price information. We focus our peer group company selection on companies that operate within the biotechnology industry, and specifically on companies that use gene therapy, or similar technologies, for treating diseases and/or are focused on treating diseases in our development pipeline or our licensees' pipelines. We plan to continue using historical peer group volatility data as an input to estimate expected volatility until a sufficient amount of historical volatility data for our common stock becomes available. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $68.6 million to purchase marketable securities and $7.2 million to purchase property and equipment, offset by $71.0 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities.\n</table>\n \u2022 Our common stock has only been publicly traded since September 2015 and, accordingly, we do not have sufficient historical and implied volatility data for our common stock necessary to estimate the expected the volatility of our common stock over a period of time commensurate with the expected term of our stock option awards. As a result, we estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of both our common stock and the common stock of a selected peer group of similar publicly traded companies for which sufficient historical volatility data is available. Due to the lack of historical volatility data for our common stock, we place a higher weight on the historical volatility of the selected peer group in estimating expected volatility. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing \nFinancing Activities\nWe receive payments from licensees based on the billing schedules established in each license agreement. Amounts recognized as revenue which have not yet been received from licensees are recorded as accounts receivable when our rights to the consideration are conditional solely upon the passage of time. Amounts recognized as revenue which have not yet been received from licensees are recorded as contract assets when our rights to the consideration are not unconditional. Contract assets are recorded as other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. If a licensee elects to terminate a license prior to the end of the license term, the licensed intellectual property is returned to us and any consideration recorded as accounts receivable or contract assets which is not contractually payable by the licensee is charged off as a reduction of license revenue in the period of the termination. Amounts received from licensees prior to the delivery of underlying performance obligations are deferred and recognized as revenue upon the satisfaction of the performance obligations. Deferred revenue which is not expected to be recognized within 12 months from the reporting date is recorded as non-current on the consolidated balance sheets.\n \u2022 an increase of $2.3 million for personnel costs as a result of increased headcount of general and administrative personnel, including a $1.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense; and \nOur operating expenses consist primarily of costs of revenue, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We allocate indirect expenses associated with our facilities, information technology costs, depreciation and other overhead costs between research and development and general and administrative categories based on employee headcount and the nature of work performed by each employee.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe license our NAV Technology Platform to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. As of December 31, 2018, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in the development of more than 20 partnered product candidates by 11 NAV Technology Licensees. The terms of the licenses vary, and licenses may be exclusive or non-exclusive and may be sublicensable by the licensee. Licenses may grant intellectual property rights for purposes of internal and preclinical research and development only, or may include the rights, or options to obtain future rights, to commercialize drug therapies for specific diseases using the NAV Technology Platform. License agreements generally have a term at least equal to the life of the underlying patents, but are terminable at the option of the licensee. Consideration from licensees under our license agreements may include: (i) up-front and annual fees, (ii) option fees to acquire additional licenses, (iii) milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones by licensees, (iv) sublicense fees and (v) royalties on sales of licensed products. To date we have not recognized any revenue from the achievement of sales-based milestones or royalties on sales of licensed products.\nFinancial Overview\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including (i) the fair value of the underlying common stock, (ii) the expected stock price volatility, (iii) the expected term of the award, (iv) the risk-free interest rate and (v) expected dividends. In applying these assumptions, we consider the following factors:\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n \u2022 The fair value of our common stock used to determine the exercise price and fair value of our stock options is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant. \nCash Flows\n \u2022 an increase of $6.1 million for laboratory costs and facilities and equipment used by research and development personnel, including a $1.3 million increase in depreciation expense allocated to research and development functions; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash used in operating activities of $58.0 million consisted of a net loss of $73.2 million, offset by $14.3 million in adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital of $0.9 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expenses of $10.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 million and net amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities of $1.8 million. The change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.5 million, and was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses of $3.6 million.\n\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 an increase of $5.7 million for personnel costs as a result of increased headcount of general and administrative personnel, including a $3.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense; and \n\nOur stock-based awards are subject to either service or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployees with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the estimated grant date fair value over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployees with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the estimated grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable.\n \u2022 RGX-111: We are developing RGX-111 for the treatment of the neurological symptoms of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I), a severe genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of \u03b1-l-iduronidase (IDUA), an enzyme required for breakdown of cellular waste products. The investigational new drug (IND) application filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) for RGX-111 for the treatment of MPS I is active, we have submitted an application to the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) to proceed with a Phase I clinical trial evaluating RGX-111 for treatment of MPS I and we expect to begin enrollment in a Phase I clinical trial in mid-2019. \nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this report, based on our current business plan. We intend to devote the majority of our current capital to clinical development and seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of gene therapy product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amount of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. Additionally, our estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\n \u2022 allocated facility-related costs, depreciation expense and other overhead. \n \u2022 $176.1 million of revenue recognized under our March 2014 license agreement, as amended in January 2018, with AveXis, Inc. (AveXis) for the development and commercialization of treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA); and \nIn addition to our internal product development efforts, we also selectively sublicense our proprietary adeno-associated virus gene therapy delivery platform (NAV Technology Platform) to other leading biotechnology companies, which we refer to as NAV Technology Licensees. As of December 31, 2018, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in the development of more than 20 partnered product candidates by our NAV Technology Licensees. Sublicensing allows us to maintain our internal product development focus on our core disease indications and therapeutic areas while still expanding the NAV gene therapy pipeline, developing a greater breadth of treatments for patients, providing additional technological and potential clinical proof-of-concept for our NAV Technology Platform, and creating potential additional revenue.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our RGX-111 program for the treatment of MPS I; \n \u2022 an increase of $4.5 million for external costs associated with clinical trial activities for our lead product candidates; and \n \u2022 revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval; \nLicense Revenue. License revenue increased by $6.1 million, from $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $6.0 million of revenue recognized under our June 2017 license agreement with AveXis for the development and commercialization of treatments for Rett Syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in the gene that produces the copper zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1).\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue development of our product candidates. Our current and planned research and development activities include the following:\nITEM 7.\n \u2022 We estimate the risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of our stock options based on the rates of U.S. Treasury securities with maturity dates commensurate with the expected term of the associated awards. \n \u2022 RGX-121: We are developing RGX-121 for the treatment of the neurological symptoms of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II), a severe genetic lysosomal storage disease with a similar phenotype to MPS I. MPS II is caused by deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), an enzyme that is also responsible for breakdown of cellular waste products. We have begun dosing subjects in the Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-121 and we expect to continue enrollment and site activation in 2019. \nInterest Income from Licensing\nFuture license revenue is highly dependent on the successful development and commercialization of licensed products by our licensees, which is uncertain, and revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Additionally, we may never receive consideration in our license agreements that is contemplated on option fees, development and sales-based milestone payments, royalties on sales of licensed products or sublicense fees, given the contingent nature of these payments. Our license revenue is concentrated among a low number of licensees and licenses are terminable at the option of the licensee. The termination of our licenses by licensees may materially impact the amount of license revenue we recognize in future periods. Please refer to Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of segment and geographical information regarding our license revenue.\nThe increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 million for externally sourced preclinical research and development services related to our lead product candidates and the advancement of our technology and other potential product candidates.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nWe have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including our NOL and credit carryforwards. Based on our history of operating losses, we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our intellectual property, our product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\n \u2022 an increase of $10.9 million for personnel costs as a result of increased headcount of research and development personnel, including a $2.5 million increase in
