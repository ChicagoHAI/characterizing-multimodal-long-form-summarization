We offer a wide range of in-house designed products including but not limited to gold necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, and pendants. In our jewelry business, we only sell on a wholesale basis to distributors and retailers. Pricing of our jewelry business products is made at the time of sale based upon the then- current price of gold and sales are made on a cash or credit on delivery basis.\nWe have developed our investments in gold as a business. We sell our investment gold products through banks. Similar to our jewelry business, pricing of our investment gold products is made at the time of sale based upon the then-current price of gold, and sales are made on a cash or credit on delivery basis.\nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales consists principally of the cost for raw materials, primarily gold. We generally purchase gold directly from the Shanghai Gold Exchange, of which we are a member. We lease gold from leading commercial banks in China to increase our gold supply and fuel our growth. We generally do not enter into long term purchase agreements for gold. During recent years, the price of gold on the international gold market has experienced periods of significant fluctuation. We have been attempting to offset gold price fluctuations by locking in the price at the time an order is placed, as well as passing on the price to purchasers.\nGross Profit, Gross Margin and Inventory Carrying Value\nOur gross profit margin and profitability as well as the carrying value of our inventory are affected by changes in the price of gold. If there is an increase in the price of gold that increases our production costs beyond the amount we may be able to pass to our customers, it has a negative effect on our gross margin and profitability. Furthermore, the carrying value of our inventory may be affected if the price of gold decreases relative to the price that we paid for that inventory. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately 3.7 and 3.5 metric tons of gold in our inventory for production, all of which had been sold in excess of the carrying value by the date of this report.\nInflation\nAlthough the Chinese government has implemented measures to curb inflation, it is foreseeable that the Chinese economy may remain under inflationary pressure at least for the near term. It is difficult to estimate the impact of continued rise in inflation on us. On the one hand, inflation may lead to, among other things, higher operating expenses for us and erosion of our customers' purchases, adversely affecting our results. On the other hand, inflation may also make our products more attractive to Chinese consumers who traditionally have perceived gold as a safe haven investment from inflation.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. While we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require significant judgments and estimates. For additional information relating to these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOn December 14, 2016, Wuhan Kingold transferred its 55% ownership interest in Kingold Internet to Wuhan Kingold Industrial Group Co., Ltd., a related party, for a consideration of $79,196 (RMB 550,000). After the transfer, Kingold Internet and Yuhuang were no longer the subsidiaries of Wuhan Kingold. Our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Kingold, Dragon Lead, Wuhan Vogue-Show and Wuhan Kingold. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nInventories\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value . Cost is determined using the weighted average method. We continually evaluate the composition of our inventory, turnover of our products, the price of gold and the ability of our customers to pay for their products. We write down slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on assessment of these factors, but principally customer demand. Such assessments require the exercise of significant judgment by management. Additionally, the value of our inventory may be affected by commodity prices. Decreases in the market value of gold would result in a lower stated value of our inventory, which may require us to take a charge for the decrease in the value. In addition, if the price of gold changes substantially in a very short period, it might trigger customer defaults, which could result in inventory obsolescence. If any of these factors were to become less favorable than those projected, inventory write-downs could be required, which would have a negative effect on our earnings and working capital.\nInvestments in Gold\nWe pledged the gold leased from related party and part of our own gold inventory to meet the requirements of bank loans. The pledged gold will be available for sale upon the repayment of the bank loans. We classified these pledged gold as investments in gold, and carried at fair market value, with the unrealized gains and losses, included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in shareholders' equity. The fair market value of the investments in gold is determined by quoted market prices at Shanghai Gold Exchange. Since the investments in gold are pledged for the bank loans, any material decrease in market value may negatively impact the loan covenants.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income (loss). The unrealized gain or loss resulting from the change of the fair market value and the foreign currency translation gain or loss resulting from translation of the financial statements expressed in RMB to US$ are reported in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and the consolidated statements of changes in equity and is net of tax.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe follow the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect management's assumptions based on the best available information.\nThe carrying value of all current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. We determined that the carrying value of the long term loans approximated their fair value by comparing the stated loan interest rate to the rate charged by similar financial institutions. We use quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of investments in gold.\nAccounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe long-lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes. The recoverability value of an asset to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of such asset against the future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. Our principal long-lived assets are our property, plant and equipment assets.\nWe must make various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets. We use set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management, and estimate the fair value of our reporting units by using undiscounted cash flow analyses. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for the underlying assets at such time. Any such resulting impairment charges could be material to our results of operations.\nIf the value of such an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less disposition costs. No events or changes in our business or circumstances required us to test for impairment of our long-lived assets during 2016 and 2015, and accordingly, we did not recognize any impairment loss during these periods.\nCompetitive pricing pressure and changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our long-lived assets, and thus could result in future impairment losses.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nOur net sales are primarily composed of sales of branded products to wholesale and retail customers, as well as fees generated from customized production. In customized production, a customer supplies the Company with the raw materials and the Company creates products per that customer's instructions, whereas in branded production the Company generally purchases gold directly and manufactures and markets the products on its own. The Company recognizes revenues under ASC 605 as follows:\nSales of branded products\nThe Company recognizes revenue on sales of branded products when the goods are delivered and title to the goods passes to the customer provided that: there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the sales price is fixed and determinable; and collectability is deemed probable.\nCustomized production fees\nThe Company recognizes services-based revenue (the processing fee) from such contracts for customized production when: (i) the contracted services have been performed and (ii) collectability is deemed probable.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nYEARS ENDED

December 31, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2,009.7 million, an increase of $589.1 million, or 41%, from net sales of $1,420.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our branded production sales accounted for 97.6% of the total sales and customized production sales accounted for 2.4% of the total sales. When comparing with 2016, our branded production sales increased by $563.8 million or 40.4%, our customized production sales increased by $25.3 million or 107.2%.\nThe overall increase in our revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to the following combined factors: (1) total sales volume (in terms of quantity sold) increased from 75.3 metric tons in 2016 to 103.4 metric tons in 2017, causing 28.1 metric tons or 37.2% increase. As a result, approximately $483.8 million increase in our revenue was attributable to the increase in our sales volume. (2) The average unit selling price for branded production increased from RMB 241.33 per gram in 2016 to RMB 257.20 per gram in 2017, causing 6.6% increase. As a result, approximately $91.9 million increase in brand production revenue was affected by the increase in our selling price. (3) The average unit selling price for customized production increased from RMB 4.26 per gram in 2016 to RMB 6.38 per gram in 2017, causing 49.8% increase. As a result, approximately $11.8 million increase in customized production revenue was affected by the increase in our selling price. The increase in branded and customized production sales was attributable to the Company's strengthened sales efforts and the increase in the market demand during the current year when market price of gold increased, which stimulated and inspired the customers to increase their investments on gold.\nWe produced 51.9 metric tons of customized gold products in fiscal 2017, increased by 40.7% from last year, while we produced 51.5 metric tons of branded gold products in fiscal 2017, representing an increase of 33.9% from last year.\nGold sales for the twelve months ended December 31,\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales/ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales/ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Metric </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Metric Ton </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Metric </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Metric Ton </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Tons </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ Million) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ Million) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Tons </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ Million) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ Million) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,009.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,420.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Branded </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,960.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,396.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Customized </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Others </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales\nCost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $1,809.8 million, an increase of $535.5 million, or 42% from $1,274.3 million for 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher volume of products sold in fiscal 2017, as well as the rising trend of gold cost in the market during fiscal 2017. The sale quantity increased 37.2% to approximately 103.4 metric tons in 2017 from 75.3 metric tons in 2016. In addition, the average cost of gold has increased due to the gold market price in 2017.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $199.9 million, an increase of $53.5 million or 37%, from $146.4 million for 2016. The increase in our gross profit resulted from the following factors: (1) Due to increased sales volume from 75.3 metric tons in 2016 to 103.4 metric tons in 2017, the Company's gross profit and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively affected. (2) The increased in unit selling price also impacted the gross margin.\nThe unit price of branded production sales was RMB 257.20 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2017, while the unit price of branded production sales was RMB 241.33 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016, the unit price increased by 6.6%. On the other hand, the unit cost of branded production was RMB 237.14 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2017, represented an increase of RMB 17.31 or 7.9% from RMB 219.83 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, the unit margin of branded production was RMB 20.06 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to RMB 21.50 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016. Higher proportional increase in unit cost than unit price for branded products led the slight decrease in gross profit margin.\nOur customized production sales volume increased from 36.9 metric tons in 2016 to 51.9 metric tons in 2017, and unit selling price in this segment increased from RMB 4.26 per gram in 2016 to RMB 6.38 per gram in 2017. The reason that the unit selling price of our customized production is significantly lower than the unit selling price of our branded production is in customized production, a customer supplies the Company with the raw materials and the Company creates products per that customer's instructions, whereas in branded production the Company generally purchases gold directly and manufactures and markets the products of its own.\nOur overall gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 9.9%, a slight decrease of 0.4% as compared to gross margin of 10.3% in 2016. The primary reason for the slight decrease in gross margin is due to higher proportional increase in unit cost than unit price for our branded production sales.\nExpenses\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $13.9 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 12%, from $12.4 million for 2016. The increase was mainly due to a $1.5 million increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses in 2017 was due to gold inventory insurance charges increased by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 comparing with the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in such expenses was in line with increase in purchases of gold inventory during the year and the increased inventory level as of December 31, 2017 comparing to December 31, 2016.\nOur provision for income tax expense was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $23.4 million, or 72%, from $32.6 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the net income before taxes from approximately $125.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from increased operating expenses as well as increased interest expenses of $78.3 million due to larger balance of loans maintained during the current year comparing with previous year.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income was approximately $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to other comprehensive loss of $76.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the unrealized gain related to investment in gold and the appreciation of RMB against the U.S. Dollar.\nNet Income\nFor the foregoing reasons, our net income was $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $66.7 million or 72% from $92.9 million for fiscal year 2016 as a result of the matters described above.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,420.6 million, an increase of $420.4 million, or 42%, from net sales of $1,000.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our branded production sales accounted for 98.3% of the total sales and customized production sales accounted for 1.7% of the total sales. When comparing with 2015, our branded production sales increased by $421.2 million or 43.2%, our customized production sales decreased by $0.65 million or 2.7%.\nThe overall increase in our revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the following combined factors: (1) total sales volume (in terms of quantity sold) increased from 56.5 metric tons in 2015 to 75.3 metric tons in 2016, causing 18.8 metric tons or 33.4% increase. As a result, approximately $331.8 million increase in our revenue was attributable to the increase in our sales volume. (2) The average unit selling price for branded production increased from RMB 210.45 per gram in 2015 to RMB 241.33 per gram in 2016, causing 14.7% increase. As a result, approximately $143.1 million increase in brand production revenue was affected by the increase in our selling price. The increase in branded production sales was attributable to the Company's strengthened sales efforts and the increase in the market demand during the 2016 when market price of gold increased, which stimulated and inspired the customers to increase their investments on gold. (3) Foreign currency adjustment effect was approximately $49.1 million foreign currency translation loss converting RMB into USD when the average exchange rate of USD: RMB increased from 1 USD=6.2288 RMB in 2015 to 1 USD=6.6441 RMB in 2016.\nWe produced 36.9 metric tons of customized gold products in fiscal 2016, increased by 33.6% from last year, while we produced 38.4 metric tons of branded gold products in fiscal 2016, representing an increase of 33.2% from last year.\nGold sales for the twelve months ended December 31,\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales/ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales/ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Metric </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Metric Ton </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Metric </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Metric Ton </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Tons </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ Million) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ Million) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Tons </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ Million) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ Million) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,420.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,000.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Branded </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,396.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>975.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Customized </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Others </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales\nCost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $1,274.3 million, an increase of $312.4 million, or 32.5% from $961.8 million for 2015.

As a result, the unit margin of branded production was RMB 21.50 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to RMB 3.46 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2015. Higher proportional increase in unit price than unit cost for branded products led the increase in gross profit as well as gross profit margin.\nOur customized production sales volume increased from 27.6 metric tons in 2015 to 36.9 metric tons in 2016, and unit selling price in this segment decreased from RMB 5.48 per gram in 2015 to RMB 4.26 per gram in 2016.

The primary reason for the substantial increase in gross margin is due to the increase of selling price per unit on our branded production sales.\nExpenses\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $12.4 million, an increase of $4.1 million or 49%, from $8.3 million for 2015. The increase was mainly due to a $4.3 million increase in the Selling, general and administrative expenses, and offset by a decrease of $0.29 million in the stock compensation expenses. The increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016 was due to increased expenses for gold inventory insurance and custody charges of approximately $3.45 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 comparing with the year ended December 31, 2015.

This restricted cash (along with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's personal credit) secures our obligations under our bank loans and gold lease agreements. We have financed our operations with cash flow generated from operations and through borrowing of bank loans as well as through private and public borrowings and offerings in the U.S. and Chinese capital markets, such as our placement under our commercial paper program with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ( SPD Bank\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had total outstanding loans of $2,626.7 million (including $962.1 million short-term loans, $875.2 million from a related parties and $789.4 million long-term loans). As of December 31, 2016, we had total outstanding loans of $1,949.1 million (including $234.7 million short-term loans, $28.8 million loan from a third party, $460.8 million from a related party and $1,224.8 million long-term loans), representing an increase of $677.6 million, or 34.8%.

For additional information regarding our loans, please refer to Notes 5, 9, and 10 in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe have maintained a close relationship with the banks from where we leased gold in the past. Therefore we expect that we are able to obtain additional gold leases from the banks, if necessary. We are expecting to generate additional cash flows in the coming period of time from developing new customers, expanding our sales through our online sales platform and an increase in our revenue in the following years due to the higher interest of inventing in gold to against the currency depreciation.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had positive working capital of $768.3 million and $459.9 million, respectively. We believe that our current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including our cash needs for working capital for the next 12 months. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends partially on our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue, while continuing to control costs. We continue to seek favorable additional financing to meet our capital requirements to fund our operations and growth plans in the ordinary course of business.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nOperating activities:\nWe used $25.7 million of net cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $74 million of net cash used in operating activities in 2016. The decrease of net cash used in operating was mainly due to the decrease in net income, increase in value added tax recoverable of $60.2 million, increase in inventories of $7.3 million for the increased production to meet our sales demand, offset by our increase in other payable and accrued expense of $4.1 million and increase in income tax payable of $4.7 million.\nWe used $74 million of net cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $62.5 million of net cash used in operating activities in 2015. The increase of net cash used in operating was mainly due to increase in net income of $71.3 million, increase in value added tax receivable of $270 million, decrease in customer deposit of $21.7 million, and decrease in income tax payable of $4.6 million, offset by our decrease in inventories of $173.8 million for the increased production to meet our sales demand, increase in other payable and accrued expense of $8.1 million, and the increase of net income of $71.3 million.\nWe used $62.5 million of net cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $20.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2014. The significant net cash used in operating was mainly due to the decrease of net income of $25.8 million and increase in our spending on purchase of inventory of $62.4 million when market price of gold was low.\nOur net cash from operating activities can fluctuate significantly due to changes in our inventories. Other factors that may vary significantly include our accounts payable, purchases of gold and income taxes. Looking forward, we expect the net cash that we generate from operating activities to continue to fluctuate as our inventories, receivables, accounts payables and the other factors described above change with increased production and the purchase of larger or smaller quantities of raw materials. These fluctuations could cause net cash from operating activities to decrease, even if our net income grows as we continue to expand. Although we expect that net cash from operating activities will increase over the long term, we cannot predict how these fluctuations will affect our cash flow in any particular accounting period.\nInvesting activities:\nWe used $553.2 million of net cash for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,763 million spent in 2016. The significant decrease in the net cash used in the investing activities was mainly because of we spent less on investments in gold which was approximately $552 million in connection with our significant borrowings, cash payment of $1.2 million related to the purchase of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe used $1,763 million of net cash for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $28 million spent in 2015. The significant increase in the net cash used in the investing activities was mainly because of the investments in gold of $1,913.5 million in connection with our significant borrowings, cash payment of $19.4 million related to the construction for the Jewelry Park, and offset by the cash received of $171.6 million related to the transfer of the Jewelry Park.\nWe used $28.0 million of net cash for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $35.8 million spent in 2014. The components of our cash used in investing activities for 2015 primarily included cash payment of $52.8 million to the construction company for the Jewelry Park construction work, plus $24.9 million construction payable to the construction company accrued during the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in the net cash used in the investing activities was mainly because of the cash payment we made to finance the construction of the Jewelry Park.\nWhile our net cash used in investing activities did not fluctuate much historically, we expect that cash used in investing activities will continue to fluctuate significantly in the short-term as we continue to obtain financing from the banks which may need to purchase more gold as collateral.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing activities:\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $560.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,856.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease net cash provided by the financing activities was mainly due to the fact that the Company repaid significant amount of bank loans, third party loans and related parties loans, but received less proceeds from various loans during the year, comparing to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1,856.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase net cash provided by the financing activities was mainly due to the fact that the Company utilized additional short term and long term bank loans, as well as the loans from two third parties and two related parties.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase net cash provided by the financing activities was mainly due to the fact that the Company utilized additional short term bank loans and issued a $62 million debt payable in fiscal 2015.\nWe expect that cash generated from financing activities may increase significantly as a result of additional financing being obtained to meet the needs of expanded production.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nForeign Currency Translations\nWe use the U.S. dollar as the reporting currency for our financial statements.

ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), which means it will be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)\u201d ( ASU 2016-08\u201d), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\u201d ( ASU 2016-10\u201d), which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients\u201d ( ASU 2016-12\u201d), which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. In December 2016, the FASB further issued ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2016-20\u201d), which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. The amendments are intended to address implementation and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard. These amendments have the same effective date as the new revenue standard. The Company's current revenue recognition policies are generally consistent with the new revenue recognition standards set forth in ASU 2014-09. Potential adjustments to input measures are not expected to be pervasive to the majority of the Company's contracts.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\". The amendments in this ASU clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. Basically these amendments provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business. If the screen is not met, the amendments in this ASU first, require that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and second, remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. These amendments take effect for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those periods. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05 ( ASU 2017-05\u201d) to provide guidance for recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of nonfinancial assets and in-substance nonfinancial assets in contracts with non-customers, unless other specific guidance applies. The standard requires a company to derecognize nonfinancial assets once it transfers control of a distinct nonfinancial asset or distinct in substance nonfinancial asset. Additionally, when a company transfers its controlling interest in a nonfinancial asset, but retains a noncontrolling ownership interest, the company is required to measure any noncontrolling interest it receives or retains at fair value. The guidance requires companies to recognize a full gain or loss on the transaction. As a result of the new guidance, the guidance specific to real estate sales in ASC 360-20 will be eliminated. ASU 2017-05 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The effective date of this guidance coincides with revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued ASU No. 2017-09 ( ASU 2017-09\u201d) to provide guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the changes in terms or conditions. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2017, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2017-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to the Staff Announcement at the July 20, 2017 EITF Meeting and Rescission of Prior SEC Staff Announcements and Observer Comments.\u201d The amendments in ASU No. 2017-13 amends the early adoption date option for certain companies related to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2016-02. The effective date is the same as the effective date and transition requirements for the amendments for ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-02. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\u201d The ASU amends ASC 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\u201d In addition, under the ASU, an entity will be required to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "Our financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars using the closing rate method.

The increase in our gross profit resulted from the following factors: (1) Due to increased sales volume from 75.3 metric tons in 2016 to 103.4 metric tons in 2017, the Company's gross profit and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively affected. (2) The increased in unit selling price also impacted the gross margin.\nOur net sales are primarily composed of sales of branded products to wholesale and retail customers, as well as fees generated from customized production. In customized production, a customer supplies the Company with the raw materials and the Company creates products per that customer's instructions, whereas in branded production the Company generally purchases gold directly and manufactures and markets the products on its own. The Company recognizes revenues under ASC 605 as follows:\nGross Profit, Gross Margin and Inventory Carrying Value\nThe following table sets forth information from our statements of income and comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 in U.S. dollars.\nNet Income\nIn February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05 ( ASU 2017-05\u201d) to provide guidance for recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of nonfinancial assets and in-substance nonfinancial assets in contracts with non-customers, unless other specific guidance applies. The standard requires a company to derecognize nonfinancial assets once it transfers control of a distinct nonfinancial asset or distinct in substance nonfinancial asset. Additionally, when a company transfers its controlling interest in a nonfinancial asset, but retains a noncontrolling ownership interest, the company is required to measure any noncontrolling interest it receives or retains at fair value. The guidance requires companies to recognize a full gain or loss on the transaction. As a result of the new guidance, the guidance specific to real estate sales in ASC 360-20 will be eliminated. ASU 2017-05 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The effective date of this guidance coincides with revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. While we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require significant judgments and estimates. For additional information relating to these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $5.0 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $21.3 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had $12.9 million in restricted cash compared to $60.3 million at December 31, 2016. This restricted cash (along with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's personal credit) secures our obligations under our bank loans and gold lease agreements. We have financed our operations with cash flow generated from operations and through borrowing of bank loans as well as through private and public borrowings and offerings in the U.S. and Chinese capital markets, such as our placement under our commercial paper program with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ( SPD Bank\u201d).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we guaranteed payments to two non-related parties of approximately $36 million (RMB 250 million) in bank loans, and also guaranteed payment for a related party of approximately $144 million (RMB 1,000 million) in bank loan.\nKey Components of Operating Results\n 48 \n\nAlthough the Chinese government has implemented measures to curb inflation, it is foreseeable that the Chinese economy may remain under inflationary pressure at least for the near term. It is difficult to estimate the impact of continued rise in inflation on us. On the one hand, inflation may lead to, among other things, higher operating expenses for us and erosion of our customers' purchases, adversely affecting our results. On the other hand, inflation may also make our products more attractive to Chinese consumers who traditionally have perceived gold as a safe haven investment from inflation.\nGross profit\nAccounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe used $1,763 million of net cash for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $28 million spent in 2015. The significant increase in the net cash used in the investing activities was mainly because of the investments in gold of $1,913.5 million in connection with our significant borrowings, cash payment of $19.4 million related to the construction for the Jewelry Park, and offset by the cash received of $171.6 million related to the transfer of the Jewelry Park.\nThe long-lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes. The recoverability value of an asset to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of such asset against the future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. Our principal long-lived assets are our property, plant and equipment assets.\nFinancing activities:\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $560.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,856.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease net cash provided by the financing activities was mainly due to the fact that the Company repaid significant amount of bank loans, third party loans and related parties loans, but received less proceeds from various loans during the year, comparing to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInvestments in Gold\nOur provision for income tax expense was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $23.4 million, or 72%, from $32.6 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the net income before taxes from approximately $125.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from increased operating expenses as well as increased interest expenses of $78.3 million due to larger balance of loans maintained during the current year comparing with previous year.\n 44 \nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015\nWe produced 51.9 metric tons of customized gold products in fiscal 2017, increased by 40.7% from last year, while we produced 51.5 metric tons of branded gold products in fiscal 2017, representing an increase of 33.9% from last year.\nIn September 2017, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2017-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to the Staff Announcement at the July 20, 2017 EITF Meeting and Rescission of Prior SEC Staff Announcements and Observer Comments.\u201d The amendments in ASU No. 2017-13 amends the early adoption date option for certain companies related to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2016-02. The effective date is the same as the effective date and transition requirements for the amendments for ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-02. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nOur provision for income tax expense was $32.63 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $26.29 million, or 415%, from $6.34 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in the net income before taxes from approximately $27.90 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $125.53 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from significant increased sales, gross profit offset by increased operating expenses as well as increased interest expenses of $72.2 million during the current year comparing with previous year.\nThe carrying value of all current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. We determined that the carrying value of the long term loans approximated their fair value by comparing the stated loan interest rate to the rate charged by similar financial institutions. We use quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of investments in gold.\nWe use the U.S. dollar as the reporting currency for our financial statements. Our operations are conducted through our PRC operating subsidiary, Vogue-Show, and our functional currency is the Renminbi ( RMB\u201d). Foreign currency transactions during the year are translated to the RMB at the approximate rates of exchange on the dates of transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies on the balance sheet are translated at the approximate rates of exchange at the respective balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time that the asset or liability was acquired. Exchange gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $146.4 million, an increase of $108.1 million or 282%, from $38.3 million for 2015. The increase in our gross profit resulted from the following factors: (1) Due to increased sales volume from 56.5 metric tons in 2015 to 75.3 metric tons in 2016, the Company's gross profit and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 was positively affected. (2) The increased in unit selling price also impacted the gross margin:\nOther Comprehensive Loss\nWe have developed our investments in gold as a business. We sell our investment gold products through banks. Similar to our jewelry business, pricing of our investment gold products is made at the time of sale based upon the then-current price of gold, and sales are made on a cash or credit on delivery basis.\nCustomized production fees\nWe used $28.0 million of net cash for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $35.8 million spent in 2014. The components of our cash used in investing activities for 2015 primarily included cash payment of $52.8 million to the construction company for the Jewelry Park construction work, plus $24.9 million construction payable to the construction company accrued during the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in the net cash used in the investing activities was mainly because of the cash payment we made to finance the construction of the Jewelry Park.\nInflation\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n 47 \n 54 \n 50 \nThe exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into U.S. dollars for the purposes of preparing the financial statements were as follows:\nWe derive our revenue almost entirely from the sales of 24-karat jewelry and Chinese ornaments and from design and processing fees we receive from other jewelry companies who hire us to design and produce 24-karat jewelry and Chinese ornaments using gold they supply us. We offer a wide range of in-house designed products including but not limited to gold necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, and pendants. In our jewelry business, we only sell on a wholesale basis to distributors and retailers. Pricing of our jewelry business products is made at the time of sale based upon the then- current price of gold and sales are made on a cash or credit on delivery basis.\nFor the foregoing reasons, our net income was $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $71.3 million or 331% from fiscal 2015 as a result of the matters described above.\nGross profit\nIn May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued ASU No. 2017-09 ( ASU 2017-09\u201d) to provide guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the changes in terms or conditions. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nObligations and Commitments\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value . Cost is determined using the weighted average method. We continually evaluate the composition of our inventory, turnover of our products, the price of gold and the ability of our customers to pay for their products. We write down slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on assessment of these factors, but principally customer demand. Such assessments require the exercise of significant judgment by management. Additionally, the value of our inventory may be affected by commodity prices. Decreases in the market value of gold would result in a lower stated value of our inventory, which may require us to take a charge for the decrease in the value. In addition, if the price of gold changes substantially in a very short period, it might trigger customer defaults, which could result in inventory obsolescence. If any of these factors were to become less favorable than those projected, inventory write-downs could be required, which would have a negative effect on our earnings and working capital.\n 43 \nOther comprehensive loss was approximately $76.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to other comprehensive loss of $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the unrealized loss related to investment in gold and the depreciation of RMB against the U.S. Dollar.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we guaranteed payments for a non-related party of approximately $30.7 million (RMB 200 million) in bank loans. On April 12, 2017, the bank loans were repaid upon maturity.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n 46 \nThe overall increase in our revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to the following combined factors: (1) total sales volume (in terms of quantity sold) increased from 75.3 metric tons in 2016 to 103.4 metric tons in 2017, causing 28.1 metric tons or 37.2% increase. As a result, approximately $483.8 million increase in our revenue was attributable to the increase in our sales volume. (2) The average unit selling price for branded production increased from RMB 241.33 per gram in 2016 to RMB 257.20 per gram in 2017, causing 6.6% increase. As a result, approximately $91.9 million increase in brand production revenue was affected by the increase in our selling price. (3) The average unit selling price for customized production increased from RMB 4.26 per gram in 2016 to RMB 6.38 per gram in 2017, causing 49.8% increase. As a result, approximately $11.8 million increase in customized production revenue was affected by the increase in our selling price. The increase in branded and customized production sales was attributable to the Company's strengthened sales efforts and the increase in the market demand during the current year when market price of gold increased, which stimulated and inspired the customers to increase their investments on gold.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), which means it will be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)\u201d ( ASU 2016-08\u201d), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\u201d ( ASU 2016-10\u201d), which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients\u201d ( ASU 2016-12\u201d), which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. In December 2016, the FASB further issued ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2016-20\u201d), which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. The amendments are intended to address implementation and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard. These amendments have the same effective date as the new revenue standard. The Company's current revenue recognition policies are generally consistent with the new revenue recognition standards set forth in ASU 2014-09. Potential adjustments to input measures are not expected to be pervasive to the majority of the Company's contracts.\nWe follow the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nOur overall gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 9.9%, a slight decrease of 0.4% as compared to gross margin of 10.3% in 2016. The primary reason for the slight decrease in gross margin is due to higher proportional increase in unit cost than unit price for our branded production sales.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $13.9 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 12%, from $12.4 million for 2016. The increase was mainly due to a $1.5 million increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses in 2017 was due to gold inventory insurance charges increased by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 comparing with the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in such expenses was in line with increase in purchases of gold inventory during the year and the increased inventory level as of December 31, 2017 comparing to December 31, 2016.\nWe produced 36.9 metric tons of customized gold products in fiscal 2016, increased by 33.6% from last year, while we produced 38.4 metric tons of branded gold products in fiscal 2016, representing an increase of 33.2% from last year.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSales of branded products\nThe unit price of branded production sales was RMB 241.33 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016, while the unit price of branded production sales was RMB 210.45 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2015, the unit price increased by 14.7%. On the other hand, the unit cost of branded production was RMB 219.83 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016, represented an increase of RMB 12.84 or 6.2% from RMB 206.99 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, the unit margin of branded production was RMB 21.50 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to RMB 3.46 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2015. Higher proportional increase in unit price than unit cost for branded products led the increase in gross profit as well as gross profit margin.\nWe used $74 million of net cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $62.5 million of net cash used in operating activities in 2015. The increase of net cash used in operating was mainly due to increase in net income of $71.3 million, increase in value added tax receivable of $270 million, decrease in customer deposit of $21.7 million, and decrease in income tax payable of $4.6 million, offset by our decrease in inventories of $173.8 million for the increased production to meet our sales demand, increase in other payable and accrued expense of $8.1 million, and the increase of net income of $71.3 million.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $12.4 million, an increase of $4.1 million or 49%, from $8.3 million for 2015. The increase was mainly due to a $4.3 million increase in the Selling, general and administrative expenses, and offset by a decrease of $0.29 million in the stock compensation expenses. The increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016 was due to increased expenses for gold inventory insurance and custody charges of approximately $3.45 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 comparing with the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in such expenses was in line with increase in purchases of gold inventory during the year 2016 and the increased inventory level as of December 31, 2016 comparing to December 31, 2015.\n (3) Represents the outstanding principal balance of loans from related parties. \nIf the value of such an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less disposition costs. No events or changes in our business or circumstances required us to test for impairment of our long-lived assets during 2016 and 2015, and accordingly, we did not recognize any impairment loss during these periods.\n 45 \nOur gross profit margin and profitability as well as the carrying value of our inventory are affected by changes in the price of gold. If there is an increase in the price of gold that increases our production costs beyond the amount we may be able to pass to our customers, it has a negative effect on our gross margin and profitability. Furthermore, the carrying value of our inventory may be affected if the price of gold decreases relative to the price that we paid for that inventory. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately 3.7 and 3.5 metric tons of gold in our inventory for production, all of which had been sold in excess of the carrying value by the date of this report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInventories\nThe following discussion \u03b1nd \u03b1n\u03b1lysis of the consolid\u03b1ted fin\u03b1nci\u03b1l condition \u03b1nd results of oper\u03b1tions should be re\u03b1d in conjunction with our consolid\u03b1ted fin\u03b1nci\u03b1l st\u03b1tements \u03b1nd rel\u03b1ted notes \u03b1ppe\u03b1ring elsewhere.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nCost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $1,274.3 million, an increase of $312.4 million, or 32.5% from $961.8 million for 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher volume of products sold in fiscal 2016, as well as the rising trend of gold cost in the market during fiscal 2016. The sale quantity increase 33.4% to approximately 75.3 metric tons in 2016 from 56.5 metric tons in 2015. In addition, the average cost of gold has increased due to the gold market price in 2016.\nSources of Revenue\nNet Income\nKINGOLD JEWELRY, INC.\n 56 \nWe used $62.5 million of net cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $20.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2014. The significant net cash used in operating was mainly due to the decrease of net income of $25.8 million and increase in our spending on purchase of inventory of $62.4 million when market price of gold was low.\nThe unit price of branded production sales was RMB 257.20 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2017, while the unit price of branded production sales was RMB 241.33 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016, the unit price increased by 6.6%. On the other hand, the unit cost of branded production was RMB 237.14 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2017, represented an increase of RMB 17.31 or 7.9% from RMB 219.83 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, the unit margin of branded production was RMB 20.06 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to RMB 21.50 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016. Higher proportional increase in unit cost than unit price for branded products led the slight decrease in gross profit margin.\nWe used $553.2 million of net cash for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,763 million spent in 2016. The significant decrease in the net cash used in the investing activities was mainly because of we spent less on investments in gold which was approximately $552 million in connection with our significant borrowings, cash payment of $1.2 million related to the purchase of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe used $25.7 million of net cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $74 million of net cash used in operating activities in 2016. The decrease of net cash used in operating was mainly due to the decrease in net income, increase in value added tax recoverable of $60.2 million, increase in inventories of $7.3 million for the increased production to meet our sales demand, offset by our increase in other payable and accrued expense of $4.1 million and increase in income tax payable of $4.7 million.\nWhile our net cash used in investing activities did not fluctuate much historically, we expect that cash used in investing activities will continue to fluctuate significantly in the short-term as we continue to obtain financing from the banks which may need to purchase more gold as collateral.\nOur customized production sales volume increased from 36.9 metric tons in 2016 to 51.9 metric tons in 2017, and unit selling price in this segment increased from RMB 4.26 per gram in 2016 to RMB 6.38 per gram in 2017. The reason that the unit selling price of our customized production is significantly lower than the unit selling price of our branded production is in customized production, a customer supplies the Company with the raw materials and the Company creates products per that customer's instructions, whereas in branded production the Company generally purchases gold directly and manufactures and markets the products of its own.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income (loss). The unrealized gain or loss resulting from the change of the fair market value and the foreign currency translation gain or loss resulting from translation of the financial statements expressed in RMB to US$ are reported in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and the consolidated statements of changes in equity and is net of tax.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had total outstanding loans of $2,626.7 million (including $962.1 million short-term loans, $875.2 million from a related parties and $789.4 million long-term loans). As of December 31, 2016, we had total outstanding loans of $1,949.1 million (including $234.7 million short-term loans, $28.8 million loan from a third party, $460.8 million from a related party and $1,224.8 million long-term loans), representing an increase of $677.6 million, or 34.8%. The amounts outstanding under these loans are presented in our financial statements as loans\u201d; the amounts outstanding under the third party loans are presented in our financial statements as Third Party Loans\u201d, and the amounts outstanding under the related party loan are presented in our financial statements as Related Party Loan\u201d. For additional information regarding our loans, please refer to Notes 5, 9, and 10 in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCost of sales\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1,856.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase net cash provided by the financing activities was mainly due to the fact that the Company utilized additional short term and long term bank loans, as well as the loans from two third parties and two related parties.\n 42 \nOur overall gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 10.3%, an increase of 6.5% as compared to gross margin of 3.8% in 2015. The primary reason for the substantial increase in gross margin is due to the increase of selling price per unit on our branded production sales.\nOther comprehensive income was approximately $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to other comprehensive loss of $76.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the unrealized gain related to investment in gold and the appreciation of RMB against the U.S. Dollar.\nWe must make various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets. We use set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management, and estimate the fair value of our reporting units by using undiscounted cash flow analyses. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for the underlying assets at such time. Any such resulting impairment charges could be material to our results of operations.\nOur cost of sales consists principally of the cost for raw materials, primarily gold. We generally purchase gold directly from the Shanghai Gold Exchange, of which we are a member. We lease gold from leading commercial banks in China to increase our gold supply and fuel our growth. We generally do not enter into long term purchase agreements for gold. During recent years, the price of gold on the international gold market has experienced periods of significant fluctuation. We have been attempting to offset gold price fluctuations by locking in the price at the time an order is placed, as well as passing on the price to purchasers.\n 49 \n 51 \n (2) Represents the outstanding principal balance of short-term loans from bank and financial institutions. \nAs of December 31, 2016, two non-related parties repaid approximately $7.2 million (RMB 50 million) in bank loans, and a related party repaid approximately $144 million (RMB 1,000 million) in bank loan, with the outstanding guarantee payment of approximately $28.8 million (RMB 200 million) for a non-related party in bank loans.\nTotal translation gain recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $22,752,426. Total translation loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $21,461,689. Total translation loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $14,740,716.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nThe Company recognizes services-based revenue (the processing fee) from such contracts for customized production when: (i) the contracted services have been performed and (ii) collectability is deemed probable.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,420.6 million, an increase of $420.4 million, or 42%, from net sales of $1,000.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our branded production sales accounted for 98.3% of the total sales and customized production sales accounted for 1.7% of the total sales. When comparing with 2015, our branded production sales increased by $421.2 million or 43.2%, our customized production sales decreased by $0.65 million or 2.7%.\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\n 53 \nCost of Sales\nOur customized production sales volume increased from 27.6 metric tons in 2015 to 36.9 metric tons in 2016, and unit selling price in this segment decreased from RMB 5.48 per gram in 2015 to RMB 4.26 per gram in 2016. The reason that the unit selling price of our customized production is much lower than the unit selling price of our branded production is in customized production, a customer supplies the Company with the raw materials and the Company creates products per that customer's instructions, whereas in branded production the Company generally purchases gold directly and manufactures and markets the products of its own.\nOperating activities:\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of RMB may materially affect our financial condition in terms of U.S. dollar reporting.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect management's assumptions based on the best available information.\nWe expect that cash generated from financing activities may increase significantly as a result of additional financing being obtained to meet the needs of expanded production.\nForeign Currency Translations\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016\n 55 \nGold sales for the twelve months ended December 31,\nExpenses\nThe FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\u201d The ASU amends ASC 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\u201d In addition, under the ASU, an entity will be required to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nWe have maintained a close relationship with the banks from where we leased gold in the past. Therefore we expect that we are able to obtain additional gold leases from the banks, if necessary. We are expecting to generate additional cash flows in the coming period of time from developing new customers, expanding our sales through our online sales platform and an increase in our revenue in the following years due to the higher interest of inventing in gold to against the currency depreciation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\". The amendments in this ASU clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. Basically these amendments provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business. If the screen is not met, the amendments in this ASU first, require that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and second, remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. These amendments take effect for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those periods. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had positive working capital of $768.3 million and $459.9 million, respectively. We believe that our current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including our cash needs for working capital for the next 12 months. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends partially on our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue, while continuing to control costs. We continue to seek favorable additional financing to meet our capital requirements to fund our operations and growth plans in the ordinary course of business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we also guaranteed payment for a related party of approximately $307.4 million (RMB 2,000 million) for two bank loans. The loans were repaid upon maturity in January 2018 and February 2018, respectively.\nGold sales for the twelve months ended December 31,\nNo representation is made that RMB amounts have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars at the above rates or at all. Although Chinese government regulations now allow convertibility of RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain. Hence, such translations should not be construed as representations that RMB can be converted into U.S. dollars at the above conversion rate, or any other rate.\nResults of Operations\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\n(IN U.S. DOLLARS)\nCost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $1,809.8 million, an increase of $535.5 million, or 42% from $1,274.3 million for 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher volume of products sold in fiscal 2017, as well as the rising trend of gold cost in the market during fiscal 2017. The sale quantity increased 37.2% to approximately 103.4 metric tons in 2017 from 75.3 metric tons in 2016. In addition, the average cost of gold has increased due to the gold market price in 2017.\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nCompetitive pricing pressure and changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our long-lived assets, and thus could result in future impairment losses.\nInvesting activities:\nThe overall increase in our revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the following combined factors: (1) total sales volume (in terms of quantity sold) increased from 56.5 metric tons in 2015 to 75.3 metric tons in 2016, causing 18.8 metric tons or 33.4% increase. As a result, approximately $331.8 million increase in our revenue was attributable to the increase in our sales volume. (2) The average unit selling price for branded production increased from RMB 210.45 per gram in 2015 to RMB 241.33 per gram in 2016, causing 14.7% increase. As a result, approximately $143.1 million increase in brand production revenue was affected by the increase in our selling price. The increase in branded production sales was attributable to the Company's strengthened sales efforts and the increase in the market demand during the 2016 when market price of gold increased, which stimulated and inspired the customers to increase their investments on gold. (3) Foreign currency adjustment effect was approximately $49.1 million foreign currency translation loss converting RMB into USD when the average exchange rate of USD: RMB increased from 1 USD=6.2288 RMB in 2015 to 1 USD=6.6441 RMB in 2016.\n (1) Represents the outstanding principal balance of long-term loans from bank and financial institutions. \nCash Flow for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nExpenses\nThe Company recognizes revenue on sales of branded products when the goods are delivered and title to the goods passes to the customer provided that: there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the sales price is fixed and determinable; and collectability is deemed probable.\nOur net cash from operating activities can fluctuate significantly due to changes in our inventories. Other factors that may vary significantly include our accounts payable, purchases of gold and income taxes. Looking forward, we expect the net cash that we generate from operating activities to continue to fluctuate as our inventories, receivables, accounts payables and the other factors described above change with increased production and the purchase of larger or smaller quantities of raw materials. These fluctuations could cause net cash from operating activities to decrease, even if our net income grows as we continue to expand. Although we expect that net cash from operating activities will increase over the long term, we cannot predict how these fluctuations will affect our cash flow in any particular accounting period.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2,009.7 million, an increase of $589.1 million, or 41%, from net sales of $1,420.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our branded production sales accounted for 97.6% of the total sales and customized production sales accounted for 2.4% of the total sales. When comparing with 2016, our branded production sales increased by $563.8 million or 40.4%, our customized production sales increased by $25.3 million or 107.2%.\n 41 \nWe pledged the gold leased from related party and part of our own gold inventory to meet the requirements of bank loans. The pledged gold will be available for sale upon the repayment of the bank loans. We classified these pledged gold as investments in gold, and carried at fair market value, with the unrealized gains and losses, included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in shareholders' equity. The fair market value of the investments in gold is determined by quoted market prices at Shanghai Gold Exchange. Since the investments in gold are pledged for the bank loans, any material decrease in market value may negatively impact the loan covenants.\nNet Sales", "item_7_text": "Our financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars using the closing rate method. The balance sheet items are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the respective balance sheet dates. The capital and various reserves are translated at historical exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transactions while income and expenses items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. All gains and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange are recorded within equity.\n (4) On June 27, 2016, Wuhan Kingold signed certain 5 years lease agreements with Wuhan Huayuan, a related party which is controlled by the CEO and Chairman of the Company, to rent office and store space at the Jewelry Park, commencing in July 2016 and October 2016, respectively, with aggregate annual rent of approximately $0.3 million (RMB 2.3 million). On July 1, 2017, Wuhan Kingold signed another 5 years lease agreement with Wuhan Huayuan to rent additional office space at the Jewelry Park commencing in July 2017 with aggregate annual rent of approximately $85,245 (RMB 576,000). The lease agreement with Wuhan Huayuan has been amended on November 16, 2017, pursuant to which two office spaces and a dormitory were no longer leased. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $211,692, $132,600 and $Nil rent expenses, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had lease payable to Wuhan Huayuan of $263,740, which included in other payables and accrued expenses. \nOn December 14, 2016, Wuhan Kingold transferred its 55% ownership interest in Kingold Internet to Wuhan Kingold Industrial Group Co., Ltd., a related party, for a consideration of $79,196 (RMB 550,000). After the transfer, Kingold Internet and Yuhuang were no longer the subsidiaries of Wuhan Kingold. Our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Kingold, Dragon Lead, Wuhan Vogue-Show and Wuhan Kingold. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase net cash provided by the financing activities was mainly due to the fact that the Company utilized additional short term bank loans and issued a $62 million debt payable in fiscal 2015.\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2015\nForward-Looking Information\nFor the foregoing reasons, our net income was $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $66.7 million or 72% from $92.9 million for fiscal year 2016 as a result of the matters described above.\nNet Sales\nCost of sales\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no leased gold outstanding. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, 185 kilograms and 2,782 kilograms of leased gold were outstanding, at the approximated amounts of $7.2 million and $101.8 million, respectively. The Company may sign new gold lease agreements with the banks when necessary.\n\n 52 \nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $199.9 million, an increase of $53.5 million or 37%, from $146.4 million for 2016. The increase in our gross profit resulted from the following factors: (1) Due to increased sales volume from 75.3 metric tons in 2016 to 103.4 metric tons in 2017, the Company's gross profit and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively affected. (2) The increased in unit selling price also impacted the gross margin.\nOur net sales are primarily composed of sales of branded products to wholesale and retail customers, as well as fees generated from customized production. In customized production, a customer supplies the Company with the raw materials and the Company creates products per that customer's instructions, whereas in branded production the Company generally purchases gold directly and manufactures and markets the products on its own. The Company recognizes revenues under ASC 605 as follows:\nGross Profit, Gross Margin and Inventory Carrying Value\nThe following table sets forth information from our statements of income and comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 in U.S. dollars.\nNet Income\nIn February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05 ( ASU 2017-05\u201d) to provide guidance for recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of nonfinancial assets and in-substance nonfinancial assets in contracts with non-customers, unless other specific guidance applies. The standard requires a company to derecognize nonfinancial assets once it transfers control of a distinct nonfinancial asset or distinct in substance nonfinancial asset. Additionally, when a company transfers its controlling interest in a nonfinancial asset, but retains a noncontrolling ownership interest, the company is required to measure any noncontrolling interest it receives or retains at fair value. The guidance requires companies to recognize a full gain or loss on the transaction. As a result of the new guidance, the guidance specific to real estate sales in ASC 360-20 will be eliminated. ASU 2017-05 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The effective date of this guidance coincides with revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. While we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require significant judgments and estimates. For additional information relating to these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $5.0 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $21.3 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had $12.9 million in restricted cash compared to $60.3 million at December 31, 2016. This restricted cash (along with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's personal credit) secures our obligations under our bank loans and gold lease agreements. We have financed our operations with cash flow generated from operations and through borrowing of bank loans as well as through private and public borrowings and offerings in the U.S. and Chinese capital markets, such as our placement under our commercial paper program with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ( SPD Bank\u201d).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we guaranteed payments to two non-related parties of approximately $36 million (RMB 250 million) in bank loans, and also guaranteed payment for a related party of approximately $144 million (RMB 1,000 million) in bank loan.\nKey Components of Operating Results\n 48 \n\nAlthough the Chinese government has implemented measures to curb inflation, it is foreseeable that the Chinese economy may remain under inflationary pressure at least for the near term. It is difficult to estimate the impact of continued rise in inflation on us. On the one hand, inflation may lead to, among other things, higher operating expenses for us and erosion of our customers' purchases, adversely affecting our results. On the other hand, inflation may also make our products more attractive to Chinese consumers who traditionally have perceived gold as a safe haven investment from inflation.\nGross profit\nAccounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe used $1,763 million of net cash for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $28 million spent in 2015. The significant increase in the net cash used in the investing activities was mainly because of the investments in gold of $1,913.5 million in connection with our significant borrowings, cash payment of $19.4 million related to the construction for the Jewelry Park, and offset by the cash received of $171.6 million related to the transfer of the Jewelry Park.\nThe long-lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes. The recoverability value of an asset to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of such asset against the future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. Our principal long-lived assets are our property, plant and equipment assets.\nFinancing activities:\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $560.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,856.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease net cash provided by the financing activities was mainly due to the fact that the Company repaid significant amount of bank loans, third party loans and related parties loans, but received less proceeds from various loans during the year, comparing to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInvestments in Gold\nOur provision for income tax expense was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $23.4 million, or 72%, from $32.6 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the net income before taxes from approximately $125.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from increased operating expenses as well as increased interest expenses of $78.3 million due to larger balance of loans maintained during the current year comparing with previous year.\n 44 \nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015\nWe produced 51.9 metric tons of customized gold products in fiscal 2017, increased by 40.7% from last year, while we produced 51.5 metric tons of branded gold products in fiscal 2017, representing an increase of 33.9% from last year.\nIn September 2017, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2017-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to the Staff Announcement at the July 20, 2017 EITF Meeting and Rescission of Prior SEC Staff Announcements and Observer Comments.\u201d The amendments in ASU No. 2017-13 amends the early adoption date option for certain companies related to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2016-02. The effective date is the same as the effective date and transition requirements for the amendments for ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-02. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nOur provision for income tax expense was $32.63 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $26.29 million, or 415%, from $6.34 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in the net income before taxes from approximately $27.90 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $125.53 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from significant increased sales, gross profit offset by increased operating expenses as well as increased interest expenses of $72.2 million during the current year comparing with previous year.\nThe carrying value of all current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. We determined that the carrying value of the long term loans approximated their fair value by comparing the stated loan interest rate to the rate charged by similar financial institutions. We use quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of investments in gold.\nWe use the U.S. dollar as the reporting currency for our financial statements. Our operations are conducted through our PRC operating subsidiary, Vogue-Show, and our functional currency is the Renminbi ( RMB\u201d). Foreign currency transactions during the year are translated to the RMB at the approximate rates of exchange on the dates of transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies on the balance sheet are translated at the approximate rates of exchange at the respective balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time that the asset or liability was acquired. Exchange gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $146.4 million, an increase of $108.1 million or 282%, from $38.3 million for 2015. The increase in our gross profit resulted from the following factors: (1) Due to increased sales volume from 56.5 metric tons in 2015 to 75.3 metric tons in 2016, the Company's gross profit and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 was positively affected. (2) The increased in unit selling price also impacted the gross margin:\nOther Comprehensive Loss\nWe have developed our investments in gold as a business. We sell our investment gold products through banks. Similar to our jewelry business, pricing of our investment gold products is made at the time of sale based upon the then-current price of gold, and sales are made on a cash or credit on delivery basis.\nCustomized production fees\nWe used $28.0 million of net cash for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $35.8 million spent in 2014. The components of our cash used in investing activities for 2015 primarily included cash payment of $52.8 million to the construction company for the Jewelry Park construction work, plus $24.9 million construction payable to the construction company accrued during the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in the net cash used in the investing activities was mainly because of the cash payment we made to finance the construction of the Jewelry Park.\nInflation\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n 47 \n 54 \n 50 \nThe exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into U.S. dollars for the purposes of preparing the financial statements were as follows:\nWe derive our revenue almost entirely from the sales of 24-karat jewelry and Chinese ornaments and from design and processing fees we receive from other jewelry companies who hire us to design and produce 24-karat jewelry and Chinese ornaments using gold they supply us. We offer a wide range of in-house designed products including but not limited to gold necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, and pendants. In our jewelry business, we only sell on a wholesale basis to distributors and retailers. Pricing of our jewelry business products is made at the time of sale based upon the then- current price of gold and sales are made on a cash or credit on delivery basis.\nFor the foregoing reasons, our net income was $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $71.3 million or 331% from fiscal 2015 as a result of the matters described above.\nGross profit\nIn May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued ASU No. 2017-09 ( ASU 2017-09\u201d) to provide guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the changes in terms or conditions. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nObligations and Commitments\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value . Cost is determined using the weighted average method. We continually evaluate the composition of our inventory, turnover of our products, the price of gold and the ability of our customers to pay for their products. We write down slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on assessment of these factors, but principally customer demand. Such assessments require the exercise of significant judgment by management. Additionally, the value of our inventory may be affected by commodity prices. Decreases in the market value of gold would result in a lower stated value of our inventory, which may require us to take a charge for the decrease in the value. In addition, if the price of gold changes substantially in a very short period, it might trigger customer defaults, which could result in inventory obsolescence. If any of these factors were to become less favorable than those projected, inventory write-downs could be required, which would have a negative effect on our earnings and working capital.\n 43 \nOther comprehensive loss was approximately $76.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to other comprehensive loss of $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the unrealized loss related to investment in gold and the depreciation of RMB against the U.S. Dollar.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we guaranteed payments for a non-related party of approximately $30.7 million (RMB 200 million) in bank loans. On April 12, 2017, the bank loans were repaid upon maturity.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n 46 \nThe overall increase in our revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to the following combined factors: (1) total sales volume (in terms of quantity sold) increased from 75.3 metric tons in 2016 to 103.4 metric tons in 2017, causing 28.1 metric tons or 37.2% increase. As a result, approximately $483.8 million increase in our revenue was attributable to the increase in our sales volume. (2) The average unit selling price for branded production increased from RMB 241.33 per gram in 2016 to RMB 257.20 per gram in 2017, causing 6.6% increase. As a result, approximately $91.9 million increase in brand production revenue was affected by the increase in our selling price. (3) The average unit selling price for customized production increased from RMB 4.26 per gram in 2016 to RMB 6.38 per gram in 2017, causing 49.8% increase. As a result, approximately $11.8 million increase in customized production revenue was affected by the increase in our selling price. The increase in branded and customized production sales was attributable to the Company's strengthened sales efforts and the increase in the market demand during the current year when market price of gold increased, which stimulated and inspired the customers to increase their investments on gold.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), which means it will be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)\u201d ( ASU 2016-08\u201d), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\u201d ( ASU 2016-10\u201d), which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients\u201d ( ASU 2016-12\u201d), which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. In December 2016, the FASB further issued ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2016-20\u201d), which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. The amendments are intended to address implementation and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard. These amendments have the same effective date as the new revenue standard. The Company's current revenue recognition policies are generally consistent with the new revenue recognition standards set forth in ASU 2014-09. Potential adjustments to input measures are not expected to be pervasive to the majority of the Company's contracts.\nWe follow the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nOur overall gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 9.9%, a slight decrease of 0.4% as compared to gross margin of 10.3% in 2016. The primary reason for the slight decrease in gross margin is due to higher proportional increase in unit cost than unit price for our branded production sales.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $13.9 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 12%, from $12.4 million for 2016. The increase was mainly due to a $1.5 million increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses in 2017 was due to gold inventory insurance charges increased by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 comparing with the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in such expenses was in line with increase in purchases of gold inventory during the year and the increased inventory level as of December 31, 2017 comparing to December 31, 2016.\nWe produced 36.9 metric tons of customized gold products in fiscal 2016, increased by 33.6% from last year, while we produced 38.4 metric tons of branded gold products in fiscal 2016, representing an increase of 33.2% from last year.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSales of branded products\nThe unit price of branded production sales was RMB 241.33 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016, while the unit price of branded production sales was RMB 210.45 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2015, the unit price increased by 14.7%. On the other hand, the unit cost of branded production was RMB 219.83 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016, represented an increase of RMB 12.84 or 6.2% from RMB 206.99 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, the unit margin of branded production was RMB 21.50 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to RMB 3.46 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2015. Higher proportional increase in unit price than unit cost for branded products led the increase in gross profit as well as gross profit margin.\nWe used $74 million of net cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $62.5 million of net cash used in operating activities in 2015. The increase of net cash used in operating was mainly due to increase in net income of $71.3 million, increase in value added tax receivable of $270 million, decrease in customer deposit of $21.7 million, and decrease in income tax payable of $4.6 million, offset by our decrease in inventories of $173.8 million for the increased production to meet our sales demand, increase in other payable and accrued expense of $8.1 million, and the increase of net income of $71.3 million.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $12.4 million, an increase of $4.1 million or 49%, from $8.3 million for 2015. The increase was mainly due to a $4.3 million increase in the Selling, general and administrative expenses, and offset by a decrease of $0.29 million in the stock compensation expenses. The increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016 was due to increased expenses for gold inventory insurance and custody charges of approximately $3.45 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 comparing with the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in such expenses was in line with increase in purchases of gold inventory during the year 2016 and the increased inventory level as of December 31, 2016 comparing to December 31, 2015.\n (3) Represents the outstanding principal balance of loans from related parties. \nIf the value of such an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less disposition costs. No events or changes in our business or circumstances required us to test for impairment of our long-lived assets during 2016 and 2015, and accordingly, we did not recognize any impairment loss during these periods.\n 45 \nOur gross profit margin and profitability as well as the carrying value of our inventory are affected by changes in the price of gold. If there is an increase in the price of gold that increases our production costs beyond the amount we may be able to pass to our customers, it has a negative effect on our gross margin and profitability. Furthermore, the carrying value of our inventory may be affected if the price of gold decreases relative to the price that we paid for that inventory. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately 3.7 and 3.5 metric tons of gold in our inventory for production, all of which had been sold in excess of the carrying value by the date of this report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInventories\nThe following discussion \u03b1nd \u03b1n\u03b1lysis of the consolid\u03b1ted fin\u03b1nci\u03b1l condition \u03b1nd results of oper\u03b1tions should be re\u03b1d in conjunction with our consolid\u03b1ted fin\u03b1nci\u03b1l st\u03b1tements \u03b1nd rel\u03b1ted notes \u03b1ppe\u03b1ring elsewhere.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nCost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $1,274.3 million, an increase of $312.4 million, or 32.5% from $961.8 million for 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher volume of products sold in fiscal 2016, as well as the rising trend of gold cost in the market during fiscal 2016. The sale quantity increase 33.4% to approximately 75.3 metric tons in 2016 from 56.5 metric tons in 2015. In addition, the average cost of gold has increased due to the gold market price in 2016.\nSources of Revenue\nNet Income\nKINGOLD JEWELRY, INC.\n 56 \nWe used $62.5 million of net cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $20.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2014. The significant net cash used in operating was mainly due to the decrease of net income of $25.8 million and increase in our spending on purchase of inventory of $62.4 million when market price of gold was low.\nThe unit price of branded production sales was RMB 257.20 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2017, while the unit price of branded production sales was RMB 241.33 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016, the unit price increased by 6.6%. On the other hand, the unit cost of branded production was RMB 237.14 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2017, represented an increase of RMB 17.31 or 7.9% from RMB 219.83 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, the unit margin of branded production was RMB 20.06 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to RMB 21.50 per gram for the year ended December 31, 2016. Higher proportional increase in unit cost than unit price for branded products led the slight decrease in gross profit margin.\nWe used $553.2 million of net cash for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,763 million spent in 2016. The significant decrease in the net cash used in the investing activities was mainly because of we spent less on investments in gold which was approximately $552 million in connection with our significant borrowings, cash payment of $1.2 million related to the purchase of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe used $25.7 million of net cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $74 million of net cash used in operating activities in 2016. The decrease of net cash used in operating was mainly due to the decrease in net income, increase in value added tax recoverable of $60.2 million, increase in inventories of $7.3 million for the increased production to meet our sales demand, offset by our increase in other payable and accrued expense of $4.1 million and increase in income tax payable of $4.7 million.\nWhile our net cash used in investing activities did not fluctuate much historically, we expect that cash used in investing activities will continue to fluctuate significantly in the short-term as we continue to obtain financing from the banks which may need to purchase more gold as collateral.\nOur customized production sales volume increased from 36.9 metric tons in 2016 to 51.9 metric tons in 2017, and unit selling price in this segment increased from RMB 4.26 per gram in 2016 to RMB 6.38 per gram in 2017. The reason that the unit selling price of our customized production is significantly lower than the unit selling price of our branded production is in customized production, a customer supplies the Company with the raw materials and the Company creates products per that customer's instructions, whereas in branded production the Company generally purchases gold directly and manufactures and markets the products of its own.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income (loss). The unrealized gain or loss resulting from the change of the fair market value and the foreign currency translation gain or loss resulting from translation of the financial statements expressed in RMB to US$ are reported in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and the consolidated statements of changes in equity and is net of tax.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had total outstanding loans of $2,626.7 million (including $962.1 million short-term loans, $875.2 million from a related parties and $789.4 million long-term loans). As of December 31, 2016, we had total outstanding loans of $1,949.1 million (including $234.7 million short-term loans, $28.8 million loan from a third party, $460.8 million from a related party and $1,224.8 million long-term loans), representing an increase of $677.6 million, or 34.8%. The amounts outstanding under these loans are presented in our financial statements as loans\u201d; the amounts outstanding under the third party loans are presented in our financial statements as Third Party Loans\u201d, and the amounts outstanding under the related party loan are presented in our financial statements as Related Party Loan\u201d. For additional information regarding our loans, please refer to Notes 5, 9, and 10 in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCost of sales\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1,856.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase net cash provided by the financing activities was mainly due to the fact that the Company utilized additional short term and long term bank loans, as well as the loans from two third parties and two related parties.\n 42 \nOur overall gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 10.3%, an increase of 6.5% as compared to gross margin of 3.8% in 2015. The primary reason for the substantial increase in gross margin is due to the increase of selling price per unit on our branded production sales.\nOther comprehensive income was approximately $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to other comprehensive loss of $76.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the unrealized gain related to investment in gold and the appreciation of RMB against the U.S. Dollar.\nWe must make various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets. We use set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management, and estimate the fair value of our reporting units by using undiscounted cash flow analyses. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for the underlying assets at such time. Any such resulting impairment charges could be material to our results of operations.\nOur cost of sales consists principally of the cost for raw materials, primarily gold. We generally purchase gold directly from the Shanghai Gold Exchange, of which we are a member. We lease gold from leading commercial banks in China to increase our gold supply and fuel our growth. We generally do not enter into long term purchase agreements for gold. During recent years, the price of gold on the international gold market has experienced periods of significant fluctuation. We have been attempting to offset gold price fluctuations by locking in the price at the time an order is placed, as well as passing on the price to purchasers.\n 49 \n 51 \n (2) Represents the outstanding principal balance of short-term loans from bank and financial institutions. \nAs of December 31, 2016, two non-related parties repaid approximately $7.2 million (RMB 50 million) in bank loans, and a related party repaid approximately $144 million (RMB 1,000 million) in bank loan, with the outstanding guarantee payment of approximately $28.8 million (RMB 200 million) for a non-related party in bank loans.\nTotal translation gain recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $22,752,426. Total translation loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $21,461,689. Total translation loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $14,740,716.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nThe Company recognizes services-based revenue (the processing fee) from such contracts for customized production when: (i) the contracted services have been performed and (ii) collectability is deemed probable.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,420.6 million, an increase of $420.4 million, or 42%, from net sales of $1,000.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our branded production sales accounted for 98.3% of the total sales and customized production sales accounted for 1.7% of the total sales. When comparing with 2015, our branded production sales increased by $421.2 million or 43.2%, our customized production sales decreased by $0.65 million or 2.7%.\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\n 53 \nCost of Sales\nOur customized production sales volume increased from 27.6 metric tons in 2015 to 36.9 metric tons in 2016, and unit selling price in this segment decreased from RMB 5.48 per gram in 2015 to RMB 4.26 per gram in 2016. The reason that the unit selling price of our customized production is much lower than the unit selling price of our branded production is in customized production, a customer supplies the Company with the raw materials and the Company creates products per that customer's instructions, whereas in branded production the Company generally purchases gold directly and manufactures and markets the products of its own.\nOperating activities:\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of RMB may materially affect our financial condition in terms of U.S. dollar reporting.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect management's assumptions based on the best available information.\nWe expect that cash generated from financing activities may increase significantly as a result of additional financing being obtained to meet the needs of expanded production.\nForeign Currency Translations\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016\n 55 \nGold sales for the twelve months ended December 31,\nExpenses\nThe FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\u201d The ASU amends ASC 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\u201d In addition, under the ASU, an entity will be required to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nWe have maintained a close relationship with the banks from where we leased gold in the past. Therefore we expect that we are able to obtain additional gold leases from the banks, if necessary. We are expecting to generate additional cash flows in the coming period of time from developing new customers, expanding our sales through our online sales platform and an increase in our revenue in the following years due to the higher interest of inventing in gold to against the currency depreciation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\". The amendments in this ASU clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. Basically these amendments provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business. If the screen is not met, the amendments in this ASU first, require that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and second, remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. These amendments take effect for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those periods. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had positive working capital of $768.3 million and $459.9 million, respectively. We believe that our current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including our cash needs for working capital for the next 12 months. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends partially on our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue, while continuing to control costs. We continue to seek favorable additional financing to meet our capital requirements to fund our operations and growth plans in the ordinary course of business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we also guaranteed payment for a related party of approximately $307.4 million (RMB 2,000 million) for two bank loans. The loans were repaid upon maturity in January 2018 and February 2018, respectively.\nGold sales for the twelve months ended December 31,\nNo representation is made that RMB amounts have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars at the above rates or at all. Although Chinese government regulations now allow convertibility of RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain. Hence, such translations should not be construed as representations that RMB can be converted into U.S. dollars at the above conversion rate, or any other rate.\nResults of Operations\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\n(IN U.S. DOLLARS)\nCost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $1,809.8 million, an increase of $535.5 million, or 42% from $1,274.3 million for 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher volume of products sold in fiscal 2017, as well as the rising trend of gold cost in the market during fiscal 2017. The sale quantity increased 37.2% to approximately 103.4 metric tons in 2017 from 75.3 metric tons in 2016. In addition, the average cost of gold has increased due to the gold market price in 2017.\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nCompetitive pricing pressure and changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our long-lived assets, and thus could result in future impairment losses.\nInvesting activities:\nThe overall increase in our revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the following combined factors: (1) total sales volume (in terms of quantity sold) increased from 56.5 metric tons in 2015 to 75.3 metric tons in 2016, causing 18.8 metric tons or 33.4% increase. As a result, approximately $331.8 million increase in our revenue was attributable to the increase in our sales volume. (2) The average unit selling price for branded production increased from RMB 210.45 per gram in 2015 to RMB 241.33 per gram in 2016, causing 14.7% increase. As a result, approximately $143.1 million increase in brand production revenue was affected by the increase in our selling price. The increase in branded production sales was attributable to the Company's strengthened sales efforts and the increase in the market demand during the 2016 when market price of gold increased, which stimulated and inspired the customers to increase their investments on gold. (3) Foreign currency adjustment effect was approximately $49.1 million foreign currency translation loss converting RMB into USD when the average exchange rate of USD: RMB increased from 1 USD=6.2288 RMB in 2015 to 1 USD=6.6441 RMB in 2016.\n (1) Represents the outstanding principal balance of long-term loans from bank and financial institutions. \nCash Flow for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nExpenses\nThe Company recognizes revenue on sales of branded products when the goods are delivered and title to the goods passes to the customer provided that: there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the sales price is fixed and determinable; and collectability is deemed probable.\nOur net cash from operating activities can fluctuate significantly due to changes in our inventories. Other factors that may vary significantly include our accounts payable, purchases of gold and income taxes. Looking forward, we expect the net cash that we generate from operating activities to continue to fluctuate as our inventories, receivables, accounts payables and the other factors described above change with increased production and the purchase of larger or smaller quantities of raw materials. These fluctuations could cause net cash from operating activities to decrease, even if our net income grows as we continue to expand. Although we expect that net cash from operating activities will increase over the long term, we cannot predict how these fluctuations will affect our cash flow in any particular accounting period.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2,009.7 million, an increase of $589.1 million, or 41%, from net sales of $1,420.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our branded production sales accounted for 97.6% of the total sales and customized production sales accounted for 2.4% of the total sales. When comparing with 2016, our branded production sales increased by $563.8 million or 40.4%, our customized production sales increased by $25.3 million or 107.2%.\n 41 \nWe pledged the gold leased from related party and part of our own gold inventory to meet the requirements of bank loans. The pledged gold will be available for sale upon the repayment of the bank loans. We classified these pledged gold as investments in gold, and carried at fair market value, with the unrealized gains and losses, included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in shareholders' equity. The fair market value of the investments in gold is determined by quoted market prices at Shanghai Gold Exchange. Since the investments in gold are pledged for the bank loans, any material decrease in market value may negatively impact the loan covenants.\nNet Sales", "item_7_tables": "Table 117: <table> <tr>
