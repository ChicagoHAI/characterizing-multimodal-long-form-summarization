Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the other sections contained in this Form 10-K. This section contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. These measures include net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company's performance. The tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. As a result of the enactment on December 21, 2017 of the Tax Act, which reduced the federal income tax rate for corporations from a maximum of 35% to 21%, the Company utilized a blended tax rate of 30.8% to calculate the tax equivalent adjustment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis, and accordingly believes that providing these measures may be useful for peer comparison purposes. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for the results determined to be in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has identified policies that due to judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of investment securities, the valuation of REO and foreclosed assets, goodwill valuation and the calculation of income taxes. These policies and the judgments, estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In particular, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" describes generally the Company's accounting policies. Management believes that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nOperating Strategy\nFiscal year 2018 marked the 95th anniversary since the Bank began operations in 1923. The primary business strategy of the Company is to provide comprehensive banking and related financial services within its primary market area. The historical emphasis had previously been on residential real estate lending. Since 1998, however, the Company has been diversifying its loan portfolio through the expansion of its commercial and construction loan portfolios. At March 31, 2018, commercial and construction loans represented 87.1% of total loans. Commercial lending, including commercial real estate loans, typically has higher credit risk, greater interest margins and shorter terms than residential lending which can increase the loan portfolio's profitability.\nThe Company's goal is to deliver returns to shareholders by increasing higher-yielding assets (in particular, commercial real estate and commercial business loans), increasing core deposit balances, managing problem assets, reducing expenses, hiring experienced employees with a commercial lending focus and exploring expansion opportunities. The Company seeks to achieve these results by focusing on the following objectives:\nExecution of our Business Plan. The Company is focused on increasing its loan portfolio, especially higher yielding commercial and construction loans, and its core deposits by expanding its customer base throughout its primary market areas. By emphasizing total relationship banking, the Company intends to deepen the relationships with its customers and increase individual customer profitability through cross-marketing programs, which allows the Company to better identify lending opportunities and services for customers. To build its core deposit base, the Company will continue to utilize additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. The Company will also continue to seek to expand its franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and whole bank transactions that meet its investment and market objectives, such as the February 2017 MBank transaction.\nMaintaining Strong Asset Quality. The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The Company has actively managed the delinquent loans and nonperforming assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts, marketing saleable properties upon foreclosure or repossession, and through work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. In the past several years, the Company has applied more conservative and stringent underwriting practices to new loans, including, among other things, increasing the amount of required collateral or equity requirements, reducing loan-to-value ratios and increasing debt service coverage ratios resulting in improved credit metrics/asset quality. Although the Company intends to prudently increase the percentage of its assets consisting of higher-yielding commercial real estate, real estate construction and commercial business loans, which offer higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the Company intends to manage credit exposure through the use of experienced bankers in these areas and a conservative approach to its lending.\nImplementation of a Profit Improvement Plan (\"PIP\"). The Company has formed a committee comprised of several members of management and the Board of Directors to undertake several initiatives to reduce non-interest expense and continue its on-going efforts to identify cost saving opportunities throughout all aspects of the Company's operations. The PIP committee's mission is not only to find additional cost saving opportunities but also to search for and implement revenue enhancements and additional areas for improvement. The Company has instituted expense control measures such as cancelling certain projects and capital purchases, and reducing travel and entertainment and other noninterest expenditures. As a result, the Company has improved its efficiency ratio over the last several years from 98.0% at March 31, 2014 to 66.4% at March 31, 2018.\nIntroduction of New Products and Services. The Company continuously reviews new products and services to provide its customers more financial options. All new technology and services are generally reviewed for business development and cost saving purposes. The Company continues to experience growth in customer use of its online banking services, where the Bank provides a full array of traditional cash management products as well as online banking products including mobile banking, mobile deposit, bill pay, e-statements, and text banking. The products are tailored to meet the needs of small to medium size businesses and households in the markets we serve. The Bank has implemented remote check capture at all of its branches and for selected customers of the Bank. The Company also intends to selectively add other products to further diversify revenue sources and to capture more of each customer's banking relationship by cross selling loan and deposit products and additional services to Bank customers, including services provided through the Trust Company to increase its fee income. Assets under management by the Trust Company totaled $484.3 million and $425.9 million at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Beginning in November 2017, the Company began offering a third-party identity theft product to its customers. The identity theft product assists our customers in monitoring their credit and includes an identity theft restoration service. In December 2016, the Company switched its existing debit card holders from Visa\u00ae to MasterCard\u00ae. The change in debit card service providers increased interchange revenue and has provided cost savings to the Company.\nAttracting Core Deposits and Other Deposit Products. The Company offers personal checking, savings and money-market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less likely to be withdrawn when interest rates fluctuate. To build its core deposit base, the Company has sought to reduce its dependence on traditional higher cost deposits in favor of stable lower cost core deposits to fund loan growth and decrease its reliance on other wholesale funding sources, including FHLB and FRB advances. The Company believes that its continued focus on building customer relationships will help to increase the level of core deposits and locally-based retail certificates of deposit. In addition, the Company intends to increase demand deposits by growing business banking relationships through expanded product lines tailored to meet its target business customers' needs. The Company maintains technology-based products to encourage the growth of lower cost deposits, such as personal financial management, business cash management, and business remote deposit products, that enable it to meet its customers' cash management needs and compete effectively with banks of all sizes. Core branch deposits increased $22.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017, reflecting organic deposit growth.\nRecruiting and Retaining Highly Competent Personnel with a Focus on Commercial Lending. The Company's ability to continue to attract and retain banking professionals with strong community relationships and significant knowledge of its markets will be a key to its success. The Company believes that it enhances its market position and adds profitable growth opportunities by focusing on hiring and retaining experienced bankers focused on owner occupied commercial real estate and commercial lending, and the deposit balances that accompany these relationships. The Company emphasizes to its employees the importance of delivering exemplary customer service and seeking opportunities to build further relationships with its customers. The goal is to compete with other financial service providers by relying on the strength of the Company's customer service and relationship banking approach. The Company believes that one of its strengths is that its employees are also shareholders through the Company's employee stock ownership (\"ESOP\") and 401(k) plans.\nComparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2018 and 2017\nCash and cash equivalents, including interest-earning accounts, totaled $44.8 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $64.6 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in cash balances was primarily the result of funding the increase in loans receivable and investment securities. The Company has deployed a portion of its excess cash balances into investment securities to earn higher yields than the nominal yield earned on cash held in interest-earning accounts based on its asset/liability management program and liquidity objectives in order to maximize earnings. As a part of this strategy, the Company also invests a portion of its excess cash in short-term certificates of deposit held for investment. All of the certificates of deposit held for investment are fully insured by the FDIC. At March 31, 2018, certificates of deposits held for investment totaled $6.0 million compared to $11.0 million at March 31, 2017.\nInvestment securities totaled $213.3 million and $200.3 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was due to a decision by the Company to invest additional excess cash into higher yielding investment securities. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company purchased $47.5 million of investment securities. The Company primarily purchases a combination of securities backed by government agencies (FHLMC, FNMA, SBA or GNMA). At March 31, 2018, the Company determined that none of its investment securities required an OTTI charge. For additional information on the Company's investment securities, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLoans receivable, net, totaled $800.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $768.9 million at March 31, 2017, an increase of $31.7 million. The Company has had steady loan demand in its market areas and anticipates continuing organic loan growth. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate, either as primary or secondary collateral, located in the Company's primary market areas. Risks associated with loans secured by real estate include decreases in land and property values, increases in interest rates, deterioration in local economic conditions, tightening credit or refinancing markets, and a geographic concentration of loans. The Company has no option adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) or teaser residential real estate loans in its loan portfolio.\nBeginning in March 2017, the Company periodically began purchasing the guaranteed portion of SBA loans as a way to supplement loan originations, further diversify its loan portfolio and earn a higher yield than earned on its cash or short-term investments. These SBA loans are originated through another financial institution located outside the Company's primary market area. These loans are purchased with servicing retained by the seller. At March 31, 2018, the Company's purchased SBA loan portfolio was $47.0 million compared to $5.6 million at March 31, 2017. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Bank purchased $42.8 million of SBA loans, including premiums.\nGoodwill was $27.1 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017. For the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter ended December 31, 2017 and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. For additional information on our goodwill impairment testing, see \"Goodwill Valuation\" included in this Item 7.\nDeposits increased $15.6 million to $995.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $980.1 million at March 31, 2017. The increase is the result of continued organic deposit growth. The Company had no wholesale-brokered deposits at March 31, 2018 and 2017. Core branch deposits accounted for 98.3% of total deposits at March 31, 2018 compared to 97.6% at March 31, 2017. The Company plans to continue its focus on core deposits and on building customer relationships as opposed to obtaining deposits through the wholesale markets.\nShareholders' equity increased $5.6 million to $116.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $111.3 million at March 31, 2017. The increase was mainly attributable to net income of $10.2 million. The increase was partially offset by cash dividends declared of $2.4 million and an increase in other comprehensive loss related to unrealized holding loss on securities available for sale, of $3.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nGoodwill Valuation\nGoodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested, at least annually, for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company has two reporting units, the Bank and the Trust Company, for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment. All of the Company's goodwill has been allocated to the Bank reporting unit. The Company performs an annual review in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist, to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary. If the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and additional analysis must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, the Company would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, the Company would record an impairment charge for the difference.\nA significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2017. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. Step one of the goodwill impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing the allocation of corporate value approach, the income approach and the market approach in order to derive an enterprise value of the Company. The allocation of corporate value approach applies the aggregate market value of the Company and divides it among the reporting units. A key assumption in this approach is the control premium applied to the aggregate market value. A control premium is utilized as the value of a company from the perspective of a controlling interest is generally higher than the widely quoted market price per share. The Company used an expected control premium of 30%, which was based on comparable transactional history. The income approach uses a reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a rate that reflects current market conditions. The projection uses management's best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in loans and deposits, estimates of future expected changes in net interest margins and cash expenditures. Assumptions used by the Company in its discounted cash flow model (income approach) included an annual revenue growth rate that approximated 6.9%, a net interest margin that approximated 4.3% and a return on assets that ranged from 1.17% to 1.38% (average of 1.27%). In addition to utilizing the above projections of estimated operating results, key assumptions used to determine the fair value estimate under the income approach were the discount rate of 14.26% utilized for our cash flow estimates and a terminal value estimated at 1.8 times the ending book value of the reporting unit. The Company used a build-up approach in developing the discount rate that included: an assessment of the risk free interest rate, the rate of return expected from publicly traded stocks, the industry the Company operates in and the size of the Company. The market approach estimates fair value by applying tangible book value multiples to the reporting unit's operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting unit. In applying the market approach method, the Company selected four publicly traded comparable institutions. After selecting comparable institutions, the Company derived the fair value of the reporting unit by completing a comparative analysis of the relationship between their financial metrics listed above and their market values utilizing a market multiple of 1.5 times tangible book value. The Company calculated a fair value of its reporting unit of $265.0 million using the corporate value approach, $196.5 million using the income approach and $275.0 million using the market approach, with a final concluded value of $250.0 million, with primary weight given to the market approach. The results of the Company's step one test indicated that the reporting unit's fair value was greater than its carrying value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists.\nEven though the Company determined that there was no goodwill impairment, a decline in the value of its stock price as well as values of other financial institutions, declines in revenue for the Company beyond our current forecasts, significant adverse changes in the operating environment for the financial industry or an increase in the value of our assets without an increase in the value of the reporting unit may result in a future impairment charge.\nIt is possible that changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management's judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill, could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of our goodwill. If the Company recorded an impairment charge, its financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected; however, such an impairment charge would have no impact on our liquidity, operations or regulatory capital.\nEstimated Fair Value of Level 3 Assets\nThe Company determines the estimated fair value of certain assets that are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established under GAAP. These Level 3 assets are valued using significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the estimated fair value of the assets. These Level 3 assets include certain loans measured for impairment and REO for which there is neither an active market for identical assets from which to determine fair value, nor is there sufficient, current market information about similar assets to use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs in a valuation model. Under these circumstances, the estimated fair values of these assets are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, appraisals, and other valuation methods in accordance with accounting standards, for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nValuations using models or other techniques are dependent upon assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of the valuation date. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. Judgment is then applied in formulating those inputs.\nCertain loans included in the loan portfolio were deemed impaired at March 31, 2018. Accordingly, loans measured for impairment were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as there is no active market for these loans. Measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates, and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates. Impairment was measured based on a number of factors, including recent independent appraisals which are further reduced for estimated selling costs or by estimating the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate.\nIn addition, REO is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, if applicable. Management generally determines fair value based on a number of factors, including third-party appraisals of fair value less estimated costs to sell. The valuation of REO is subject to significant external and internal judgment, and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates.\nFor additional information on our Level 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet Income. Net income was $10.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2018, compared to $7.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2017. The earnings for the year ended March 31, 2018 improved due to an increase in net interest income and non-interest income, which was partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense primarily as a result of the MBank transaction. In addition, net income for the year ended March 31, 2018 was negatively affected due to the impact of the federal corporate income tax rate change included in the Tax Act, which resulted in a $1.6 million net increase to the Company's provision for income taxes. This one-time charge to the provision for income taxes was due to the Company revaluing its deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the lower enacted federal corporate income tax rate at which the Company expects to recognize the benefit and was offset by the benefit resulting from the use of an overall lower blended federal corporate income tax rate.\nNet Interest Income. The Company's profitability depends primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the income it receives on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. When the rate earned on interest-earning assets equals or exceeds the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, this positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income. The Company's results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, government legislation and regulation, and monetary and fiscal policies.\nNet interest income for fiscal year 2018 increased $8.9 million, or 26.2%, to $42.6 million compared to $33.8 million in fiscal year 2017. The net interest margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was 4.08% compared to 3.79% for the prior fiscal year. This increase in the net interest margin was primarily the result of the increase in the average balance of loans receivable as a result of organic loan growth, purchased guaranteed portions of SBA loans and acquired loans as part of the MBank transaction. In addition, the increase in net interest margin was also attributable to the increase in investment securities.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased to $45.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from $35.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 due primarily to increases in interest from loans receivable and investment securities of $8.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. These increases were primarily due to higher average balances for both loans receivable and investment securities as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nThe average balance of net loans increased $126.1 million to $789.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from $663.1 million for the prior fiscal year. The average yield on net loans was 5.03% for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 4.77% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of investment securities increased $38.9 million to $214.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to $175.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 totaled $2.3 million, a $480,000 or 25.7% increase from $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense related to variable rate subordinated debentures, which repriced quarterly based on the three-month LIBOR, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits due primarily to the MBank transaction. The weighted average interest rate on other interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.85% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 2.76% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $85.0 million to $714.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to $628.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The weighted average interest rate on interest-bearing deposits decreased to 0.17% for fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from 0.18% for the prior fiscal year.\nProvision for Loan Losses. There was no provision for or recapture of loan losses for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 as a result of adequate reserves already in place and net recoveries, as well as the stabilization in the level of delinquent, nonperforming and classified loans, and the stabilization of real estate values in our market areas.\nIn accordance with GAAP, loans acquired from MBank were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loans' contractual amounts, of which a portion reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value and as a result no allowance for loan losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. The discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or related allowance coverage ratios. However, we believe it should be considered when comparing certain financial ratios of the Company calculated in periods after the MBank transaction, compared to the same financial ratios of the Company in periods prior to the MBank transaction. See Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. At March 31, 2018, the Company had an allowance for loan losses of $10.8 million, or 1.33% of total loans, compared to $10.5 million, or 1.35% at March 31, 2017.\nNet recoveries for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $238,000 and $643,000, respectively. Net recoveries to average net loans for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were (0.03)% and (0.10)%, respectively. Nonperforming loans at March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $2.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to 445.24% at March 31, 2018 compared to 382.98% at March 31, 2017.\nImpaired loans are subjected to an impairment analysis to determine an appropriate reserve amount to be held against each loan. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had identified $7.7 million of impaired loans. Because the significant majority of the impaired loans are collateral dependent, nearly all of the specific allowances are calculated based on the estimated fair value of the collateral. Of those impaired loans, $6.6 million have no specific valuation allowance as their estimated collateral value is equal to or exceeds the carrying amount of the loan, which in some cases is the result of previous loan charge-offs. The remaining $1.1 million have specific valuation allowances totaling $69,000. Charge-offs on these impaired loans totaled $83,000 from their original loan balances. Based on a comprehensive analysis, management deemed the allowance for loan losses of $10.8 million at March 31, 2018 adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $1.0 million to $11.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 from $10.0 million for fiscal year 2017. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to the increase in fees and service charges and asset management fees of $602,000 and $460,000, respectively. Other non-interest income for the year ended March 31, 2017 included a $240,000 OTTI charge related to a collateralized debt obligation security which was not present for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $2.6 million to $35.6 million for fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to $33.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior fiscal year partially due to the reorganization of various departments due to retirements and also due to additional staffing as a result of the MBank transaction. Occupancy and depreciation, amortization of CDI and data processing expense increased $635,000, $205,000 and $202,000, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the MBank transaction. The Company incurred an entire year of increased cost in the fiscal year 2018 due to the MBank transaction, compared to incurring approximately two months of related cost in the fiscal year 2017. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in professional fees of $447,000 for the fiscal year 2018 compared to the fiscal year 2017, primarily due to $653,000 in professional fees incurred in the fiscal year 2017 related to the MBank transaction. In addition, non-interest expense for fiscal year 2017 included litigation settlement costs related to an REO property of $500,000 which was not present for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $7.8 million and $3.4 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate was 43.1% for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 31.4% for the year ended March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $4.8 million. The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate was higher for the fiscal year 2018 compared to the fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a net charge to the provision for income taxes of $1.6 million. This one-time charge to the provision for income taxes was the result of the enactment of the Tax Act, which required the Company to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the lower enacted federal corporate income tax rate at which the Company expects to recognize the benefit and was offset by the benefit resulting from the use of an overall lower blended federal corporate income tax rate. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company utilized a blended tax rate of 30.8% for the fiscal year 2018. As of March 31, 2018, management deemed that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the Company's deferred tax asset was not necessary. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet Income. Net income was $7.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2017, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2016. The earnings for the year ended March 31, 2017 improved due to an increase in net interest income and non-interest income, which was partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. In addition, net income for the year ended March 31, 2017 did not include any provision or recapture of loan loss compared to a recapture of loan losses of $1.2 million for the prior fiscal year.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for fiscal year 2017 increased $4.6 million, or 15.6%, to $33.8 million compared to $29.2 million in fiscal year 2016. The net interest margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was 3.79% compared to 3.67% for the prior fiscal year. This increase in the net interest margin was primarily the result of the increase in the average balance of loans receivable and investment securities.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased to $35.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 from $30.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 due primarily to increases in interest from loans receivable and investment securities of $3.8 million and $866,000, respectively. These increases were primarily due to higher average balances for both loans receivable and investment securities as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nThe average balance of net loans increased $69.7 million to $663.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 from $593.4 million for the prior fiscal year. The average yield on net loans was 4.77% for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 4.68% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of investment securities increased $41.4 million to $175.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to $134.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 totaled $1.9 million, a $127,000 or 7.29% increase from $1.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense related to variable rate subordinated debentures, which repriced quarterly based on the three-month LIBOR, and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The weighted average interest rate on other interest-bearing liabilities increased to 2.76% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 2.27% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $56.0 million to $628.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to $572.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on interest-bearing deposits decreased to 0.18% for fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 from 0.20% for the prior fiscal year.\nProvision for Loan Losses. There was no provision for or recapture of loan losses for the fiscal year 2017 as a result of adequate reserves already in place and overall net recoveries. The recapture of loan losses totaled $1.2 million for the fiscal year ended 2016. The recapture of loan losses for fiscal year 2016 was primarily a result of a decrease in charge-offs and the decline in the level of delinquent, nonperforming and classified loans, as well as the stabilization of real estate values in our market areas.\nIn accordance with GAAP, loans acquired from MBank were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loans' contractual amounts, of which a portion reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value and as a result no allowance for loan losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. The discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or related allowance coverage ratios. However, we believe it should be considered when comparing certain financial ratios of the Company calculated in periods after the MBank transaction, compared to the same financial ratios of the Company in periods prior to the MBank transaction. At March 31, 2017, the Company had an allowance for loan losses of $10.5 million, or 1.35% of total loans, compared to $9.9 million, or 1.58% at March 31, 2016. See Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet recoveries for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $643,000 and $273,000, respectively. Net recoveries to average net loans for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were (0.10)% and (0.05)%, respectively. Nonperforming loans remained at $2.7 million at both March 31, 2017 and 2016. The allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to 382.98% at March 31, 2017 compared to 364.22% at March 31, 2016.\nImpaired loans are subjected to an impairment analysis to determine an appropriate reserve amount to be held against each loan. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had identified $11.9 million of impaired loans. Because the significant majority of the impaired loans are collateral dependent, nearly all of the specific allowances are calculated based on the estimated fair value of the collateral. Of those impaired loans, $10.7 million have no specific valuation allowance as their estimated collateral value is equal to or exceeds the carrying amount of the loan, which in some cases is the result of previous loan charge-offs. The remaining $1.2 million have specific valuation allowances totaling $88,000. Charge-offs on these impaired loans totaled $83,000 from their original loan balances. Based on a comprehensive analysis, management deemed the allowance for loan losses of $10.5 million at March 31, 2017 adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $639,000 to $10.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 from $9.4 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to the increase in fees and service charges and net gains on sales of loans held for sale of $331,000 and $131,000, respectively. Additionally, other non-interest income in fiscal year 2017 increased $411,000 due primarily to a BOLI death benefit on a former employee of $423,000. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in asset management fees of $224,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. Other non-interest income for the year ended March 31, 2017 included a $240,000 OTTI charge related to a collateralized debt obligation security which was not present for the year ended March 31, 2016. Additionally, losses on sales of REO, which is included in other non-interest income, decreased $182,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $3.0 million to $33.0 million for fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to $29.9 million for fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year partially due to additional staffing as a result of the MBank transaction. Professional fees increased $724,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to $653,000 in professional fees incurred related to the MBank transaction. Data processing expense increased $336,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting additional costs required to operate an additional core banking system as well as costs for conversion and integration of the two core banking systems associated with the MBank transaction. Litigation settlement costs related to an REO property increased $400,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year as the litigation was concluded in fiscal year 2017. In addition, advertising and marketing expense increased $85,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in REO expenses (which include operating costs and write-downs on property) of $513,000 for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in REO balances as well as the stabilization of real estate values in the Company's market area. In addition, the Company's FDIC insurance premiums also decreased $144,000 compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting a decrease in the Bank's FDIC assessment rates.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $3.4 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The effective tax rate was 31.4% for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 34.8% for the year ended March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, management deemed that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the Company's deferred tax asset was not necessary. At March 31, 2017, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $7.6 million which included $1.1 million for federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.\nAverage Balance Sheet. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income earned on average interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spread, ratio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities and net interest margin. Average balances for a period have been calculated using monthly average balances during such period. Non-accruing loans were included in the average loan amounts outstanding. Loan fees, net, of $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $980,000 were included in interest income for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

fully tax-equivalent basis.\nAsset and Liability Management\nThe Company's principal financial objective is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates. The Company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates. The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity increases by retaining portfolio loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and selling fixed-rate one-to-four family mortgage loans with terms to maturity of more than 15 years. The Company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds. Management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a stable source of funds. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms up to ten years.\nThe Company has adopted a strategy that is designed to maintain or improve the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities. The primary elements of this strategy involve: the origination of adjustable rate loans; increasing commercial loans, consumer loans that are adjustable rate and other short-term loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one-to-four family residential mortgage loans; matching asset and liability maturities; investing in short-term securities; and selling most long term, fixed-rate, one-to-four family mortgage loan originations. The strategy for liabilities has been to shorten the maturities for both deposits and borrowings. The longer-term objective is to increase the proportion of noninterest bearing demand deposits, low interest bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings deposits relative to certificates of deposit to reduce our overall cost of funds.\nThe Company's mortgage servicing activities provide additional protection from interest rate risk. The Company retains servicing rights on all mortgage loans sold. As market interest rates rise, the fixed-rate loans held in the loan portfolio diminish in value. However, the value of the servicing loan portfolio tends to rise as market interest rates increase because borrowers tend not to prepay the underlying mortgages, thus providing an interest rate risk hedge versus the fixed-rate loan portfolio. See \"Item 1. Business - Lending Activities - Mortgage Loan Servicing.\"\nConsumer loans, such as home equity lines of credit and installment loans, commercial loans and construction loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans, and accordingly reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Adjustable interest rate loans totaled $477.1 million or 58.80% of total loans at March 31, 2018 as compared to $490.6 million or 62.95% at March 31, 2017. Although the Company has sought to originate adjustable rate loans, the ability to originate and purchase such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers' preferences. Particularly in lower interest rate environments, borrowers often prefer to obtain fixed-rate loans. See Item 1. \"Business - Lending Activities - Real Estate Construction \" and \"- Lending Activities - Consumer Lending.\"\nThe Company may also invest in short-term to medium-term U.S. Government securities as well as mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies. At March 31, 2018, the combined investment portfolio carried at $213.3 million had an average life of 4.9 years. Adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities totaled $17.8 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $10.2 million at March 31, 2017. See Item 1. \"Business - Investment Activities.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is essential to our business. The objective of the Bank's liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals, to fund the borrowing needs of loan customers, and to fund ongoing operations. Core relationship deposits are the primary source of the Bank's liquidity. As such, the Bank focuses on deposit relationships with local consumer and business clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the Bank.\nLiquidity management is both a short and long-term responsibility of the Company's management. The Company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management's assessment of (i) expected loan demand, (ii) projected loan sales, (iii) expected deposit flows, (iv) yields available on interest-bearing deposits and (v) its asset/liability management program objectives. Excess liquidity is invested generally in interest-bearing overnight deposits and other short-term government and agency obligations. If the Company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, it has additional diversified and reliable sources of funds with the FHLB, the FRB and other wholesale facilities. These sources of funds may be used on a long or short-term basis to compensate for a reduction in other sources of funds or on a long-term basis to support lending activities.\nThe Company's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the sale of loans, maturing securities, FHLB advances and FRB borrowings. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and prepayment of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Management believes that its focus on core relationship deposits coupled with access to borrowing through reliable counterparties provides reasonable and prudent assurance that ample liquidity is available. However, depositor or counterparty behavior could change in response to competition, economic or market situations or other unforeseen circumstances, which could have liquidity implications that may require different strategic or operational actions.\nThe Company must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds for loan originations, deposit withdrawals and continuing operations, satisfy other financial commitments and take advantage of investment opportunities. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Bank used its sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments and purchase additional investment securities. At March 31, 2018, cash and available for sale investments totaled $264.0 million, or 22.9% of total assets. The Bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short-term investments to meet short-term liquidity needs; however, its primary liquidity management practice is to increase or decrease short-term borrowings, including FRB borrowings and FHLB advances. At March 31, 2018, the Bank had no advances from the FRB and had a borrowing capacity of $57.4 million from the FRB, subject to sufficient collateral. At March 31, 2018, there were no advances from the FHLB and the Bank had an available borrowing capacity of $279.0 million, subject to sufficient collateral and stock investment. At March 31, 2018, the Bank had sufficient unpledged collateral to allow it to utilize its available borrowing capacity from the FRB and the FHLB. Borrowing capacity may, however, fluctuate based on acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion.\nAn additional source of wholesale funding includes brokered certificates of deposit. While the Company has utilized brokered deposits from time to time, the Company historically has not extensively relied on brokered deposits to fund its operations. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank had no wholesale brokered deposits. The Bank also participates in the CDARS and ICS deposit products, which allow the Company to accept deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit for that depositor and obtain \"pass-through\" insurance for the total deposit. The Bank's CDARS and ICS balances were $23.6 million, or 2.4% of total deposits, and $24.3 million, or 2.5% of total deposits, at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, the Bank is enrolled in an internet deposit listing service. Under this listing service, the Bank may post time deposit rates on an internet site where institutional investors have the ability to deposit funds with the Bank. At March 31, 2018, the Company had no deposits through this listing service. At March 31, 2017, the Company had $7.0 million of deposits through this listing service which were assumed in the MBank transaction. Although the Company did not originate any internet based deposits during the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company may do so in the future consistent with its asset/liability objectives. The combination of all the Bank's funding sources gives the Bank available liquidity of $767.4 million, or 66.6% of total assets at March 31, 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had total commitments of $190.5 million, which includes commitments to extend credit of $35.1 million, unused lines of credit totaling $81.0 million, undisbursed construction loans totaling $72.0 million, and standby letters of credit totaling $2.4 million. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from March 31, 2018 totaled $88.9 million. Historically, the Bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature. Offsetting these cash outflows are scheduled loan maturities of less than one year totaling $67.6 million at March 31, 2018.\nRiverview Bancorp, Inc., as a separate legal entity from the Bank, must provide for its own liquidity. Sources of capital and liquidity for Riverview Bancorp, Inc. include distributions from the Bank and the issuance of debt or equity securities. Dividends and other capital distributions from the Bank are subject to regulatory notice. At March 31, 2018, Riverview Bancorp, Inc. had $6.5 million in cash to meet liquidity needs.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company's operations. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their impact on the Company, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table shows the contractual obligations by expected period. Further discussion of commitments is included in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAt March 31, 2018, scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit, future operating minimum lease commitments, capital lease obligations and subordinated debentures were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Within\n1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After\n5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88,915\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,191\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,209\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,829\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123,144\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,639\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,358\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,203\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,989\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,189\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,229\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,431\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior subordinates debentures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27,836\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27,836\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,582\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,623\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,512\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,883\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 160,600\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is periodically a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, these actions will not have a material adverse effect, if any, on the Company's future financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. The Bank has entered into employment contracts with certain key employees, which provide for contingent payment subject to future events.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage, commercial and consumer loans. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company's maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to originate loans are conditional and are honored for up to 45 days subject to the Company's usual terms and conditions. Collateral is not required to support commitments.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had commercial loan commitments of $1.8 million and undisbursed commercial lines of credit of $48.8 million. Commercial real estate mortgage loan commitments totaled $2.7 million and the undisbursed balance of commercial real estate mortgage loans was $11.1 million at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, construction loan commitments totaled $23.8 million and undisbursed construction loans totaled $72.0 million. Unused lines of credit secured by land development loans totaled $2.8 million. Unused lines of credit secured by multi-family loans totaled $394,000. Real estate one-to-four family loan commitments totaled $6.6 million and unused lines of credit secured by real estate one-to-four family loans totaled $16.7 million at March 31, 2018. Other installment loan commitments totaled $220,000 and unused lines of credit on other installment loans totaled $1.2 million at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, the Company had standby letters of credit totaling $2.4 million. For additional information regarding future financial commitments, this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Net Income. Net income was $10.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2018, compared to $7.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2017. The earnings for the year ended March 31, 2018 improved due to an increase in net interest income and non-interest income, which was partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense primarily as a result of the MBank transaction. In addition, net income for the year ended March 31, 2018 was negatively affected due to the impact of the federal corporate income tax rate change included in the Tax Act, which resulted in a $1.6 million net increase to the Company's provision for income taxes. This one-time charge to the provision for income taxes was due to the Company revaluing its deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the lower enacted federal corporate income tax rate at which the Company expects to recognize the benefit and was offset by the benefit resulting from the use of an overall lower blended federal corporate income tax rate.\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Within\n1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After\n5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88,915\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,191\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,209\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,829\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123,144\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,639\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,358\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,203\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,989\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,189\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,229\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,431\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior subordinates debentures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27,836\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27,836\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,582\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,623\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,512\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,883\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 160,600\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral\nShareholders' equity increased $5.6 million to $116.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $111.3 million at March 31, 2017. The increase was mainly attributable to net income of $10.2 million. The increase was partially offset by cash dividends declared of $2.4 million and an increase in other comprehensive loss related to unrealized holding loss on securities available for sale, of $3.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nThe average balance of net loans increased $126.1 million to $789.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from $663.1 million for the prior fiscal year. The average yield on net loans was 5.03% for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 4.77% for the prior fiscal year.

The provision for income taxes was $7.8 million and $3.4 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate was 43.1% for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 31.4% for the year ended March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $4.8 million. The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate was higher for the fiscal year 2018 compared to the fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a net charge to the provision for income taxes of $1.6 million. This one-time charge to the provision for income taxes was the result of the enactment of the Tax Act, which required the Company to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the lower enacted federal corporate income tax rate at which the Company expects to recognize the benefit and was offset by the benefit resulting from the use of an overall lower blended federal corporate income tax rate. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company utilized a blended tax rate of 30.8% for the fiscal year 2018. As of March 31, 2018, management deemed that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the Company's deferred tax asset was not necessary. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nAttracting Core Deposits and Other Deposit Products. The Company offers personal checking, savings and money-market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less likely to be withdrawn when interest rates fluctuate. To build its core deposit base, the Company has sought to reduce its dependence on traditional higher cost deposits in favor of stable lower cost core deposits to fund loan growth and decrease its reliance on other wholesale funding sources, including FHLB and FRB advances. The Company believes that its continued focus on building customer relationships will help to increase the level of core deposits and locally-based retail certificates of deposit. In addition, the Company intends to increase demand deposits by growing business banking relationships through expanded product lines tailored to meet its target business customers' needs. The Company maintains technology-based products to encourage the growth of lower cost deposits, such as personal financial management, business cash management, and business remote deposit products, that enable it to meet its customers' cash management needs and compete effectively with banks of all sizes. Core branch deposits increased $22.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017, reflecting organic deposit growth.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. The objective of the Bank's liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals, to fund the borrowing needs of loan customers, and to fund ongoing operations. Core relationship deposits are the primary source of the Bank's liquidity. As such, the Bank focuses on deposit relationships with local consumer and business clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the Bank.\nRecruiting and Retaining Highly Competent Personnel with a Focus on Commercial Lending. The Company's ability to continue to attract and retain banking professionals with strong community relationships and significant knowledge of its markets will be a key to its success. The Company believes that it enhances its market position and adds profitable growth opportunities by focusing on hiring and retaining experienced bankers focused on owner occupied commercial real estate and commercial lending, and the deposit balances that accompany these relationships. The Company emphasizes to its employees the importance of delivering exemplary customer service and seeking opportunities to build further relationships with its customers. The goal is to compete with other financial service providers by relying on the strength of the Company's customer service and relationship banking approach. The Company believes that one of its strengths is that its employees are also shareholders through the Company's employee stock ownership (\"ESOP\") and 401(k) plans.\nGoodwill was $27.1 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017. For the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter ended December 31, 2017 and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. For additional information on our goodwill impairment testing, see \"Goodwill Valuation\" included in this Item 7.\nThe Company is periodically a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, these actions will not have a material adverse effect, if any, on the Company's future financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. The Bank has entered into employment contracts with certain key employees, which provide for contingent payment subject to future events.\nGoodwill Valuation\nThe Company determines the estimated fair value of certain assets that are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established under GAAP. These Level 3 assets are valued using significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the estimated fair value of the assets. These Level 3 assets include certain loans measured for impairment and REO for which there is neither an active market for identical assets from which to determine fair value, nor is there sufficient, current market information about similar assets to use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs in a valuation model. Under these circumstances, the estimated fair values of these assets are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, appraisals, and other valuation methods in accordance with accounting standards, for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nDeposits increased $15.6 million to $995.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $980.1 million at March 31, 2017. The increase is the result of continued organic deposit growth. The Company had no wholesale-brokered deposits at March 31, 2018 and 2017. Core branch deposits accounted for 98.3% of total deposits at March 31, 2018 compared to 97.6% at March 31, 2017. The Company plans to continue its focus on core deposits and on building customer relationships as opposed to obtaining deposits through the wholesale markets.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased to $45.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from $35.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 due primarily to increases in interest from loans receivable and investment securities of $8.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. These increases were primarily due to higher average balances for both loans receivable and investment securities as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIn accordance with GAAP, loans acquired from MBank were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loans' contractual amounts, of which a portion reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value and as a result no allowance for loan losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. The discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or related allowance coverage ratios. However, we believe it should be considered when comparing certain financial ratios of the Company calculated in periods after the MBank transaction, compared to the same financial ratios of the Company in periods prior to the MBank transaction. At March 31, 2017, the Company had an allowance for loan losses of $10.5 million, or 1.35% of total loans, compared to $9.9 million, or 1.58% at March 31, 2016. See Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had commercial loan commitments of $1.8 million and undisbursed commercial lines of credit of $48.8 million. Commercial real estate mortgage loan commitments totaled $2.7 million and the undisbursed balance of commercial real estate mortgage loans was $11.1 million at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, construction loan commitments totaled $23.8 million and undisbursed construction loans totaled $72.0 million. Unused lines of credit secured by land development loans totaled $2.8 million. Unused lines of credit secured by multi-family loans totaled $394,000. Real estate one-to-four family loan commitments totaled $6.6 million and unused lines of credit secured by real estate one-to-four family loans totaled $16.7 million at March 31, 2018. Other installment loan commitments totaled $220,000 and unused lines of credit on other installment loans totaled $1.2 million at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, the Company had standby letters of credit totaling $2.4 million. For additional information regarding future financial commitments, this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCash and cash equivalents, including interest-earning accounts, totaled $44.8 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $64.6 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in cash balances was primarily the result of funding the increase in loans receivable and investment securities. The Company has deployed a portion of its excess cash balances into investment securities to earn higher yields than the nominal yield earned on cash held in interest-earning accounts based on its asset/liability management program and liquidity objectives in order to maximize earnings. As a part of this strategy, the Company also invests a portion of its excess cash in short-term certificates of deposit held for investment. All of the certificates of deposit held for investment are fully insured by the FDIC. At March 31, 2018, certificates of deposits held for investment totaled $6.0 million compared to $11.0 million at March 31, 2017.\nLoans receivable, net, totaled $800.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $768.9 million at March 31, 2017, an increase of $31.7 million. The Company has had steady loan demand in its market areas and anticipates continuing organic loan growth. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate, either as primary or secondary collateral, located in the Company's primary market areas. Risks associated with loans secured by real estate include decreases in land and property values, increases in interest rates, deterioration in local economic conditions, tightening credit or refinancing markets, and a geographic concentration of loans. The Company has no option adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) or teaser residential real estate loans in its loan portfolio.\nImpaired loans are subjected to an impairment analysis to determine an appropriate reserve amount to be held against each loan. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had identified $11.9 million of impaired loans. Because the significant majority of the impaired loans are collateral dependent, nearly all of the specific allowances are calculated based on the estimated fair value of the collateral. Of those impaired loans, $10.7 million have no specific valuation allowance as their estimated collateral value is equal to or exceeds the carrying amount of the loan, which in some cases is the result of previous loan charge-offs. The remaining $1.2 million have specific valuation allowances totaling $88,000. Charge-offs on these impaired loans totaled $83,000 from their original loan balances. Based on a comprehensive analysis, management deemed the allowance for loan losses of $10.5 million at March 31, 2017 adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses.\nThe Company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has identified policies that due to judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of investment securities, the valuation of REO and foreclosed assets, goodwill valuation and the calculation of income taxes. These policies and the judgments, estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In particular, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" describes generally the Company's accounting policies. Management believes that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\nA significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for fiscal year 2017 increased $4.6 million, or 15.6%, to $33.8 million compared to $29.2 million in fiscal year 2016. The net interest margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was 3.79% compared to 3.67% for the prior fiscal year. This increase in the net interest margin was primarily the result of the increase in the average balance of loans receivable and investment securities.\nAverage Balance Sheet. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income earned on average interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spread, ratio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities and net interest margin. Average balances for a period have been calculated using monthly average balances during such period. Non-accruing loans were included in the average loan amounts outstanding. Loan fees, net, of $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $980,000 were included in interest income for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProvision for Loan Losses. There was no provision for or recapture of loan losses for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 as a result of adequate reserves already in place and net recoveries, as well as the stabilization in the level of delinquent, nonperforming and classified loans, and the stabilization of real estate values in our market areas.\nAt March 31, 2018, scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit, future operating minimum lease commitments, capital lease obligations and subordinated debentures were as follows (in thousands):\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNet recoveries for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $643,000 and $273,000, respectively. Net recoveries to average net loans for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were (0.10)% and (0.05)%, respectively. Nonperforming loans remained at $2.7 million at both March 31, 2017 and 2016. The allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to 382.98% at March 31, 2017 compared to 364.22% at March 31, 2016.\nBeginning in March 2017, the Company periodically began purchasing the guaranteed portion of SBA loans as a way to supplement loan originations, further diversify its loan portfolio and earn a higher yield than earned on its cash or short-term investments. These SBA loans are originated through another financial institution located outside the Company's primary market area. These loans are purchased with servicing retained by the seller. At March 31, 2018, the Company's purchased SBA loan portfolio was $47.0 million compared to $5.6 million at March 31, 2017. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Bank purchased $42.8 million of SBA loans, including premiums.\nConsumer loans, such as home equity lines of credit and installment loans, commercial loans and construction loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans, and accordingly reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Adjustable interest rate loans totaled $477.1 million or 58.80% of total loans at March 31, 2018 as compared to $490.6 million or 62.95% at March 31, 2017. Although the Company has sought to originate adjustable rate loans, the ability to originate and purchase such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers' preferences. Particularly in lower interest rate environments, borrowers often prefer to obtain fixed-rate loans. See Item 1. \"Business - Lending Activities - Real Estate Construction \" and \"- Lending Activities - Consumer Lending.\"\nInvestment securities totaled $213.3 million and $200.3 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was due to a decision by the Company to invest additional excess cash into higher yielding investment securities. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company purchased $47.5 million of investment securities. The Company primarily purchases a combination of securities backed by government agencies (FHLMC, FNMA, SBA or GNMA). At March 31, 2018, the Company determined that none of its investment securities required an OTTI charge. For additional information on the Company's investment securities, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had total commitments of $190.5 million, which includes commitments to extend credit of $35.1 million, unused lines of credit totaling $81.0 million, undisbursed construction loans totaling $72.0 million, and standby letters of credit totaling $2.4 million. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from March 31, 2018 totaled $88.9 million. Historically, the Bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature. Offsetting these cash outflows are scheduled loan maturities of less than one year totaling $67.6 million at March 31, 2018.\nThe Company's principal financial objective is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates. The Company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates. The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity increases by retaining portfolio loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and selling fixed-rate one-to-four family mortgage loans with terms to maturity of more than 15 years. The Company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds. Management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a stable source of funds. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms up to ten years.\nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their impact on the Company, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCertain loans included in the loan portfolio were deemed impaired at March 31, 2018. Accordingly, loans measured for impairment were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as there is no active market for these loans. Measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates, and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates. Impairment was measured based on a number of factors, including recent independent appraisals which are further reduced for estimated selling costs or by estimating the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate.\nThe following table shows the contractual obligations by expected period. Further discussion of commitments is included in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2017. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. Step one of the goodwill impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing the allocation of corporate value approach, the income approach and the market approach in order to derive an enterprise value of the Company. The allocation of corporate value approach applies the aggregate market value of the Company and divides it among the reporting units. A key assumption in this approach is the control premium applied to the aggregate market value. A control premium is utilized as the value of a company from the perspective of a controlling interest is generally higher than the widely quoted market price per share. The Company used an expected control premium of 30%, which was based on comparable transactional history. The income approach uses a reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a rate that reflects current market conditions. The projection uses management's best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in loans and deposits, estimates of future expected changes in net interest margins and cash expenditures. Assumptions used by the Company in its discounted cash flow model (income approach) included an annual revenue growth rate that approximated 6.9%, a net interest margin that approximated 4.3% and a return on assets that ranged from 1.17% to 1.38% (average of 1.27%). In addition to utilizing the above projections of estimated operating results, key assumptions used to determine the fair value estimate under the income approach were the discount rate of 14.26% utilized for our cash flow estimates and a terminal value estimated at 1.8 times the ending book value of the reporting unit. The Company used a build-up approach in developing the discount rate that included: an assessment of the risk free interest rate, the rate of return expected from publicly traded stocks, the industry the Company operates in and the size of the Company. The market approach estimates fair value by applying tangible book value multiples to the reporting unit's operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting unit. In applying the market approach method, the Company selected four publicly traded comparable institutions. After selecting comparable institutions, the Company derived the fair value of the reporting unit by completing a comparative analysis of the relationship between their financial metrics listed above and their market values utilizing a market multiple of 1.5 times tangible book value. The Company calculated a fair value of its reporting unit of $265.0 million using the corporate value approach, $196.5 million using the income approach and $275.0 million using the market approach, with a final concluded value of $250.0 million, with primary weight given to the market approach. The results of the Company's step one test indicated that the reporting unit's fair value was greater than its carrying value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists.\nValuations using models or other techniques are dependent upon assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of the valuation date. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. Judgment is then applied in formulating those inputs.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased to $35.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 from $30.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 due primarily to increases in interest from loans receivable and investment securities of $3.8 million and $866,000, respectively. These increases were primarily due to higher average balances for both loans receivable and investment securities as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet Income. Net income was $7.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2017, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2016. The earnings for the year ended March 31, 2017 improved due to an increase in net interest income and non-interest income, which was partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. In addition, net income for the year ended March 31, 2017 did not include any provision or recapture of loan loss compared to a recapture of loan losses of $1.2 million for the prior fiscal year.\ncarrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and additional analysis must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, the Company would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, the Company would record an impairment charge for the difference.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the other sections contained in this Form 10-K. This section contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. These measures include net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company's performance. The tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. As a result of the enactment on December 21, 2017 of the Tax Act, which reduced the federal income tax rate for corporations from a maximum of 35% to 21%, the Company utilized a blended tax rate of 30.8% to calculate the tax equivalent adjustment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis, and accordingly believes that providing these measures may be useful for peer comparison purposes. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for the results determined to be in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on net interest income of the Company for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Information is provided with respect to: (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) changes in rate/volume (change in rate multiplied by change in volume). Variances that were insignificant have been allocated based upon the percentage relationship of changes in volume and changes in rate to the total net change (in thousands). The changes noted in the table below include tax equivalent adjustments, and as a result, will not agree to the amounts reflected on the Company's consolidated statements of income for the categories that have been adjusted to reflect tax equivalent income.\nGoodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested, at least annually, for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company has two reporting units, the Bank and the Trust Company, for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment. All of the Company's goodwill has been allocated to the Bank reporting unit. The Company performs an annual review in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist, to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary. If the\nAsset and Liability Management\nComparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2018 and 2017\nRiverview Bancorp, Inc., as a separate legal entity from the Bank, must provide for its own liquidity. Sources of capital and liquidity for Riverview Bancorp, Inc. include distributions from the Bank and the issuance of debt or equity securities. Dividends and other capital distributions from the Bank are subject to regulatory notice. At March 31, 2018, Riverview Bancorp, Inc. had $6.5 million in cash to meet liquidity needs.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nContractual Obligations\nFiscal year 2018 marked the 95th anniversary since the Bank began operations in 1923. The primary business strategy of the Company is to provide comprehensive banking and related financial services within its primary market area. The historical emphasis had previously been on residential real estate lending. Since 1998, however, the Company has been diversifying its loan portfolio through the expansion of its commercial and construction loan portfolios. At March 31, 2018, commercial and construction loans represented 87.1% of total loans. Commercial lending, including commercial real estate loans, typically has higher credit risk, greater interest margins and shorter terms than residential lending which can increase the loan portfolio's profitability.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 totaled $1.9 million, a $127,000 or 7.29% increase from $1.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense related to variable rate subordinated debentures, which repriced quarterly based on the three-month LIBOR, and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The weighted average interest rate on other interest-bearing liabilities increased to 2.76% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 2.27% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $56.0 million to $628.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to $572.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on interest-bearing deposits decreased to 0.18% for fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 from 0.20% for the prior fiscal year.\nOperating Strategy\nIn addition, REO is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, if applicable. Management generally determines fair value based on a number of factors, including third-party appraisals of fair value less estimated costs to sell. The valuation of REO is subject to significant external and internal judgment, and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates.\nIn accordance with GAAP, loans acquired from MBank were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loans' contractual amounts, of which a portion reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value and as a result no allowance for loan losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. The discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or related allowance coverage ratios. However, we believe it should be considered when comparing certain financial ratios of the Company calculated in periods after the MBank transaction, compared to the same financial ratios of the Company in periods prior to the MBank transaction. See Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. At March 31, 2018, the Company had an allowance for loan losses of $10.8 million, or 1.33% of total loans, compared to $10.5 million, or 1.35% at March 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 totaled $2.3 million, a $480,000 or 25.7% increase from $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense related to variable rate subordinated debentures, which repriced quarterly based on the three-month LIBOR, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits due primarily to the MBank transaction. The weighted average interest rate on other interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.85% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 2.76% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $85.0 million to $714.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to $628.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The weighted average interest rate on interest-bearing deposits decreased to 0.17% for fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from 0.18% for the prior fiscal year.\nThe Company's goal is to deliver returns to shareholders by increasing higher-yielding assets (in particular, commercial real estate and commercial business loans), increasing core deposit balances, managing problem assets, reducing expenses, hiring experienced employees with a commercial lending focus and exploring expansion opportunities. The Company seeks to achieve these results by focusing on the following objectives:\nThe Company's mortgage servicing activities provide additional protection from interest rate risk. The Company retains servicing rights on all mortgage loans sold. As market interest rates rise, the fixed-rate loans held in the loan portfolio diminish in value. However, the value of the servicing loan portfolio tends to rise as market interest rates increase because borrowers tend not to prepay the underlying mortgages, thus providing an interest rate risk hedge versus the fixed-rate loan portfolio. See \"Item 1. Business - Lending Activities - Mortgage Loan Servicing.\"\nThe Company's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the sale of loans, maturing securities, FHLB advances and FRB borrowings. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and prepayment of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Management believes that its focus on core relationship deposits coupled with access to borrowing through reliable counterparties provides reasonable and prudent assurance that ample liquidity is available. However, depositor or counterparty behavior could change in response to competition, economic or market situations or other unforeseen circumstances, which could have liquidity implications that may require different strategic or operational actions.\n\n(1) Interest on municipal securities is presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis.\nEstimated Fair Value of Level 3 Assets\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage, commercial and consumer loans. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company's maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to originate loans are conditional and are honored for up to 45 days subject to the Company's usual terms and conditions. Collateral is not required to support commitments.\nThe Company has adopted a strategy that is designed to maintain or improve the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities. The primary elements of this strategy involve: the origination of adjustable rate loans; increasing commercial loans, consumer loans that are adjustable rate and other short-term loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one-to-four family residential mortgage loans; matching asset and liability maturities; investing in short-term securities; and selling most long term, fixed-rate, one-to-four family mortgage loan originations. The strategy for liabilities has been to shorten the maturities for both deposits and borrowings. The longer-term objective is to increase the proportion of noninterest bearing demand deposits, low interest bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings deposits relative to certificates of deposit to reduce our overall cost of funds.\nIt is possible that changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management's judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill, could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of our goodwill. If the Company recorded an impairment charge, its financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected; however, such an impairment charge would have no impact on our liquidity, operations or regulatory capital.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $1.0 million to $11.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 from $10.0 million for fiscal year 2017. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to the increase in fees and service charges and asset management fees of $602,000 and $460,000, respectively. Other non-interest income for the year ended March 31, 2017 included a $240,000 OTTI charge related to a collateralized debt obligation security which was not present for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor additional information on our Level 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe average balance of net loans increased $69.7 million to $663.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 from $593.4 million for the prior fiscal year. The average yield on net loans was 4.77% for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 4.68% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of investment securities increased $41.4 million to $175.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to $134.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nIntroduction of New Products and Services. The Company continuously reviews new products and services to provide its customers more financial options. All new technology and services are generally reviewed for business development and cost saving purposes. The Company continues to experience growth in customer use of its online banking services, where the Bank provides a full array of traditional cash management products as well as online banking products including mobile banking, mobile deposit, bill pay, e-statements, and text banking. The products are tailored to meet the needs of small to medium size businesses and households in the markets we serve. The Bank has implemented remote check capture at all of its branches and for selected customers of the Bank. The Company also intends to selectively add other products to further diversify revenue sources and to capture more of each customer's banking relationship by cross selling loan and deposit products and additional services to Bank customers, including services provided through the Trust Company to increase its fee income. Assets under management by the Trust Company totaled $484.3 million and $425.9 million at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Beginning in November 2017, the Company began offering a third-party identity theft product to its customers. The identity theft product assists our customers in monitoring their credit and includes an identity theft restoration service. In December 2016, the Company switched its existing debit card holders from Visa\u00ae to MasterCard\u00ae. The change in debit card service providers increased interchange revenue and has provided cost savings to the Company.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company's operations. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $2.6 million to $35.6 million for fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to $33.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior fiscal year partially due to the reorganization of various departments due to retirements and also due to additional staffing as a result of the MBank transaction. Occupancy and depreciation, amortization of CDI and data processing expense increased $635,000, $205,000 and $202,000, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the MBank transaction. The Company incurred an entire year of increased cost in the fiscal year 2018 due to the MBank transaction, compared to incurring approximately two months of related cost in the fiscal year 2017. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in professional fees of $447,000 for the fiscal year 2018 compared to the fiscal year 2017, primarily due to $653,000 in professional fees incurred in the fiscal year 2017 related to the MBank transaction. In addition, non-interest expense for fiscal year 2017 included litigation settlement costs related to an REO property of $500,000 which was not present for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nNet recoveries for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $238,000 and $643,000, respectively. Net recoveries to average net loans for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were (0.03)% and (0.10)%, respectively. Nonperforming loans at March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $2.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to 445.24% at March 31, 2018 compared to 382.98% at March 31, 2017.\nProvision for Loan Losses. There was no provision for or recapture of loan losses for the fiscal year 2017 as a result of adequate reserves already in place and overall net recoveries. The recapture of loan losses totaled $1.2 million for the fiscal year ended 2016. The recapture of loan losses for fiscal year 2016 was primarily a result of a decrease in charge-offs and the decline in the level of delinquent, nonperforming and classified loans, as well as the stabilization of real estate values in our market areas.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $639,000 to $10.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 from $9.4 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to the increase in fees and service charges and net gains on sales of loans held for sale of $331,000 and $131,000, respectively. Additionally, other non-interest income in fiscal year 2017 increased $411,000 due primarily to a BOLI death benefit on a former employee of $423,000. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in asset management fees of $224,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. Other non-interest income for the year ended March 31, 2017 included a $240,000 OTTI charge related to a collateralized debt obligation security which was not present for the year ended March 31, 2016. Additionally, losses on sales of REO, which is included in other non-interest income, decreased $182,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $3.0 million to $33.0 million for fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to $29.9 million for fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year partially due to additional staffing as a result of the MBank transaction. Professional fees increased $724,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to $653,000 in professional fees incurred related to the MBank transaction. Data processing expense increased $336,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting additional costs required to operate an additional core banking system as well as costs for conversion and integration of the two core banking systems associated with the MBank transaction. Litigation settlement costs related to an REO property increased $400,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year as the litigation was concluded in fiscal year 2017. In addition, advertising and marketing expense increased $85,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in REO expenses (which include operating costs and write-downs on property) of $513,000 for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in REO balances as well as the stabilization of real estate values in the Company's market area. In addition, the Company's FDIC insurance premiums also decreased $144,000 compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting a decrease in the Bank's FDIC assessment rates.\nThe Company must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds for loan originations, deposit withdrawals and continuing operations, satisfy other financial commitments and take advantage of investment opportunities. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Bank used its sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments and purchase additional investment securities. At March 31, 2018, cash and available for sale investments totaled $264.0 million, or 22.9% of total assets. The Bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short-term investments to meet short-term liquidity needs; however, its primary liquidity management practice is to increase or decrease short-term borrowings, including FRB borrowings and FHLB advances. At March 31, 2018, the Bank had no advances from the FRB and had a borrowing capacity of $57.4 million from the FRB, subject to sufficient collateral. At March 31, 2018, there were no advances from the FHLB and the Bank had an available borrowing capacity of $279.0 million, subject to sufficient collateral and stock investment. At March 31, 2018, the Bank had sufficient unpledged collateral to allow it to utilize its available borrowing capacity from the FRB and the FHLB. Borrowing capacity may, however, fluctuate based on acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion.\nNet Interest Income. The Company's profitability depends primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the income it receives on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. When the rate earned on interest-earning assets equals or exceeds the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, this positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income. The Company's results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, government legislation and regulation, and monetary and fiscal policies.\nExecution of our Business Plan. The Company is focused on increasing its loan portfolio, especially higher yielding commercial and construction loans, and its core deposits by expanding its customer base throughout its primary market areas. By emphasizing total relationship banking, the Company intends to deepen the relationships with its customers and increase individual customer profitability through cross-marketing programs, which allows the Company to better identify lending opportunities and services for customers. To build its core deposit base, the Company will continue to utilize additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. The Company will also continue to seek to expand its franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and whole bank transactions that meet its investment and market objectives, such as the February 2017 MBank transaction.\nNet interest income for fiscal year 2018 increased $8.9 million, or 26.2%, to $42.6 million compared to $33.8 million in fiscal year 2017. The net interest margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was 4.08% compared to 3.79% for the prior fiscal year. This increase in the net interest margin was primarily the result of the increase in the average balance of loans receivable as a result of organic loan growth, purchased guaranteed portions of SBA loans and acquired loans as part of the MBank transaction. In addition, the increase in net interest margin was also attributable to the increase in investment securities.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $3.4 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The effective tax rate was 31.4% for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 34.8% for the year ended March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, management deemed that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the Company's deferred tax asset was not necessary. At March 31, 2017, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $7.6 million which included $1.1 million for federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.\nRate/Volume Analysis\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn additional source of wholesale funding includes brokered certificates of deposit. While the Company has utilized brokered deposits from time to time, the Company historically has not extensively relied on brokered deposits to fund its operations. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank had no wholesale brokered deposits. The Bank also participates in the CDARS and ICS deposit products, which allow the Company to accept deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit for that depositor and obtain \"pass-through\" insurance for the total deposit. The Bank's CDARS and ICS balances were $23.6 million, or 2.4% of total deposits, and $24.3 million, or 2.5% of total deposits, at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, the Bank is enrolled in an internet deposit listing service. Under this listing service, the Bank may post time deposit rates on an internet site where institutional investors have the ability to deposit funds with the Bank. At March 31, 2018, the Company had no deposits through this listing service. At March 31, 2017, the Company had $7.0 million of deposits through this listing service which were assumed in the MBank transaction. Although the Company did not originate any internet based deposits during the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company may do so in the future consistent with its asset/liability objectives. The combination of all the Bank's funding sources gives the Bank available liquidity of $767.4 million, or 66.6% of total assets at March 31, 2018.\nLiquidity management is both a short and long-term responsibility of the Company's management. The Company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management's assessment of (i) expected loan demand, (ii) projected loan sales, (iii) expected deposit flows, (iv) yields available on interest-bearing deposits and (v) its asset/liability management program objectives. Excess liquidity is invested generally in interest-bearing overnight deposits and other short-term government and agency obligations. If the Company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, it has additional diversified and reliable sources of funds with the FHLB, the FRB and other wholesale facilities. These sources of funds may be used on a long or short-term basis to compensate for a reduction in other sources of funds or on a long-term basis to support lending activities.\nThe Company may also invest in short-term to medium-term U.S. Government securities as well as mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies. At March 31, 2018, the combined investment portfolio carried at $213.3 million had an average life of 4.9 years. Adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities totaled $17.8 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $10.2 million at March 31, 2017. See Item 1. \"Business - Investment Activities.\"\nImpaired loans are subjected to an impairment analysis to determine an appropriate reserve amount to be held against each loan. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had identified $7.7 million of impaired loans. Because the significant majority of the impaired loans are collateral dependent, nearly all of the specific allowances are calculated based on the estimated fair value of the collateral. Of those impaired loans, $6.6 million have no specific valuation allowance as their estimated collateral value is equal to or exceeds the carrying amount of the loan, which in some cases is the result of previous loan charge-offs. The remaining $1.1 million have specific valuation allowances totaling $69,000. Charge-offs on these impaired loans totaled $83,000 from their original loan balances. Based on a comprehensive analysis, management deemed the allowance for loan losses of $10.8 million at March 31, 2018 adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses.\nEven though the Company determined that there was no goodwill impairment, a decline in the value of its stock price as well as values of other financial institutions, declines in revenue for the Company beyond our current forecasts, significant adverse changes in the operating environment for the financial industry or an increase in the value of our assets without an increase in the value of the reporting unit may result in a future impairment charge.\nMaintaining Strong Asset Quality. The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The Company has actively managed the delinquent loans and nonperforming assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts, marketing saleable properties upon foreclosure or repossession, and through work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. In the past several years, the Company has applied more conservative and stringent underwriting practices to new loans, including, among other things, increasing the amount of required collateral or equity requirements, reducing loan-to-value ratios and increasing debt service coverage ratios resulting in improved credit metrics/asset quality. Although the Company intends to prudently increase the percentage of its assets consisting of higher-yielding commercial real estate, real estate construction and commercial business loans, which offer higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the Company intends to manage credit exposure through the use of experienced bankers in these areas and a conservative approach to its lending.\nImplementation of a Profit Improvement Plan (\"PIP\"). The Company has formed a committee comprised of several members of management and the Board of Directors to undertake several initiatives to reduce non-interest expense and continue its on-going efforts to identify cost saving opportunities throughout all aspects of the Company's operations. The PIP committee's mission is not only to find additional cost saving opportunities but also to search for and implement revenue enhancements and additional areas for improvement. The Company has instituted expense control measures such as cancelling certain projects and capital purchases, and reducing travel and entertainment and other noninterest expenditures. As a result, the Company has improved its efficiency ratio over the last several years from 98.0% at March 31, 2014 to 66.4% at March 31, 2018.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016", "item_7_text": "Net Income. Net income was $10.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2018, compared to $7.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2017. The earnings for the year ended March 31, 2018 improved due to an increase in net interest income and non-interest income, which was partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense primarily as a result of the MBank transaction. In addition, net income for the year ended March 31, 2018 was negatively affected due to the impact of the federal corporate income tax rate change included in the Tax Act, which resulted in a $1.6 million net increase to the Company's provision for income taxes. This one-time charge to the provision for income taxes was due to the Company revaluing its deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the lower enacted federal corporate income tax rate at which the Company expects to recognize the benefit and was offset by the benefit resulting from the use of an overall lower blended federal corporate income tax rate.\nGeneral\nShareholders' equity increased $5.6 million to $116.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $111.3 million at March 31, 2017. The increase was mainly attributable to net income of $10.2 million. The increase was partially offset by cash dividends declared of $2.4 million and an increase in other comprehensive loss related to unrealized holding loss on securities available for sale, of $3.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nThe average balance of net loans increased $126.1 million to $789.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from $663.1 million for the prior fiscal year. The average yield on net loans was 5.03% for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 4.77% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of investment securities increased $38.9 million to $214.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to $175.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2017.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $7.8 million and $3.4 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate was 43.1% for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 31.4% for the year ended March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $4.8 million. The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate was higher for the fiscal year 2018 compared to the fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a net charge to the provision for income taxes of $1.6 million. This one-time charge to the provision for income taxes was the result of the enactment of the Tax Act, which required the Company to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the lower enacted federal corporate income tax rate at which the Company expects to recognize the benefit and was offset by the benefit resulting from the use of an overall lower blended federal corporate income tax rate. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company utilized a blended tax rate of 30.8% for the fiscal year 2018. As of March 31, 2018, management deemed that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the Company's deferred tax asset was not necessary. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.\nAttracting Core Deposits and Other Deposit Products. The Company offers personal checking, savings and money-market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less likely to be withdrawn when interest rates fluctuate. To build its core deposit base, the Company has sought to reduce its dependence on traditional higher cost deposits in favor of stable lower cost core deposits to fund loan growth and decrease its reliance on other wholesale funding sources, including FHLB and FRB advances. The Company believes that its continued focus on building customer relationships will help to increase the level of core deposits and locally-based retail certificates of deposit. In addition, the Company intends to increase demand deposits by growing business banking relationships through expanded product lines tailored to meet its target business customers' needs. The Company maintains technology-based products to encourage the growth of lower cost deposits, such as personal financial management, business cash management, and business remote deposit products, that enable it to meet its customers' cash management needs and compete effectively with banks of all sizes. Core branch deposits increased $22.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017, reflecting organic deposit growth.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. The objective of the Bank's liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals, to fund the borrowing needs of loan customers, and to fund ongoing operations. Core relationship deposits are the primary source of the Bank's liquidity. As such, the Bank focuses on deposit relationships with local consumer and business clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the Bank.\nRecruiting and Retaining Highly Competent Personnel with a Focus on Commercial Lending. The Company's ability to continue to attract and retain banking professionals with strong community relationships and significant knowledge of its markets will be a key to its success. The Company believes that it enhances its market position and adds profitable growth opportunities by focusing on hiring and retaining experienced bankers focused on owner occupied commercial real estate and commercial lending, and the deposit balances that accompany these relationships. The Company emphasizes to its employees the importance of delivering exemplary customer service and seeking opportunities to build further relationships with its customers. The goal is to compete with other financial service providers by relying on the strength of the Company's customer service and relationship banking approach. The Company believes that one of its strengths is that its employees are also shareholders through the Company's employee stock ownership (\"ESOP\") and 401(k) plans.\nGoodwill was $27.1 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017. For the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter ended December 31, 2017 and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. For additional information on our goodwill impairment testing, see \"Goodwill Valuation\" included in this Item 7.\nThe Company is periodically a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, these actions will not have a material adverse effect, if any, on the Company's future financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. The Bank has entered into employment contracts with certain key employees, which provide for contingent payment subject to future events.\nGoodwill Valuation\nThe Company determines the estimated fair value of certain assets that are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established under GAAP. These Level 3 assets are valued using significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the estimated fair value of the assets. These Level 3 assets include certain loans measured for impairment and REO for which there is neither an active market for identical assets from which to determine fair value, nor is there sufficient, current market information about similar assets to use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs in a valuation model. Under these circumstances, the estimated fair values of these assets are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, appraisals, and other valuation methods in accordance with accounting standards, for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nDeposits increased $15.6 million to $995.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $980.1 million at March 31, 2017. The increase is the result of continued organic deposit growth. The Company had no wholesale-brokered deposits at March 31, 2018 and 2017. Core branch deposits accounted for 98.3% of total deposits at March 31, 2018 compared to 97.6% at March 31, 2017. The Company plans to continue its focus on core deposits and on building customer relationships as opposed to obtaining deposits through the wholesale markets.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased to $45.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from $35.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 due primarily to increases in interest from loans receivable and investment securities of $8.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. These increases were primarily due to higher average balances for both loans receivable and investment securities as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIn accordance with GAAP, loans acquired from MBank were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loans' contractual amounts, of which a portion reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value and as a result no allowance for loan losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. The discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or related allowance coverage ratios. However, we believe it should be considered when comparing certain financial ratios of the Company calculated in periods after the MBank transaction, compared to the same financial ratios of the Company in periods prior to the MBank transaction. At March 31, 2017, the Company had an allowance for loan losses of $10.5 million, or 1.35% of total loans, compared to $9.9 million, or 1.58% at March 31, 2016. See Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had commercial loan commitments of $1.8 million and undisbursed commercial lines of credit of $48.8 million. Commercial real estate mortgage loan commitments totaled $2.7 million and the undisbursed balance of commercial real estate mortgage loans was $11.1 million at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, construction loan commitments totaled $23.8 million and undisbursed construction loans totaled $72.0 million. Unused lines of credit secured by land development loans totaled $2.8 million. Unused lines of credit secured by multi-family loans totaled $394,000. Real estate one-to-four family loan commitments totaled $6.6 million and unused lines of credit secured by real estate one-to-four family loans totaled $16.7 million at March 31, 2018. Other installment loan commitments totaled $220,000 and unused lines of credit on other installment loans totaled $1.2 million at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, the Company had standby letters of credit totaling $2.4 million. For additional information regarding future financial commitments, this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCash and cash equivalents, including interest-earning accounts, totaled $44.8 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $64.6 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in cash balances was primarily the result of funding the increase in loans receivable and investment securities. The Company has deployed a portion of its excess cash balances into investment securities to earn higher yields than the nominal yield earned on cash held in interest-earning accounts based on its asset/liability management program and liquidity objectives in order to maximize earnings. As a part of this strategy, the Company also invests a portion of its excess cash in short-term certificates of deposit held for investment. All of the certificates of deposit held for investment are fully insured by the FDIC. At March 31, 2018, certificates of deposits held for investment totaled $6.0 million compared to $11.0 million at March 31, 2017.\nLoans receivable, net, totaled $800.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $768.9 million at March 31, 2017, an increase of $31.7 million. The Company has had steady loan demand in its market areas and anticipates continuing organic loan growth. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate, either as primary or secondary collateral, located in the Company's primary market areas. Risks associated with loans secured by real estate include decreases in land and property values, increases in interest rates, deterioration in local economic conditions, tightening credit or refinancing markets, and a geographic concentration of loans. The Company has no option adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) or teaser residential real estate loans in its loan portfolio.\nImpaired loans are subjected to an impairment analysis to determine an appropriate reserve amount to be held against each loan. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had identified $11.9 million of impaired loans. Because the significant majority of the impaired loans are collateral dependent, nearly all of the specific allowances are calculated based on the estimated fair value of the collateral. Of those impaired loans, $10.7 million have no specific valuation allowance as their estimated collateral value is equal to or exceeds the carrying amount of the loan, which in some cases is the result of previous loan charge-offs. The remaining $1.2 million have specific valuation allowances totaling $88,000. Charge-offs on these impaired loans totaled $83,000 from their original loan balances. Based on a comprehensive analysis, management deemed the allowance for loan losses of $10.5 million at March 31, 2017 adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses.\nThe Company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has identified policies that due to judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of investment securities, the valuation of REO and foreclosed assets, goodwill valuation and the calculation of income taxes. These policies and the judgments, estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In particular, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" describes generally the Company's accounting policies. Management believes that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\nA significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for fiscal year 2017 increased $4.6 million, or 15.6%, to $33.8 million compared to $29.2 million in fiscal year 2016. The net interest margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was 3.79% compared to 3.67% for the prior fiscal year. This increase in the net interest margin was primarily the result of the increase in the average balance of loans receivable and investment securities.\nAverage Balance Sheet. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income earned on average interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spread, ratio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities and net interest margin. Average balances for a period have been calculated using monthly average balances during such period. Non-accruing loans were included in the average loan amounts outstanding. Loan fees, net, of $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $980,000 were included in interest income for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProvision for Loan Losses. There was no provision for or recapture of loan losses for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 as a result of adequate reserves already in place and net recoveries, as well as the stabilization in the level of delinquent, nonperforming and classified loans, and the stabilization of real estate values in our market areas.\nAt March 31, 2018, scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit, future operating minimum lease commitments, capital lease obligations and subordinated debentures were as follows (in thousands):\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNet recoveries for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $643,000 and $273,000, respectively. Net recoveries to average net loans for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were (0.10)% and (0.05)%, respectively. Nonperforming loans remained at $2.7 million at both March 31, 2017 and 2016. The allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to 382.98% at March 31, 2017 compared to 364.22% at March 31, 2016.\nBeginning in March 2017, the Company periodically began purchasing the guaranteed portion of SBA loans as a way to supplement loan originations, further diversify its loan portfolio and earn a higher yield than earned on its cash or short-term investments. These SBA loans are originated through another financial institution located outside the Company's primary market area. These loans are purchased with servicing retained by the seller. At March 31, 2018, the Company's purchased SBA loan portfolio was $47.0 million compared to $5.6 million at March 31, 2017. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Bank purchased $42.8 million of SBA loans, including premiums.\nConsumer loans, such as home equity lines of credit and installment loans, commercial loans and construction loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans, and accordingly reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Adjustable interest rate loans totaled $477.1 million or 58.80% of total loans at March 31, 2018 as compared to $490.6 million or 62.95% at March 31, 2017. Although the Company has sought to originate adjustable rate loans, the ability to originate and purchase such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers' preferences. Particularly in lower interest rate environments, borrowers often prefer to obtain fixed-rate loans. See Item 1. \"Business - Lending Activities - Real Estate Construction \" and \"- Lending Activities - Consumer Lending.\"\nInvestment securities totaled $213.3 million and $200.3 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was due to a decision by the Company to invest additional excess cash into higher yielding investment securities. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company purchased $47.5 million of investment securities. The Company primarily purchases a combination of securities backed by government agencies (FHLMC, FNMA, SBA or GNMA). At March 31, 2018, the Company determined that none of its investment securities required an OTTI charge. For additional information on the Company's investment securities, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had total commitments of $190.5 million, which includes commitments to extend credit of $35.1 million, unused lines of credit totaling $81.0 million, undisbursed construction loans totaling $72.0 million, and standby letters of credit totaling $2.4 million. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from March 31, 2018 totaled $88.9 million. Historically, the Bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature. Offsetting these cash outflows are scheduled loan maturities of less than one year totaling $67.6 million at March 31, 2018.\nThe Company's principal financial objective is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates. The Company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates. The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity increases by retaining portfolio loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and selling fixed-rate one-to-four family mortgage loans with terms to maturity of more than 15 years. The Company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds. Management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a stable source of funds. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms up to ten years.\nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their impact on the Company, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCertain loans included in the loan portfolio were deemed impaired at March 31, 2018. Accordingly, loans measured for impairment were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as there is no active market for these loans. Measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates, and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates. Impairment was measured based on a number of factors, including recent independent appraisals which are further reduced for estimated selling costs or by estimating the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate.\nThe following table shows the contractual obligations by expected period. Further discussion of commitments is included in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2017. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. Step one of the goodwill impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing the allocation of corporate value approach, the income approach and the market approach in order to derive an enterprise value of the Company. The allocation of corporate value approach applies the aggregate market value of the Company and divides it among the reporting units. A key assumption in this approach is the control premium applied to the aggregate market value. A control premium is utilized as the value of a company from the perspective of a controlling interest is generally higher than the widely quoted market price per share. The Company used an expected control premium of 30%, which was based on comparable transactional history. The income approach uses a reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a rate that reflects current market conditions. The projection uses management's best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in loans and deposits, estimates of future expected changes in net interest margins and cash expenditures. Assumptions used by the Company in its discounted cash flow model (income approach) included an annual revenue growth rate that approximated 6.9%, a net interest margin that approximated 4.3% and a return on assets that ranged from 1.17% to 1.38% (average of 1.27%). In addition to utilizing the above projections of estimated operating results, key assumptions used to determine the fair value estimate under the income approach were the discount rate of 14.26% utilized for our cash flow estimates and a terminal value estimated at 1.8 times the ending book value of the reporting unit. The Company used a build-up approach in developing the discount rate that included: an assessment of the risk free interest rate, the rate of return expected from publicly traded stocks, the industry the Company operates in and the size of the Company. The market approach estimates fair value by applying tangible book value multiples to the reporting unit's operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting unit. In applying the market approach method, the Company selected four publicly traded comparable institutions. After selecting comparable institutions, the Company derived the fair value of the reporting unit by completing a comparative analysis of the relationship between their financial metrics listed above and their market values utilizing a market multiple of 1.5 times tangible book value. The Company calculated a fair value of its reporting unit of $265.0 million using the corporate value approach, $196.5 million using the income approach and $275.0 million using the market approach, with a final concluded value of $250.0 million, with primary weight given to the market approach. The results of the Company's step one test indicated that the reporting unit's fair value was greater than its carrying value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists.\nValuations using models or other techniques are dependent upon assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of the valuation date. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. Judgment is then applied in formulating those inputs.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased to $35.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 from $30.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 due primarily to increases in interest from loans receivable and investment securities of $3.8 million and $866,000, respectively. These increases were primarily due to higher average balances for both loans receivable and investment securities as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet Income. Net income was $7.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2017, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2016. The earnings for the year ended March 31, 2017 improved due to an increase in net interest income and non-interest income, which was partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. In addition, net income for the year ended March 31, 2017 did not include any provision or recapture of loan loss compared to a recapture of loan losses of $1.2 million for the prior fiscal year.\ncarrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and additional analysis must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, the Company would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, the Company would record an impairment charge for the difference.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the other sections contained in this Form 10-K. This section contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. These measures include net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company's performance. The tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. As a result of the enactment on December 21, 2017 of the Tax Act, which reduced the federal income tax rate for corporations from a maximum of 35% to 21%, the Company utilized a blended tax rate of 30.8% to calculate the tax equivalent adjustment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis, and accordingly believes that providing these measures may be useful for peer comparison purposes. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for the results determined to be in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on net interest income of the Company for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Information is provided with respect to: (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) changes in rate/volume (change in rate multiplied by change in volume). Variances that were insignificant have been allocated based upon the percentage relationship of changes in volume and changes in rate to the total net change (in thousands). The changes noted in the table below include tax equivalent adjustments, and as a result, will not agree to the amounts reflected on the Company's consolidated statements of income for the categories that have been adjusted to reflect tax equivalent income.\nGoodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested, at least annually, for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company has two reporting units, the Bank and the Trust Company, for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment. All of the Company's goodwill has been allocated to the Bank reporting unit. The Company performs an annual review in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist, to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary. If the\nAsset and Liability Management\nComparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2018 and 2017\nRiverview Bancorp, Inc., as a separate legal entity from the Bank, must provide for its own liquidity. Sources of capital and liquidity for Riverview Bancorp, Inc. include distributions from the Bank and the issuance of debt or equity securities. Dividends and other capital distributions from the Bank are subject to regulatory notice. At March 31, 2018, Riverview Bancorp, Inc. had $6.5 million in cash to meet liquidity needs.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nContractual Obligations\nFiscal year 2018 marked the 95th anniversary since the Bank began operations in 1923. The primary business strategy of the Company is to provide comprehensive banking and related financial services within its primary market area. The historical emphasis had previously been on residential real estate lending. Since 1998, however, the Company has been diversifying its loan portfolio through the expansion of its commercial and construction loan portfolios. At March 31, 2018, commercial and construction loans represented 87.1% of total loans. Commercial lending, including commercial real estate loans, typically has higher credit risk, greater interest margins and shorter terms than residential lending which can increase the loan portfolio's profitability.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 totaled $1.9 million, a $127,000 or 7.29% increase from $1.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense related to variable rate subordinated debentures, which repriced quarterly based on the three-month LIBOR, and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The weighted average interest rate on other interest-bearing liabilities increased to 2.76% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 2.27% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $56.0 million to $628.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to $572.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on interest-bearing deposits decreased to 0.18% for fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 from 0.20% for the prior fiscal year.\nOperating Strategy\nIn addition, REO is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, if applicable. Management generally determines fair value based on a number of factors, including third-party appraisals of fair value less estimated costs to sell. The valuation of REO is subject to significant external and internal judgment, and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates.\nIn accordance with GAAP, loans acquired from MBank were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loans' contractual amounts, of which a portion reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value and as a result no allowance for loan losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. The discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or related allowance coverage ratios. However, we believe it should be considered when comparing certain financial ratios of the Company calculated in periods after the MBank transaction, compared to the same financial ratios of the Company in periods prior to the MBank transaction. See Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. At March 31, 2018, the Company had an allowance for loan losses of $10.8 million, or 1.33% of total loans, compared to $10.5 million, or 1.35% at March 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 totaled $2.3 million, a $480,000 or 25.7% increase from $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense related to variable rate subordinated debentures, which repriced quarterly based on the three-month LIBOR, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits due primarily to the MBank transaction. The weighted average interest rate on other interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.85% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to 2.76% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $85.0 million to $714.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to $628.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The weighted average interest rate on interest-bearing deposits decreased to 0.17% for fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from 0.18% for the prior fiscal year.\nThe Company's goal is to deliver returns to shareholders by increasing higher-yielding assets (in particular, commercial real estate and commercial business loans), increasing core deposit balances, managing problem assets, reducing expenses, hiring experienced employees with a commercial lending focus and exploring expansion opportunities. The Company seeks to achieve these results by focusing on the following objectives:\nThe Company's mortgage servicing activities provide additional protection from interest rate risk. The Company retains servicing rights on all mortgage loans sold. As market interest rates rise, the fixed-rate loans held in the loan portfolio diminish in value. However, the value of the servicing loan portfolio tends to rise as market interest rates increase because borrowers tend not to prepay the underlying mortgages, thus providing an interest rate risk hedge versus the fixed-rate loan portfolio. See \"Item 1. Business - Lending Activities - Mortgage Loan Servicing.\"\nThe Company's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the sale of loans, maturing securities, FHLB advances and FRB borrowings. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and prepayment of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Management believes that its focus on core relationship deposits coupled with access to borrowing through reliable counterparties provides reasonable and prudent assurance that ample liquidity is available. However, depositor or counterparty behavior could change in response to competition, economic or market situations or other unforeseen circumstances, which could have liquidity implications that may require different strategic or operational actions.\n\n(1) Interest on municipal securities is presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis.\nEstimated Fair Value of Level 3 Assets\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage, commercial and consumer loans. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company's maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to originate loans are conditional and are honored for up to 45 days subject to the Company's usual terms and conditions. Collateral is not required to support commitments.\nThe Company has adopted a strategy that is designed to maintain or improve the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities. The primary elements of this strategy involve: the origination of adjustable rate loans; increasing commercial loans, consumer loans that are adjustable rate and other short-term loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one-to-four family residential mortgage loans; matching asset and liability maturities; investing in short-term securities; and selling most long term, fixed-rate, one-to-four family mortgage loan originations. The strategy for liabilities has been to shorten the maturities for both deposits and borrowings. The longer-term objective is to increase the proportion of noninterest bearing demand deposits, low interest bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings deposits relative to certificates of deposit to reduce our overall cost of funds.\nIt is possible that changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management's judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill, could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of our goodwill. If the Company recorded an impairment charge, its financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected; however, such an impairment charge would have no impact on our liquidity, operations or regulatory capital.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $1.0 million to $11.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 from $10.0 million for fiscal year 2017. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to the increase in fees and service charges and asset management fees of $602,000 and $460,000, respectively. Other non-interest income for the year ended March 31, 2017 included a $240,000 OTTI charge related to a collateralized debt obligation security which was not present for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor additional information on our Level 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe average balance of net loans increased $69.7 million to $663.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 from $593.4 million for the prior fiscal year. The average yield on net loans was 4.77% for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 4.68% for the prior fiscal year. The average balance of investment securities increased $41.4 million to $175.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to $134.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nIntroduction of New Products and Services. The Company continuously reviews new products and services to provide its customers more financial options. All new technology and services are generally reviewed for business development and cost saving purposes. The Company continues to experience growth in customer use of its online banking services, where the Bank provides a full array of traditional cash management products as well as online banking products including mobile banking, mobile deposit, bill pay, e-statements, and text banking. The products are tailored to meet the needs of small to medium size businesses and households in the markets we serve. The Bank has implemented remote check capture at all of its branches and for selected customers of the Bank. The Company also intends to selectively add other products to further diversify revenue sources and to capture more of each customer's banking relationship by cross selling loan and deposit products and additional services to Bank customers, including services provided through the Trust Company to increase its fee income. Assets under management by the Trust Company totaled $484.3 million and $425.9 million at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Beginning in November 2017, the Company began offering a third-party identity theft product to its customers. The identity theft product assists our customers in monitoring their credit and includes an identity theft restoration service. In December 2016, the Company switched its existing debit card holders from Visa\u00ae to MasterCard\u00ae. The change in debit card service providers increased interchange revenue and has provided cost savings to the Company.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company's operations. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $2.6 million to $35.6 million for fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to $33.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior fiscal year partially due to the reorganization of various departments due to retirements and also due to additional staffing as a result of the MBank transaction. Occupancy and depreciation, amortization of CDI and data processing expense increased $635,000, $205,000 and $202,000, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the MBank transaction. The Company incurred an entire year of increased cost in the fiscal year 2018 due to the MBank transaction, compared to incurring approximately two months of related cost in the fiscal year 2017. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in professional fees of $447,000 for the fiscal year 2018 compared to the fiscal year 2017, primarily due to $653,000 in professional fees incurred in the fiscal year 2017 related to the MBank transaction. In addition, non-interest expense for fiscal year 2017 included litigation settlement costs related to an REO property of $500,000 which was not present for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nNet recoveries for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $238,000 and $643,000, respectively. Net recoveries to average net loans for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were (0.03)% and (0.10)%, respectively. Nonperforming loans at March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $2.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to 445.24% at March 31, 2018 compared to 382.98% at March 31, 2017.\nProvision for Loan Losses. There was no provision for or recapture of loan losses for the fiscal year 2017 as a result of adequate reserves already in place and overall net recoveries. The recapture of loan losses totaled $1.2 million for the fiscal year ended 2016. The recapture of loan losses for fiscal year 2016 was primarily a result of a decrease in charge-offs and the decline in the level of delinquent, nonperforming and classified loans, as well as the stabilization of real estate values in our market areas.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $639,000 to $10.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 from $9.4 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to the increase in fees and service charges and net gains on sales of loans held for sale of $331,000 and $131,000, respectively. Additionally, other non-interest income in fiscal year 2017 increased $411,000 due primarily to a BOLI death benefit on a former employee of $423,000. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in asset management fees of $224,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. Other non-interest income for the year ended March 31, 2017 included a $240,000 OTTI charge related to a collateralized debt obligation security which was not present for the year ended March 31, 2016. Additionally, losses on sales of REO, which is included in other non-interest income, decreased $182,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $3.0 million to $33.0 million for fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to $29.9 million for fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year partially due to additional staffing as a result of the MBank transaction. Professional fees increased $724,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to $653,000 in professional fees incurred related to the MBank transaction. Data processing expense increased $336,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting additional costs required to operate an additional core banking system as well as costs for conversion and integration of the two core banking systems associated with the MBank transaction. Litigation settlement costs related to an REO property increased $400,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year as the litigation was concluded in fiscal year 2017. In addition, advertising and marketing expense increased $85,000 for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in REO expenses (which include operating costs and write-downs on property) of $513,000 for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in REO balances as well as the stabilization of real estate values in the Company's market area. In addition, the Company's FDIC insurance premiums also decreased $144,000 compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting a decrease in the Bank's FDIC assessment rates.\nThe Company must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds for loan originations, deposit withdrawals and continuing operations, satisfy other financial commitments and take advantage of investment opportunities. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Bank used its sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments and purchase additional investment securities. At March 31, 2018, cash and available for sale investments totaled $264.0 million, or 22.9% of total assets. The Bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short-term investments to meet short-term liquidity needs; however, its primary liquidity management practice is to increase or decrease short-term borrowings, including FRB borrowings and FHLB advances. At March 31, 2018, the Bank had no advances from the FRB and had a borrowing capacity of $57.4 million from the FRB, subject to sufficient collateral. At March 31, 2018, there were no advances from the FHLB and the Bank had an available borrowing capacity of $279.0 million, subject to sufficient collateral and stock investment. At March 31, 2018, the Bank had sufficient unpledged collateral to allow it to utilize its available borrowing capacity from the FRB and the FHLB. Borrowing capacity may, however, fluctuate based on acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion.\nNet Interest Income. The Company's profitability depends primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the income it receives on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. When the rate earned on interest-earning assets equals or exceeds the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, this positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income. The Company's results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, government legislation and regulation, and monetary and fiscal policies.\nExecution of our Business Plan. The Company is focused on increasing its loan portfolio, especially higher yielding commercial and construction loans, and its core deposits by expanding its customer base throughout its primary market areas. By emphasizing total relationship banking, the Company intends to deepen the relationships with its customers and increase individual customer profitability through cross-marketing programs, which allows the Company to better identify lending opportunities and services for customers. To build its core deposit base, the Company will continue to utilize additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. The Company will also continue to seek to expand its franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and whole bank transactions that meet its investment and market objectives, such as the February 2017 MBank transaction.\nNet interest income for fiscal year 2018 increased $8.9 million, or 26.2%, to $42.6 million compared to $33.8 million in fiscal year 2017. The net interest margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was 4.08% compared to 3.79% for the prior fiscal year. This increase in the net interest margin was primarily the result of the increase in the average balance of loans receivable as a result of organic loan growth, purchased guaranteed portions of SBA loans and acquired loans as part of the MBank transaction. In addition, the increase in net interest margin was also attributable to the increase in investment securities.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $3.4 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The effective tax rate was 31.4% for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 34.8% for the year ended March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, management deemed that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the Company's deferred tax asset was not necessary. At March 31, 2017, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $7.6 million which included $1.1 million for federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.\nRate/Volume Analysis\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn additional source of wholesale funding includes brokered certificates of deposit. While the Company has utilized brokered deposits from time to time, the Company historically has not extensively relied on brokered deposits to fund its operations. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank had no wholesale brokered deposits. The Bank also participates in the CDARS and ICS deposit products, which allow the Company to accept deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit for that depositor and obtain \"pass-through\" insurance for the total deposit. The Bank's CDARS and ICS balances were $23.6 million, or 2.4% of total deposits, and $24.3 million, or 2.5% of total deposits, at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, the Bank is enrolled in an internet deposit listing service. Under this listing service, the Bank may post time deposit rates on an internet site where institutional investors have the ability to deposit funds with the Bank. At March 31, 2018, the Company had no deposits through this listing service. At March 31, 2017, the Company had $7.0 million of deposits through this listing service which were assumed in the MBank transaction. Although the Company did not originate any internet based deposits during the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company may do so in the future consistent with its asset/liability objectives. The combination of all the Bank's funding sources gives the Bank available liquidity of $767.4 million, or 66.6% of total assets at March 31, 2018.\nLiquidity management is both a short and long-term responsibility of the Company's management. The Company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management's assessment of (i) expected loan demand, (ii) projected loan sales, (iii) expected deposit flows, (iv) yields available on interest-bearing deposits and (v) its asset/liability management program objectives. Excess liquidity is invested generally in interest-bearing overnight deposits and other short-term government and agency obligations. If the Company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, it has additional diversified and reliable sources of funds with the FHLB, the FRB and other wholesale facilities. These sources of funds may be used on a long or short-term basis to compensate for a reduction in other sources of funds or on a long-term basis to support lending activities.\nThe Company may also invest in short-term to medium-term U.S. Government securities as well as mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies. At March 31, 2018, the combined investment portfolio carried at $213.3 million had an average life of 4.9 years. Adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities totaled $17.8 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $10.2 million at March 31, 2017. See Item 1. \"Business - Investment Activities.\"\nImpaired loans are subjected to an impairment analysis to determine an appropriate reserve amount to be held against each loan. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had identified $7.7 million of impaired loans. Because the significant majority of the impaired loans are collateral dependent, nearly all of the specific allowances are calculated based on the estimated fair value of the collateral. Of those impaired loans, $6.6 million have no specific valuation allowance as their estimated collateral value is equal to or exceeds the carrying amount of the loan, which in some cases is the result of previous loan charge-offs. The remaining $1.1 million have specific valuation allowances totaling $69,000. Charge-offs on these impaired loans totaled $83,000 from their original loan balances. Based on a comprehensive analysis, management deemed the allowance for loan losses of $10.8 million at March 31, 2018 adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses.\nEven though the Company determined that there was no goodwill impairment, a decline in the value of its stock price as well as values of other financial institutions, declines in revenue for the Company beyond our current forecasts, significant adverse changes in the operating environment for the financial industry or an increase in the value of our assets without an increase in the value of the reporting unit may result in a future impairment charge.\nMaintaining Strong Asset Quality. The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The Company has actively managed the delinquent loans and nonperforming assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts, marketing saleable properties upon foreclosure or repossession, and through work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. In the past several years, the Company has applied more conservative and stringent underwriting practices to new loans, including, among other things, increasing the amount of required collateral or equity requirements, reducing loan-to-value ratios and increasing debt service coverage ratios resulting in improved credit metrics/asset quality. Although the Company intends to prudently increase the percentage of its assets consisting of higher-yielding commercial real estate, real estate construction and commercial business loans, which offer higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the Company intends to manage credit exposure through the use of experienced bankers in these areas and a conservative approach to its lending.\nImplementation of a Profit Improvement Plan (\"PIP\"). The Company has formed a committee comprised of several members of management and the Board of Directors to undertake several initiatives to reduce non-interest expense and continue its on-going efforts to identify cost saving opportunities throughout all aspects of the Company's operations. The PIP committee's mission is not only to find additional cost saving opportunities but also to search for and implement revenue enhancements and additional areas for improvement. The Company has instituted expense control measures such as cancelling certain projects and capital purchases, and reducing travel and entertainment and other noninterest expenditures. As a result, the Company has improved its efficiency ratio over the last several years from 98.0% at March 31, 2014 to 66.4% at March 31, 2018.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended

income was $10.2 million or $0.45 per diluted share for fiscal year 2018, up from $7.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share for fiscal year 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income and non-interest income.\n\nNet Interest Income \n- Net interest income increased 26.2% to $42.6 million in fiscal year 2018 from $33.8 million in fiscal year 2017, driven by loan growth and higher investment securities balances.
