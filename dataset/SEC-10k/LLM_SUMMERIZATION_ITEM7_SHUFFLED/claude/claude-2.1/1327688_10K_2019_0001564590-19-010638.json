Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is January 31, and we refer to our fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 as fiscal 2019, our fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 as fiscal 2018, and our fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 as fiscal 2017. All other references to years are references to calendar years.\nExecutive Overview\nOoma creates powerful connected experiences for businesses and consumers. Our smart cloud-based SaaS platform serves as a communications hub, which offers cloud-based communications solutions, smart security and other connected services. Our business and residential solutions deliver our proprietary PureVoice high-definition voice quality, advanced functionality and integration with mobile devices, at competitive pricing and value. Our platform helps create smart workplaces and homes by providing communications, monitoring, security, automation, productivity and networking infrastructure applications.\nWe drive the adoption of our platform by providing communications solutions to the large and growing markets for business, residential and mobile users, and then accelerate growth by offering new and innovative connected services to our user base. Our customers adopt our platform by making a one-time purchase of one of our on-premise appliances, connecting the appliance to the internet, and activating services, for which they primarily pay on a monthly basis. We believe we have achieved high levels of customer retention and loyalty by delivering exceptional quality and customer satisfaction.\nWe generate subscription and services revenue by selling subscriptions and other services for our communications services, as well as other connected services. We generate our product and other revenue from the sale of our on-premise appliances and our end-point devices, as well as from porting fees to enable customers to transfer their existing phone numbers to the Ooma service. We primarily offer our solutions in the U.S. and Canadian markets.\nOn February 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method, which resulted in timing and presentation changes affecting our consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations. Product revenue for sales made through our channel partners is recognized when we deliver product to our partners (sell-in basis) rather than deferring recognition until resale by the partners to the end customers (sell-through basis). We also capitalize a significant portion of our sales commission costs as an incremental cost of obtaining a customer contract and amortize them to sales and marketing expense over an expected period of benefit of five years. In prior years, all sales commissions were expensed as incurred. Our financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the provisions under Topic 606. Comparative prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the historic accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. (See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.)\nIn March 2018, we acquired Voxter, a provider of customizable UCaaS offerings for mid-market and enterprise businesses for upfront cash consideration of $2.4 million, net of cash acquired of $0.1 million. (See Note 12: Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). We believe Voxter's UCaaS offerings, which we refer to as Ooma Enterprise, will complement our Ooma Office solution and allow us to meet the needs of larger organizations. Although Ooma Enterprise was not material to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2019, we expect it to be a strategic growth initiative for our business long-term.\nBeginning with fiscal 2019, we refer to Ooma Office and Ooma Enterprise collectively as Ooma Business. Ooma Residential includes Ooma Telo basic and premier services as well as our Smart Security solutions. Beginning in fiscal 2018, we modified our key business metrics to focus on data related to our core business which is Ooma Residential and Ooma Business. Accordingly, our key business metrics below for core users, annualized exit recurring revenue and net dollar subscription retention rate reflect this change and exclude Business Promoter users and revenue for all periods presented.\nSee Item 1. Business above for additional information regarding our business, products and services, competitive market and regulatory matters.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 39\nFiscal 2019 Highlights\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Total revenue was $129.2 million, up 13% year-over-year, reflecting a 5% increase in core users, primarily driven by Ooma Business.

Our core user growth is a key indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our anticipated future subscription and services revenue, especially Ooma Business.\nLow core user churn. We believe that maintaining our current low core user churn is an important factor in our ability to continue to improve our financial performance and is a distinguishing advantage over many of our competitors. We focus on providing high-quality services and support to our users so they are motivated to remain with us. Our core user churn rate is higher for Ooma Business customers than Ooma Residential customers, which is driven in part by the failure rate of small businesses. Accordingly, we expect that our overall core user churn rate will increase if sales of our business products increase relative to sales of residential products.\nGrowth in additional services. We believe that there is significant opportunity for us to increase the additional subscription and services that our customers purchase from us in both the business and residential markets. Customers who purchase additional subscription and services from us generate more value to Ooma over the life of our customer relationship. In order to drive adoption of additional services, we will need to continue to enhance our existing solutions and develop new connected services. For example, we are investing to develop our comprehensive smart security solution and continue to invest in Ooma Business to launch additional features.\nInvesting in long-term revenue growth. We believe that our total addressable market opportunity is large and we intend to continue investing in sales and marketing to grow our user base. However, we expect the markets in which we conduct our business will remain highly competitive. We recently entered the home security market and face significant competition from incumbent providers promoting their own offerings. We also expect to continue investing in research and development to enhance our platform and develop additional connected services. We may evaluate additional possible acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to our business.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the key metrics below to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Key business metrics exclude Business Promoter data for all periods presented because it is not part of our core cloud communications business. We believe that this change enables us to better evaluate the performance of our core cloud communications business in a given period compared to those in prior and future periods.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 40\nThe following table sets forth our key metrics for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core users\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annualized exit recurring revenue (AERR)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 102,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net dollar subscription retention rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,859\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (217\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,414\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCore Users increased 5% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by growth in business users. We believe that the number of our core users is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our anticipated future subscription and services revenue. We define our core users as the number of active residential user accounts and office user extensions. We believe that the relationship that we establish with our core users positions us to sell additional premium communications services and other new connected services to them.\nAnnualized Exit Recurring Revenue increased year-over-year due to an increase in the average revenue per core user, which was largely driven by the increase in our total core user base. We believe that AERR is an indicator of recurring subscription and services revenue for near-term future periods. We estimate our AERR by dividing our recurring quarterly subscription revenue (excluding Talkatone revenue) by the average number of core users each quarter, and annualize by multiplying by four. We then multiply that result by the number of core users at the end of the period to calculate AERR.\nNet Dollar Subscription Retention Rate was 99% for fiscal 2019, driven by growth in average revenue per user and net retention rate. This rate declined by 2% year-over-year due to minor changes in retention rate and lower growth in average revenue per user, primarily for residential customers. We believe that our net dollar subscription retention rate provides insight into our ability to retain and grow our subscription and services revenue, and is an indicator of the long-term value of our customer relationships and the stability of our revenue base. It measures the percentage year-over-year change in our recurring subscription revenue per core user (excluding Talkatone revenue), which is then adjusted by factoring in the percentage of our core users we have retained during the same period. Our net dollar subscription retention rate is affected by changes in average amounts that our core users pay to us, fluctuations in the number of our core users, and our core user churn rate.\nWe calculate our estimated net dollar subscription retention rate for our core users by multiplying:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> our year-over-year percentage change in annual recurring revenue per core user, which is calculated by:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> determining the annual recurring revenue per core user by dividing annual recurring revenue for the period ended by the number of core users at the end of that particular period; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> calculating the year-over-year percentage change in annual recurring revenue per core user by dividing the current period recurring revenue per core user by the annual recurring revenue per core user for the same period in the prior year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nby:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> our core user annual retention rate, which is calculated by:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> determining our core user churn, by identifying the number of paying core users who terminate service during a month, excluding infant churn, which we define as office extensions and home users who terminate service prior to the end of the second full calendar month after their activation date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> calculating our monthly churn rate by dividing our churn in a month by the number of core users at the beginning of that month; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> calculating our annual retention rate as one minus the sum of our monthly churn rates for the preceding 12-month period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to manage our business, evaluate our performance and make planning decisions. We consider this measure to be a useful measure of our operating performance, because it contains adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers being the core operating performance, and are used by our management for that purpose. We also believe this measure enables us to better evaluate our performance by facilitating a meaningful comparison of our core operating results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance with competitors. Adjusted EBITDA represents net loss before interest and other income, non-cash income tax benefit, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and related taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and certain litigation costs that are not representative of the ordinary course of our business.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 41\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not consider any expenses for assets being depreciated and amortized that are necessary to our business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation and related taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, certain litigation costs, non-cash income tax benefits, and change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect other non-operating expenses, net of other non-operating income, including net interest and other income/expense; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,572\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,121\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,949\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reconciling items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (830\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (603\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (327\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (384\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (342\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Litigation costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation and related taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,859\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (217\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,414\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nSubscription and services revenue consists primarily of recurring subscription fees from customers accessing our communications solutions, such as Ooma Residential, Ooma Business and other subscriptions, and to a lesser extent from payments associated with advertisements through the Talkatone mobile application. We expect our subscription and services revenue to continue to grow as we continue to expand our core user base, driven primarily by growth in Ooma Business.\nProduct and other revenue consists primarily of sales of our on-premise appliances and end-point devices used in connection with our services, including shipping and handling fees for our direct customers, and to a lesser extent from porting fees we charge our customers to enable them to transfer their existing phone numbers to Ooma Business or Residential. We expect our product and other revenue to remain relatively flat or grow modestly on a year-over-year basis.\nCost of revenue and gross margin\nCost of subscription and services revenue includes payments made for third-party network operations and telecommunications services, Federal Universal Service Fund contributions, credit card processing fees, costs to maintain third-party data centers, including co-location fees for the right to place our servers in third-party data centers, depreciation and maintenance of servers and equipment, personnel costs associated with customer care and network operations support, and allocated costs of facilities and information technology.\nCost of product and other revenue includes the costs associated with the manufacturing of our on-premise appliances and end-point devices, as well as personnel costs for employees and contractors, costs related to porting our customers' phone numbers to our service, shipping and handling costs, and allocated costs of facilities and information technology.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 42\nSubscription and services gross margin may fluctuate from period-to-period based on the interplay of a number of factors, including the costs we pay to third-party telecommunications providers, the timing of capital expenditures and related depreciation charges, and changes in our headcount. We expect our subscription and services gross margin to increase over the long-term, in part as our business revenue becomes a larger portion of total subscription revenue.\nProduct and other gross margin may fluctuate from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including total units shipped during a period as compared to the direct costs of production and relatively fixed personnel costs incurred during the period. We sell our on-premise appliances at an aggressive price point to facilitate the adoption of our platform and services. We expect our product and other gross margin to continue to be negative for the foreseeable future.\nOur subscription and services gross margin is significantly higher than product and other gross margin. As a result, any significant change in the mix between subscription and services revenue and product and other revenue will cause our total gross margin to change. For example, in periods where we sell significantly more on-premise appliances, we would expect our total gross margin to be impacted.\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing expenses are the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of personnel costs for employees and contractors directly associated with sales and marketing activities, internet, television, radio advertising fees, public relations expenses, commissions we pay to internal sales personnel, third-party sales entities and resellers, trade show expenses, travel expenses, marketing and promotional activities and allocated costs of facilities and information technology. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue as well as in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business.\nResearch and development expenses are focused on developing new and expanded features for our services and improvements to our platform and backend architecture. Research and development is expensed as incurred and consists primarily of personnel costs for employees and contractors, allocated costs of facilities and information technology, software tools and product certification. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees and contractors. In addition, it includes professional service fees, legal fees, acquisition-related transaction costs and earn-outs, and allocated costs of facilities and information technology. We expect our general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenue.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 43\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table

fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSubscription and services revenue increased $14.4 million or 14% year-over-year, primarily driven by a 5% increase in our core users and in part by changes to our residential pricing structure that were implemented in October 2017. Year-over-year revenue growth reflected a combined 19% increase in subscription and services revenue from Ooma Business and Ooma Residential that was offset in part by a decline in revenue from Talkatone and the non-existence of revenue from Business Promoter (due to the sale of the Business Promoter service in August 2017). Revenue earned from Business Promoter was approximately $1.8 million for fiscal 2018.\nProduct and other revenue increased $0.3 million or 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase for sales of our smart security products offset in part by a decline in sales of on-premise appliances and other accessories.\nAdoption of the new Topic 606 revenue recognition rules resulted in a $0.2 million increase to revenue for fiscal 2019 as compared to what would have been recognized under the legacy Topic 605 rules. See Note 3: Recent Accounting Standards in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nWe derived approximately 71% and 72% of our total revenue from Ooma Residential and approximately 22% and 16% from Ooma Business in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSubscription and services revenue increased $10.9 million, or 12%, year-over-year, driven by a 59% increase in revenue from Ooma Business and a 12% increase from Ooma Residential, offset in part by a decline in revenue from Talkatone and Business Promoter. Year-over-year revenue growth reflected an 8% increase in our core users to approximately 929,000 as of January 31, 2018 from approximately 858,000 as of January 31, 2017, as well as changes to our residential customer pricing structure that were implemented in October 2017. Revenue earned from Business Promoter declined to approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 2018 from approximately $5.4 million in the prior year, due to our sale of the Business Promoter service in August 2017.\nProduct and other revenue decreased $0.9 million or 7% year-over-year, primarily attributable to lower Ooma Residential-related sales, offset in part by growth in unit sales of smart security sensors and end-point devices.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 45\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\n</td>

Fiscal 2018\nSubscription and services gross margin of 69% was flat year-over-year. Cost of subscription and services revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $4.7 million or 15% year-over-year, reflecting a $2.8 million increase in regulatory costs, primarily associated with changes made to our residential pricing structure in October 2017, and a $0.8 million increase in personnel-related costs and a $0.3 million increase in network infrastructure related costs.\nProduct and other revenue gross margin of negative 30% decreased year-over-year from negative 20% due to a $0.4 million increase in freight charges, including recently imposed tariffs, as well as a $0.3 million increase in material product costs and a $0.2 million increase in other period costs.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nSubscription and services gross margin increased to 69% in fiscal 2018 as compared to 67% in fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher proportionate growth of subscription and services revenue. The improvement in gross margin was driven by higher revenues from Ooma Business and the benefits of scale on a larger core user base. Cost of subscription and services revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $1.8 million year-over-year, reflecting a $0.9 million increase in credit card processing fees, a $0.7 million increase in network infrastructure related costs, driven by our international expansion, and to a lesser extent increases in personnel and consultant costs that were partly offset by a decline in the Business Promoter cost of sales due to our sale of the Business Promoter service in August 2017.\nProduct and other revenue gross margin of negative 20% decreased year-over-year from negative 16% due to a decrease in the sale of end-point devices and related porting fees. The decrease in cost of product and other revenue of $0.6 million reflected higher freight costs due to increased direct consumer shipments in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and Marketing\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018. Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2019 increased $3.5 million or 9% year-over-year, primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount and our business acquisitions, coupled with a $1.6 million increase in marketing activities, and a $0.3 million increase in facilities related costs, driven by our continued business expansion. These increases were offset in part by a $2.5 million year-over-year decrease in sales commissions expenses, as we started capitalizing these costs in fiscal 2019 under the new Topic 606 accounting rules. The year-over-year increase in sales and marketing reflects our strategy to drive continued growth in Ooma Business and create further market awareness of our products.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 46\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017. Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $3.5 million or 10% year-over-year, due to a $3.7 million increase in sales commissions, a net $1.1 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount, coupled with a $0.6 million increase in facilities related costs and a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation. These higher expenses were offset in part by a net $2.6 million decrease in marketing activities, primarily Ooma Residential-related advertising expenses. The year-over-year growth in sales and marketing supported the expansion of our sales efforts to drive growth in our small business solutions.\nResearch and Development\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2019 increased $4.6 million or 16% year-over-year, primarily due to a $3.9 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount and our recent acquisitions, as well as a $0.3 million increase in non-recurring engineering and license costs. The year-over-year growth in research and development reflects continued enhancements to Ooma Business as well as adding new features and product offerings to our Smart Security solution, including the Butterfleye smart camera.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $5.1 million or 21% year-over-year, primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount, a $1.0 million increase in facilities, supplies and equipment related costs and a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation. The year-over-year growth in research and development supported the continued development of our office platform, including international expansion, as well as adding new features and product offerings to our home security solution.\nGeneral and Administrative\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 increased $2.4 million or 16% year-over-year, mainly reflecting a $1.8 million increase in personnel related costs that were driven by higher headcount, as well as a $0.3 million increase in acquisition-related transaction expenses.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $0.6 million or 4% year-over-year, reflecting a $1.0 million increase in personnel related costs and stock-based compensation costs, driven by higher headcount, offset in part by a $0.5 million decrease in legal expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $0.4 million for fiscal 2019, primarily associated with our acquisition of Voxter. We did not record a provision or benefit for income taxes in fiscal years 2018 and 2017. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. See Note 9: Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, this Form 10-K contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net loss and Adjusted EBITDA (see above). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related taxes, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization of acquired intangibles, non-cash acquisition-related income tax benefit, and certain litigation costs that are not representative of the ordinary course of our business.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results and core business operations. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful measures of the operating performance of the Company, because they contain adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers to be our core operating performance, and are used by our management for that purpose. We also believe that these non-GAAP financial measures allow for a better evaluation of our performance by facilitating a meaningful comparison of our core operating results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance of a company.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only to aid an understanding of our operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that the adjustments relate to items that the Company generally expects to continue to recognize. The adjustment of these items should not be construed as an inference that the adjusted gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, both GAAP financial measures of Ooma's financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 47\nReconciliations of our GAAP

Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method, which resulted in timing and presentation changes affecting our consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations. Our financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the provisions under Topic 606. Comparative prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the historic accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. (See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.)\nRevenue. Our total revenue has grown sequentially each quarter due to the continued growth in our subscriber base driven by an increase in our core users.\nGross Margin. Over the past eight fiscal quarters, our gross margin has fluctuated between 57% and 62% due to changes in our product mix and the introduction of new products.\nOperating Expenses. Our quarterly operating expenses in absolute dollars have increased significantly from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019, primarily driven by growing headcount and personnel-related expenses, as well as marketing and advertising expenses associated with our efforts to increase our overall subscriber base and product sales.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 48\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had $42.6 million of total cash, cash equivalents and investments. Our primary source of cash is receipts from sales to our customers. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditure, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions.\nWe may in the future make investments in or acquisitions of businesses or technologies, which may require the use of cash. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisition of Voxter for upfront cash consideration of approximately $2.4 million, net of cash acquired of $0.1 million, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we invested $1.3 million in cash to a small privately-held technology company, in exchange for an 18-month convertible promissory note (see Note 6: Balance Sheet Components of the notes to our consolidated financial statements).\nThe table below provides selected cash flow information, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,926\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,155\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,969\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (525\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (839\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,423\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe table below provides selected cash flow information, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,572\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,121\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,949\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in operating assets and liabilities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Increase) decrease in accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,050\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Increase) decrease in inventories and deferred inventory costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,213\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (426\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Increase) decrease in other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,334\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,519\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in accounts payable and accrued expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (156\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in deferred revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,926\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor fiscal 2019, our net loss of $14.6 million included non-cash charges of $12.3 million primarily related to stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization.

Our capital expenditures have primarily been for general business purposes, including expansion of our network operations centers, computer equipment used internally, website development and leasehold improvements as we have expanded our office space to accommodate our growth in headcount.\nDuring fiscal 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $14.9 million, which consisted of proceeds of $59.0 million from maturities and sales of short-term investments, offset in part by $38.5 million used for purchases of short-term investments, $1.9 million used for capital expenditures, $2.4 million used for the acquisition of Voxter in the first quarter, and $1.3 million used to invest in a privately-held technology company in the fourth quarter (see Note 6: Balance Sheet Components of the notes to our consolidated financial statements).\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash used in investing activities was $2.2 million, which consisted of purchases of short-term investments of $49.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of $2.5 million, and a business acquisition for $1.4 million, offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments totaling $51.0 million. The decrease in cash outflow from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was attributable primarily to activity in our investment portfolio, reflecting a decrease in investment purchases and an increase in maturities.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated from financing activities include net proceeds from common stock issuances related to employee stock benefit plans and proceeds from borrowings, if any, under our credit facilities, if any. Cash used in financing activities includes payment of shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), repayment of debt and capital leases and payment of acquisition-related earn-outs.\nDuring fiscal 2019, financing activities consisted of payments of $2.9 million related to shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs, offset by proceeds of $2.9 million from common stock issuances under our employee stock plans.\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash used in financing activities was $0.5 million, which consisted of payments of $2.4 million related to shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs, offset by proceeds of $1.9 million from common stock issuances under our employee stock plans.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of January 31, 2019, our total future expected payment obligations under non-cancelable operating leases with terms longer than one year were approximately $4.6 million. See Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a table of contractual obligations, including payments due by period. As of January 31, 2019, non-cancelable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers totaled approximately $4.2 million.\nWe do not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities such as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 50\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flows and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our future consolidated financial statements will be affected to the extent that our actual results materially differ from these estimates. Note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from two sources: (1) subscription and services revenue, which is generated from the sale of subscription plans and other services; and (2) product and other revenue. Our financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the provisions under Topic 606. Comparative prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, the historic accounting standard in effect for the prior periods presented.\nSubscription revenue is derived primarily from recurring subscription fees related to service plans such as Ooma Business, Ooma Residential and other communications services. All subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual service term. Product and other revenue is generated from the sale of on-premise appliances and end-point devices, including shipping and handling fees for our direct customers, and to a lesser extent from porting fees that enable customers to transfer their existing phone numbers. Beginning fiscal 2019, we recognize revenue from sales to direct end-customers and channel partners at the point in time that control transfers which is typically when we deliver the product or when all customer contractual provisions have been met, if any. Our distribution agreements with channel partners typically contain clauses for price protection and right of return. Prior to fiscal 2019, we deferred product revenue and related costs of revenue on these product channel sales until title was transferred to the end-customer. See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our subscription and services revenue and product and other revenue.\nOur contracts with customers typically contain multiple performance obligations that consist of product(s) and related communications services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The contract transaction price is then allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price ( SSP\u201d) basis. We determine the SSP for our communications services based on observable historical stand-alone sales to customers, for which we require that a substantial majority of selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We do not have a directly observable SSP for our on-premise appliance and end-point devices, and therefore we establish SSP based on our best estimates and judgments, considering company-specific factors such as pricing strategies, estimated product and other costs, and bundling and discounting practices. The determination of SSP is made through consultation with and approval by our management. As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and the timing of our revenue recognition could be affected.\nSales Reserves. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns from end users and customer sales incentives at the time the related revenue is recognized. Product returns and customer sales incentives are estimated based on our historical experience, current trends and expectations regarding future experience. Trends are influenced by product life cycles, new product introductions, market acceptance of products, the type of customer, seasonality and other factors. Product return and sales incentive rates may fluctuate over time but are sufficiently predictable to allow our management to estimate expected future amounts. If actual future returns and sales incentives differ from past experience, additional reserves may be required. To date, actual results have not been materially different from our estimates.\nInventories\nAt each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected future demand, actual historical experience and certain other factors. We adjust our inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value. In determining the adequacy of inventory write-downs, we analyze the following, among other things:\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> current inventory quantity on hand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> product acceptance and competitiveness in the marketplace;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> customer demand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> historical sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 51\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> forecast sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> product life cycles and obsolescence, and;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> technological innovations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded in cost of goods sold within the consolidated statement of operations during the period in which such write-downs are determined as necessary by management. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Inventory write-downs recorded for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not material.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the equity award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of each RSU granted is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each stock purchase right under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d) is calculated based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant and the value of put and call options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables, of which the most subjective were estimated as follows:\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Term. We do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time stock-based awards have been exercisable since the completion of our IPO in July 2015. As a result, we used the simplified method to calculate the expected term estimate based on the vesting and contractual terms of the option. Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the average of the stock-based award's weighted average vesting period and its contractual term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Stock Price Volatility. As we do not have a significant trading history for our common stock, we determined the expected volatility using a combination of the average historical volatility of a group of comparable publicly traded companies and our own common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to Note 8: Stock-Based Compensation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our estimates related to stock-based compensation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe use a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Deferred tax assets associated with our unrecognized tax benefits were fully offset by a valuation allowance as of January 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 52", "item_7_truncated": "Income Taxes\n \u2022 an increase of $2.4 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily due to the timing of payments and reflecting higher operating expenses compared to the prior year \nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core users\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annualized exit recurring revenue (AERR)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 102,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net dollar subscription retention rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,859\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (217\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,414\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generate subscription and services revenue by selling subscriptions and other services for our communications services, as well as other connected services.

All subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual service term. Product and other revenue is generated from the sale of on-premise appliances and end-point devices, including shipping and handling fees for our direct customers, and to a lesser extent from porting fees that enable customers to transfer their existing phone numbers. Beginning fiscal 2019, we recognize revenue from sales to direct end-customers and channel partners at the point in time that control transfers which is typically when we deliver the product or when all customer contractual provisions have been met, if any. Our distribution agreements with channel partners typically contain clauses for price protection and right of return. Prior to fiscal 2019, we deferred product revenue and related costs of revenue on these product channel sales until title was transferred to the end-customer. See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our subscription and services revenue and product and other revenue.\nCost of product and other revenue includes the costs associated with the manufacturing of our on-premise appliances and end-point devices, as well as personnel costs for employees and contractors, costs related to porting our customers' phone numbers to our service, shipping and handling costs, and allocated costs of facilities and information technology.\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,926\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,155\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,969\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (525\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (839\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,423\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription and services gross margin of 69% was flat year-over-year.

We believe that AERR is an indicator of recurring subscription and services revenue for near-term future periods. We estimate our AERR by dividing our recurring quarterly subscription revenue (excluding Talkatone revenue) by the average number of core users each quarter, and annualize by multiplying by four. We then multiply that result by the number of core users at the end of the period to calculate AERR.\nInventories\nReconciliations of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures were as follows (in thousands):\nSubscription and services gross margin increased to 69% in fiscal 2018 as compared to 67% in fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher proportionate growth of subscription and services revenue. The improvement in gross margin was driven by higher revenues from Ooma Business and the benefits of scale on a larger core user base. Cost of subscription and services revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $1.8 million year-over-year, reflecting a $0.9 million increase in credit card processing fees, a $0.7 million increase in network infrastructure related costs, driven by our international expansion, and to a lesser extent increases in personnel and consultant costs that were partly offset by a decline in the Business Promoter cost of sales due to our sale of the Business Promoter service in August 2017.\n \u2022 Net loss was $14.6 million, compared to $13.1 million in fiscal 2018 and $12.9 million in fiscal 2017, reflecting continued investments in research and development, brand marketing and sales channels. \nOperating Activities\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, this Form 10-K contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net loss and Adjusted EBITDA (see above). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related taxes, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization of acquired intangibles, non-cash acquisition-related income tax benefit, and certain litigation costs that are not representative of the ordinary course of our business.\n \u2022 a net increase of $4.2 million in our inventory and related deferred costs to scale our business \nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 41\nSubscription and services gross margin may fluctuate from period-to-period based on the interplay of a number of factors, including the costs we pay to third-party telecommunications providers, the timing of capital expenditures and related depreciation charges, and changes in our headcount. We expect our subscription and services gross margin to increase over the long-term, in part as our business revenue becomes a larger portion of total subscription revenue.\nThe table below provides selected cash flow information, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nWe review the key metrics below to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Key business metrics exclude Business Promoter data for all periods presented because it is not part of our core cloud communications business. We believe that this change enables us to better evaluate the performance of our core cloud communications business in a given period compared to those in prior and future periods.\nNet Dollar Subscription Retention Rate was 99% for fiscal 2019, driven by growth in average revenue per user and net retention rate. This rate declined by 2% year-over-year due to minor changes in retention rate and lower growth in average revenue per user, primarily for residential customers. We believe that our net dollar subscription retention rate provides insight into our ability to retain and grow our subscription and services revenue, and is an indicator of the long-term value of our customer relationships and the stability of our revenue base. It measures the percentage year-over-year change in our recurring subscription revenue per core user (excluding Talkatone revenue), which is then adjusted by factoring in the percentage of our core users we have retained during the same period. Our net dollar subscription retention rate is affected by changes in average amounts that our core users pay to us, fluctuations in the number of our core users, and our core user churn rate.\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nRevenue Recognition\n (ii) our core user annual retention rate, which is calculated by: \n (i) our year-over-year percentage change in annual recurring revenue per core user, which is calculated by: \n \u2022 Total gross margin was 59%, flat from 59% in fiscal 2018 and up from 57% in fiscal 2017, driven by the higher growth of our subscription and services revenue as compared to product and other revenue. \nResearch and Development\n \u25aa calculating our monthly churn rate by dividing our churn in a month by the number of core users at the beginning of that month; and \nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017. Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $3.5 million or 10% year-over-year, due to a $3.7 million increase in sales commissions, a net $1.1 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount, coupled with a $0.6 million increase in facilities related costs and a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation. These higher expenses were offset in part by a net $2.6 million decrease in marketing activities, primarily Ooma Residential-related advertising expenses. The year-over-year growth in sales and marketing supported the expansion of our sales efforts to drive growth in our small business solutions.\n \u25aa determining our core user churn, by identifying the number of paying core users who terminate service during a month, excluding infant churn, which we define as office extensions and home users who terminate service prior to the end of the second full calendar month after their activation date; \nProduct and other revenue decreased $0.9 million or 7% year-over-year, primarily attributable to lower Ooma Residential-related sales, offset in part by growth in unit sales of smart security sensors and end-point devices.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $5.1 million or 21% year-over-year, primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount, a $1.0 million increase in facilities, supplies and equipment related costs and a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation. The year-over-year growth in research and development supported the continued development of our office platform, including international expansion, as well as adding new features and product offerings to our home security solution.\n \u25aa calculating our annual retention rate as one minus the sum of our monthly churn rates for the preceding 12-month period. \nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to manage our business, evaluate our performance and make planning decisions. We consider this measure to be a useful measure of our operating performance, because it contains adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers being the core operating performance, and are used by our management for that purpose. We also believe this measure enables us to better evaluate our performance by facilitating a meaningful comparison of our core operating results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance with competitors. Adjusted EBITDA represents net loss before interest and other income, non-cash income tax benefit, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and related taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and certain litigation costs that are not representative of the ordinary course of our business.\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had $42.6 million of total cash, cash equivalents and investments. Our primary source of cash is receipts from sales to our customers. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditure, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results and core business operations. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful measures of the operating performance of the Company, because they contain adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers to be our core operating performance, and are used by our management for that purpose. We also believe that these non-GAAP financial measures allow for a better evaluation of our performance by facilitating a meaningful comparison of our core operating results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance of a company.\nResearch and development expenses are focused on developing new and expanded features for our services and improvements to our platform and backend architecture. Research and development is expensed as incurred and consists primarily of personnel costs for employees and contractors, allocated costs of facilities and information technology, software tools and product certification. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars.\n\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018\nRefer to Note 8: Stock-Based Compensation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our estimates related to stock-based compensation.\nInvesting in long-term revenue growth. We believe that our total addressable market opportunity is large and we intend to continue investing in sales and marketing to grow our user base. However, we expect the markets in which we conduct our business will remain highly competitive. We recently entered the home security market and face significant competition from incumbent providers promoting their own offerings. We also expect to continue investing in research and development to enhance our platform and develop additional connected services. We may evaluate additional possible acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to our business.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nProduct and other revenue gross margin of negative 20% decreased year-over-year from negative 16% due to a decrease in the sale of end-point devices and related porting fees. The decrease in cost of product and other revenue of $0.6 million reflected higher freight costs due to increased direct consumer shipments in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.\nSubscription and services revenue increased $14.4 million or 14% year-over-year, primarily driven by a 5% increase in our core users and in part by changes to our residential pricing structure that were implemented in October 2017. Year-over-year revenue growth reflected a combined 19% increase in subscription and services revenue from Ooma Business and Ooma Residential that was offset in part by a decline in revenue from Talkatone and the non-existence of revenue from Business Promoter (due to the sale of the Business Promoter service in August 2017). Revenue earned from Business Promoter was approximately $1.8 million for fiscal 2018.\nOverall, the decrease in operating cash flow from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in cash-based operating expenses (see Results of Operations\u201d above) coupled with increased inventory procurement to scale our business.\n\nCore Users increased 5% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by growth in business users. We believe that the number of our core users is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our anticipated future subscription and services revenue. We define our core users as the number of active residential user accounts and office user extensions. We believe that the relationship that we establish with our core users positions us to sell additional premium communications services and other new connected services to them.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nCash generated from financing activities include net proceeds from common stock issuances related to employee stock benefit plans and proceeds from borrowings, if any, under our credit facilities, if any. Cash used in financing activities includes payment of shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), repayment of debt and capital leases and payment of acquisition-related earn-outs.\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash used in investing activities was $2.2 million, which consisted of purchases of short-term investments of $49.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of $2.5 million, and a business acquisition for $1.4 million, offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments totaling $51.0 million. The decrease in cash outflow from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was attributable primarily to activity in our investment portfolio, reflecting a decrease in investment purchases and an increase in maturities.\nRevenue\nCosts and expenses included stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nExecutive Overview\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 40\nAt each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected future demand, actual historical experience and certain other factors. We adjust our inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value. In determining the adequacy of inventory write-downs, we analyze the following, among other things:\nProduct and other gross margin may fluctuate from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including total units shipped during a period as compared to the direct costs of production and relatively fixed personnel costs incurred during the period. We sell our on-premise appliances at an aggressive price point to facilitate the adoption of our platform and services. We expect our product and other gross margin to continue to be negative for the foreseeable future.\nQuarterly Results of Operations and Trends\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 46\n\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2019 increased $4.6 million or 16% year-over-year, primarily due to a $3.9 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount and our recent acquisitions, as well as a $0.3 million increase in non-recurring engineering and license costs. The year-over-year growth in research and development reflects continued enhancements to Ooma Business as well as adding new features and product offerings to our Smart Security solution, including the Butterfleye smart camera.\nInvesting Activities\nby:\n \u2022 Expected Term. We do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time stock-based awards have been exercisable since the completion of our IPO in July 2015. As a result, we used the simplified method to calculate the expected term estimate based on the vesting and contractual terms of the option. Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the average of the stock-based award's weighted average vesting period and its contractual term. \nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $0.4 million for fiscal 2019, primarily associated with our acquisition of Voxter. We did not record a provision or benefit for income taxes in fiscal years 2018 and 2017. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. See Note 9: Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nFor fiscal 2018, our net loss of $13.1 million included non-cash charges of $13.3 million primarily related to stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization. Operating asset and liability changes for fiscal 2018 included:\n \u2022 Cash used in operations was $3.9 million, compared to cash provided from operations of $3.2 million in fiscal 2018 and $0.4 million in fiscal 2017. Cash usage reflects our investments in operating expenses to execute on our growth initiatives. \nBeginning with fiscal 2019, we refer to Ooma Office and Ooma Enterprise collectively as Ooma Business. Ooma Residential includes Ooma Telo basic and premier services as well as our Smart Security solutions. Beginning in fiscal 2018, we modified our key business metrics to focus on data related to our core business which is Ooma Residential and Ooma Business. Accordingly, our key business metrics below for core users, annualized exit recurring revenue and net dollar subscription retention rate reflect this change and exclude Business Promoter users and revenue for all periods presented.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe may in the future make investments in or acquisitions of businesses or technologies, which may require the use of cash. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisition of Voxter for upfront cash consideration of approximately $2.4 million, net of cash acquired of $0.1 million, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we invested $1.3 million in cash to a small privately-held technology company, in exchange for an 18-month convertible promissory note (see Note 6: Balance Sheet Components of the notes to our consolidated financial statements).\nGrowth in additional services. We believe that there is significant opportunity for us to increase the additional subscription and services that our customers purchase from us in both the business and residential markets. Customers who purchase additional subscription and services from us generate more value to Ooma over the life of our customer relationship. In order to drive adoption of additional services, we will need to continue to enhance our existing solutions and develop new connected services. For example, we are investing to develop our comprehensive smart security solution and continue to invest in Ooma Business to launch additional features.\nRevenue. Our total revenue has grown sequentially each quarter due to the continued growth in our subscriber base driven by an increase in our core users.\n \u2022 customer demand; \nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flows and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our future consolidated financial statements will be affected to the extent that our actual results materially differ from these estimates. Note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\n \u2022 a net increase of $1.5 million in prepaid expenses and other assets due to the timing of certain payments \nSee Item 1. Business above for additional information regarding our business, products and services, competitive market and regulatory matters.\nWe drive the adoption of our platform by providing communications solutions to the large and growing markets for business, residential and mobile users, and then accelerate growth by offering new and innovative connected services to our user base. Our customers adopt our platform by making a one-time purchase of one of our on-premise appliances, connecting the appliance to the internet, and activating services, for which they primarily pay on a monthly basis. We believe we have achieved high levels of customer retention and loyalty by delivering exceptional quality and customer satisfaction.\nThe increase in operating cash flow from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increased cash collections from our customers, driven by revenue growth year-over-year, as well as favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nGross Margin. Over the past eight fiscal quarters, our gross margin has fluctuated between 57% and 62% due to changes in our product mix and the introduction of new products.\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.9) million, compared to ($0.2) million in fiscal 2018 and ($1.4) million in fiscal 2017. \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees and contractors. In addition, it includes professional service fees, legal fees, acquisition-related transaction costs and earn-outs, and allocated costs of facilities and information technology. We expect our general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenue.\n\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 50\nWe do not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities such as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\nProduct and other revenue increased $0.3 million or 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase for sales of our smart security products offset in part by a decline in sales of on-premise appliances and other accessories.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation and related taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, certain litigation costs, non-cash income tax benefits, and change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration; \nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 42\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 49\nStock-Based Compensation\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 47\n\nSales Reserves. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns from end users and customer sales incentives at the time the related revenue is recognized. Product returns and customer sales incentives are estimated based on our historical experience, current trends and expectations regarding future experience. Trends are influenced by product life cycles, new product introductions, market acceptance of products, the type of customer, seasonality and other factors. Product return and sales incentive rates may fluctuate over time but are sufficiently predictable to allow our management to estimate expected future amounts. If actual future returns and sales incentives differ from past experience, additional reserves may be required. To date, actual results have not been materially different from our estimates.\nDuring fiscal 2019, financing activities consisted of payments of $2.9 million related to shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs, offset by proceeds of $2.9 million from common stock issuances under our employee stock plans.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $0.6 million or 4% year-over-year, reflecting a $1.0 million increase in personnel related costs and stock-based compensation costs, driven by higher headcount, offset in part by a $0.5 million decrease in legal expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOoma creates powerful connected experiences for businesses and consumers. Our smart cloud-based SaaS platform serves as a communications hub, which offers cloud-based communications solutions, smart security and other connected services. Our business and residential solutions deliver our proprietary PureVoice high-definition voice quality, advanced functionality and integration with mobile devices, at competitive pricing and value. Our platform helps create smart workplaces and homes by providing communications, monitoring, security, automation, productivity and networking infrastructure applications.\nWe use a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Deferred tax assets associated with our unrecognized tax benefits were fully offset by a valuation allowance as of January 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFiscal 2019 Highlights\nOn February 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method, which resulted in timing and presentation changes affecting our consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations. Product revenue for sales made through our channel partners is recognized when we deliver product to our partners (sell-in basis) rather than deferring recognition until resale by the partners to the end customers (sell-through basis). We also capitalize a significant portion of our sales commission costs as an incremental cost of obtaining a customer contract and amortize them to sales and marketing expense over an expected period of benefit of five years. In prior years, all sales commissions were expensed as incurred. Our financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the provisions under Topic 606. Comparative prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the historic accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. (See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.)\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect other non-operating expenses, net of other non-operating income, including net interest and other income/expense; and \n \u2022 Subscription and services revenue has increased as a percentage of our total revenue over the last three years, from approximately 87% in fiscal 2017 to 90% in fiscal 2019. We expect subscription and services revenue to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. \nIncome Taxes\nThe table below provides selected cash flow information, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nAs of January 31, 2019, our total future expected payment obligations under non-cancelable operating leases with terms longer than one year were approximately $4.6 million. See Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a table of contractual obligations, including payments due by period. As of January 31, 2019, non-cancelable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers totaled approximately $4.2 million.\nThe determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables, of which the most subjective were estimated as follows:\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn March 2018, we acquired Voxter, a provider of customizable UCaaS offerings for mid-market and enterprise businesses for upfront cash consideration of $2.4 million, net of cash acquired of $0.1 million. (See Note 12: Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). We believe Voxter's UCaaS offerings, which we refer to as Ooma Enterprise, will complement our Ooma Office solution and allow us to meet the needs of larger organizations. Although Ooma Enterprise was not material to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2019, we expect it to be a strategic growth initiative for our business long-term.\n \u2022 product life cycles and obsolescence, and; \nFinancing Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018. Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2019 increased $3.5 million or 9% year-over-year, primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount and our business acquisitions, coupled with a $1.6 million increase in marketing activities, and a $0.3 million increase in facilities related costs, driven by our continued business expansion. These increases were offset in part by a $2.5 million year-over-year decrease in sales commissions expenses, as we started capitalizing these costs in fiscal 2019 under the new Topic 606 accounting rules. The year-over-year increase in sales and marketing reflects our strategy to drive continued growth in Ooma Business and create further market awareness of our products.\nOur investing activities include short-term investment activities, capital expenditures and business acquisitions. Our capital expenditures have primarily been for general business purposes, including expansion of our network operations centers, computer equipment used internally, website development and leasehold improvements as we have expanded our office space to accommodate our growth in headcount.\n \u2022 Total revenue was $129.2 million, up 13% year-over-year, reflecting a 5% increase in core users, primarily driven by Ooma Business. We have grown our core users 14% from approximately 858,000 as of January 31, 2017 to approximately 976,000 as of January 31, 2019. \nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 51\nOur subscription and services gross margin is significantly higher than product and other gross margin. As a result, any significant change in the mix between subscription and services revenue and product and other revenue will cause our total gross margin to change. For example, in periods where we sell significantly more on-premise appliances, we would expect our total gross margin to be impacted.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 43\n \u2022 product acceptance and competitiveness in the marketplace; \nSubscription and services revenue consists primarily of recurring subscription fees from customers accessing our communications solutions, such as Ooma Residential, Ooma Business and other subscriptions, and to a lesser extent from payments associated with advertisements through the Talkatone mobile application. We expect our subscription and services revenue to continue to grow as we continue to expand our core user base, driven primarily by growth in Ooma Business.\nRevenue\nProduct and other revenue consists primarily of sales of our on-premise appliances and end-point devices used in connection with our services, including shipping and handling fees for our direct customers, and to a lesser extent from porting fees we charge our customers to enable them to transfer their existing phone numbers to Ooma Business or Residential. We expect our product and other revenue to remain relatively flat or grow modestly on a year-over-year basis.\nThe following table sets forth our key metrics for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 increased $2.4 million or 16% year-over-year, mainly reflecting a $1.8 million increase in personnel related costs that were driven by higher headcount, as well as a $0.3 million increase in acquisition-related transaction expenses.\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash used in financing activities was $0.5 million, which consisted of payments of $2.4 million related to shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs, offset by proceeds of $1.9 million from common stock issuances under our employee stock plans.\n \u25aa determining the annual recurring revenue per core user by dividing annual recurring revenue for the period ended by the number of core users at the end of that particular period; and \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider any expenses for assets being depreciated and amortized that are necessary to our business; \nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nSales and Marketing\n \u25aa calculating the year-over-year percentage change in annual recurring revenue per core user by dividing the current period recurring revenue per core user by the annual recurring revenue per core user for the same period in the prior year. \nWe calculate our estimated net dollar subscription retention rate for our core users by multiplying:\n \u2022 Subscription and services revenue from Ooma Business and Ooma Residential grew 51% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. \nCost of subscription and services revenue includes payments made for third-party network operations and telecommunications services, Federal Universal Service Fund contributions, credit card processing fees, costs to maintain third-party data centers, including co-location fees for the right to place our servers in third-party data centers, depreciation and maintenance of servers and equipment, personnel costs associated with customer care and network operations support, and allocated costs of facilities and information technology.\nWe derived approximately 71% and 72% of our total revenue from Ooma Residential and approximately 22% and 16% from Ooma Business in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n \u2022 a decrease of $1.9 million in accounts receivable primarily due to timing of billing and our cash collections, driven by lower revenue from Talkatone during fiscal 2018 as well as due to the sale of the Business Promoter service in August 2017 \n \u2022 technological innovations \nKey Business Metrics\n\n \u2022 an increase of $5.3 million in other current and non-current asses primarily due to the capitalization of sales commissions under Topic 606 \n \u2022 an increase of $8.2 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities to support the growth of our business, including higher headcount \nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 44\nCore user growth. Our core user growth is a key indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our anticipated future subscription and services revenue, especially Ooma Business.\nWe derive revenue from two sources: (1) subscription and services revenue, which is generated from the sale of subscription plans and other services; and (2) product and other revenue. Our financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the provisions under Topic 606. Comparative prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, the historic accounting standard in effect for the prior periods presented.\nLow core user churn. We believe that maintaining our current low core user churn is an important factor in our ability to continue to improve our financial performance and is a distinguishing advantage over many of our competitors. We focus on providing high-quality services and support to our users so they are motivated to remain with us. Our core user churn rate is higher for Ooma Business customers than Ooma Residential customers, which is driven in part by the failure rate of small businesses. Accordingly, we expect that our overall core user churn rate will increase if sales of our business products increase relative to sales of residential products.\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018\n\n \u2022 historical sales; \nAdoption of the new Topic 606 revenue recognition rules resulted in a $0.2 million increase to revenue for fiscal 2019 as compared to what would have been recognized under the legacy Topic 605 rules. See Note 3: Recent Accounting Standards in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is January 31, and we refer to our fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 as fiscal 2019, our fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 as fiscal 2018, and our fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 as fiscal 2017. All other references to years are references to calendar years.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only to aid an understanding of our operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that the adjustments relate to items that the Company generally expects to continue to recognize. The adjustment of these items should not be construed as an inference that the adjusted gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, both GAAP financial measures of Ooma's financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together.\n \u2022 Expected Stock Price Volatility. As we do not have a significant trading history for our common stock, we determined the expected volatility using a combination of the average historical volatility of a group of comparable publicly traded companies and our own common stock. \nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOperating expenses\nOperating Expenses. Our quarterly operating expenses in absolute dollars have increased significantly from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019, primarily driven by growing headcount and personnel-related expenses, as well as marketing and advertising expenses associated with our efforts to increase our overall subscriber base and product sales.\nProduct and other revenue gross margin of negative 30% decreased year-over-year from negative 20% due to a $0.4 million increase in freight charges, including recently imposed tariffs, as well as a $0.3 million increase in material product costs and a $0.2 million increase in other period costs.\nConsolidated Statement of Operations: Comparison of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in tables are in thousands)\n \u2022 a net decrease of $0.3 million in our inventory and related deferred costs, reflecting lower inventory levels at channel partners \nCost of revenue and gross margin\n \u2022 forecast sales; \nFor fiscal 2019, our net loss of $14.6 million included non-cash charges of $12.3 million primarily related to stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization. Operating asset and liability changes for fiscal 2019 included:\nOur contracts with customers typically contain multiple performance obligations that consist of product(s) and related communications services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The contract transaction price is then allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price ( SSP\u201d) basis. We determine the SSP for our communications services based on observable historical stand-alone sales to customers, for which we require that a substantial majority of selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We do not have a directly observable SSP for our on-premise appliance and end-point devices, and therefore we establish SSP based on our best estimates and judgments, considering company-specific factors such as pricing strategies, estimated product and other costs, and bundling and discounting practices. The determination of SSP is made through consultation with and approval by our management. As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and the timing of our revenue recognition could be affected.\nThe following table sets forth selected quarterly financial data for each of the eight quarterly periods ended January 31, 2019 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nSales and marketing expenses are the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of personnel costs for employees and contractors directly associated with sales and marketing activities, internet, television, radio advertising fees, public relations expenses, commissions we pay to internal sales personnel, third-party sales entities and resellers, trade show expenses, travel expenses, marketing and promotional activities and allocated costs of facilities and information technology. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue as well as in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business.", "item_7_text": "Income Taxes\n \u2022 an increase of $2.4 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily due to the timing of payments and reflecting higher operating expenses compared to the prior year \nWe generate subscription and services revenue by selling subscriptions and other services for our communications services, as well as other connected services. We generate our product and other revenue from the sale of our on-premise appliances and our end-point devices, as well as from porting fees to enable customers to transfer their existing phone numbers to the Ooma service. We primarily offer our solutions in the U.S. and Canadian markets.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 48\n \u2022 As of January 31, 2019, we had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $42.6 million. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 45\nDuring fiscal 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $14.9 million, which consisted of proceeds of $59.0 million from maturities and sales of short-term investments, offset in part by $38.5 million used for purchases of short-term investments, $1.9 million used for capital expenditures, $2.4 million used for the acquisition of Voxter in the first quarter, and $1.3 million used to invest in a privately-held technology company in the fourth quarter (see Note 6: Balance Sheet Components of the notes to our consolidated financial statements).\n \u2022 current inventory quantity on hand; \n\nSubscription and services revenue increased $10.9 million, or 12%, year-over-year, driven by a 59% increase in revenue from Ooma Business and a 12% increase from Ooma Residential, offset in part by a decline in revenue from Talkatone and Business Promoter. Year-over-year revenue growth reflected an 8% increase in our core users to approximately 929,000 as of January 31, 2018 from approximately 858,000 as of January 31, 2017, as well as changes to our residential customer pricing structure that were implemented in October 2017. Revenue earned from Business Promoter declined to approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 2018 from approximately $5.4 million in the prior year, due to our sale of the Business Promoter service in August 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nSubscription revenue is derived primarily from recurring subscription fees related to service plans such as Ooma Business, Ooma Residential and other communications services. All subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual service term. Product and other revenue is generated from the sale of on-premise appliances and end-point devices, including shipping and handling fees for our direct customers, and to a lesser extent from porting fees that enable customers to transfer their existing phone numbers. Beginning fiscal 2019, we recognize revenue from sales to direct end-customers and channel partners at the point in time that control transfers which is typically when we deliver the product or when all customer contractual provisions have been met, if any. Our distribution agreements with channel partners typically contain clauses for price protection and right of return. Prior to fiscal 2019, we deferred product revenue and related costs of revenue on these product channel sales until title was transferred to the end-customer. See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our subscription and services revenue and product and other revenue.\nCost of product and other revenue includes the costs associated with the manufacturing of our on-premise appliances and end-point devices, as well as personnel costs for employees and contractors, costs related to porting our customers' phone numbers to our service, shipping and handling costs, and allocated costs of facilities and information technology.\nSubscription and services gross margin of 69% was flat year-over-year. Cost of subscription and services revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $4.7 million or 15% year-over-year, reflecting a $2.8 million increase in regulatory costs, primarily associated with changes made to our residential pricing structure in October 2017, and a $0.8 million increase in personnel-related costs and a $0.3 million increase in network infrastructure related costs.\nOur historical financial performance and key business metrics have been, and we expect that our financial performance and key business metrics in the future will be, primarily driven by the following factors.\n \u2022 an increase of $1.1 million in accounts receivable primarily due to timing of billing and our collection efforts \nOn February 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method, which resulted in timing and presentation changes affecting our consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations. Our financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the provisions under Topic 606. Comparative prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the historic accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. (See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.)\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 39\nStock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the equity award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of each RSU granted is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each stock purchase right under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d) is calculated based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant and the value of put and call options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nWe derived approximately 68% and 71% of our total revenue from Ooma Residential and approximately 28% and 22% from Ooma Business in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 52\nInventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded in cost of goods sold within the consolidated statement of operations during the period in which such write-downs are determined as necessary by management. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Inventory write-downs recorded for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not material.\nAnnualized Exit Recurring Revenue increased year-over-year due to an increase in the average revenue per core user, which was largely driven by the increase in our total core user base. We believe that AERR is an indicator of recurring subscription and services revenue for near-term future periods. We estimate our AERR by dividing our recurring quarterly subscription revenue (excluding Talkatone revenue) by the average number of core users each quarter, and annualize by multiplying by four. We then multiply that result by the number of core users at the end of the period to calculate AERR.\nInventories\nReconciliations of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures were as follows (in thousands):\nSubscription and services gross margin increased to 69% in fiscal 2018 as compared to 67% in fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher proportionate growth of subscription and services revenue. The improvement in gross margin was driven by higher revenues from Ooma Business and the benefits of scale on a larger core user base. Cost of subscription and services revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $1.8 million year-over-year, reflecting a $0.9 million increase in credit card processing fees, a $0.7 million increase in network infrastructure related costs, driven by our international expansion, and to a lesser extent increases in personnel and consultant costs that were partly offset by a decline in the Business Promoter cost of sales due to our sale of the Business Promoter service in August 2017.\n \u2022 Net loss was $14.6 million, compared to $13.1 million in fiscal 2018 and $12.9 million in fiscal 2017, reflecting continued investments in research and development, brand marketing and sales channels. \nOperating Activities\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, this Form 10-K contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net loss and Adjusted EBITDA (see above). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related taxes, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization of acquired intangibles, non-cash acquisition-related income tax benefit, and certain litigation costs that are not representative of the ordinary course of our business.\n \u2022 a net increase of $4.2 million in our inventory and related deferred costs to scale our business \nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 41\nSubscription and services gross margin may fluctuate from period-to-period based on the interplay of a number of factors, including the costs we pay to third-party telecommunications providers, the timing of capital expenditures and related depreciation charges, and changes in our headcount. We expect our subscription and services gross margin to increase over the long-term, in part as our business revenue becomes a larger portion of total subscription revenue.\nThe table below provides selected cash flow information, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nWe review the key metrics below to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Key business metrics exclude Business Promoter data for all periods presented because it is not part of our core cloud communications business. We believe that this change enables us to better evaluate the performance of our core cloud communications business in a given period compared to those in prior and future periods.\nNet Dollar Subscription Retention Rate was 99% for fiscal 2019, driven by growth in average revenue per user and net retention rate. This rate declined by 2% year-over-year due to minor changes in retention rate and lower growth in average revenue per user, primarily for residential customers. We believe that our net dollar subscription retention rate provides insight into our ability to retain and grow our subscription and services revenue, and is an indicator of the long-term value of our customer relationships and the stability of our revenue base. It measures the percentage year-over-year change in our recurring subscription revenue per core user (excluding Talkatone revenue), which is then adjusted by factoring in the percentage of our core users we have retained during the same period. Our net dollar subscription retention rate is affected by changes in average amounts that our core users pay to us, fluctuations in the number of our core users, and our core user churn rate.\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nRevenue Recognition\n (ii) our core user annual retention rate, which is calculated by: \n (i) our year-over-year percentage change in annual recurring revenue per core user, which is calculated by: \n \u2022 Total gross margin was 59%, flat from 59% in fiscal 2018 and up from 57% in fiscal 2017, driven by the higher growth of our subscription and services revenue as compared to product and other revenue. \nResearch and Development\n \u25aa calculating our monthly churn rate by dividing our churn in a month by the number of core users at the beginning of that month; and \nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017. Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $3.5 million or 10% year-over-year, due to a $3.7 million increase in sales commissions, a net $1.1 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount, coupled with a $0.6 million increase in facilities related costs and a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation. These higher expenses were offset in part by a net $2.6 million decrease in marketing activities, primarily Ooma Residential-related advertising expenses. The year-over-year growth in sales and marketing supported the expansion of our sales efforts to drive growth in our small business solutions.\n \u25aa determining our core user churn, by identifying the number of paying core users who terminate service during a month, excluding infant churn, which we define as office extensions and home users who terminate service prior to the end of the second full calendar month after their activation date; \nProduct and other revenue decreased $0.9 million or 7% year-over-year, primarily attributable to lower Ooma Residential-related sales, offset in part by growth in unit sales of smart security sensors and end-point devices.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $5.1 million or 21% year-over-year, primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount, a $1.0 million increase in facilities, supplies and equipment related costs and a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation. The year-over-year growth in research and development supported the continued development of our office platform, including international expansion, as well as adding new features and product offerings to our home security solution.\n \u25aa calculating our annual retention rate as one minus the sum of our monthly churn rates for the preceding 12-month period. \nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to manage our business, evaluate our performance and make planning decisions. We consider this measure to be a useful measure of our operating performance, because it contains adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers being the core operating performance, and are used by our management for that purpose. We also believe this measure enables us to better evaluate our performance by facilitating a meaningful comparison of our core operating results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance with competitors. Adjusted EBITDA represents net loss before interest and other income, non-cash income tax benefit, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and related taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and certain litigation costs that are not representative of the ordinary course of our business.\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had $42.6 million of total cash, cash equivalents and investments. Our primary source of cash is receipts from sales to our customers. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditure, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results and core business operations. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful measures of the operating performance of the Company, because they contain adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers to be our core operating performance, and are used by our management for that purpose. We also believe that these non-GAAP financial measures allow for a better evaluation of our performance by facilitating a meaningful comparison of our core operating results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance of a company.\nResearch and development expenses are focused on developing new and expanded features for our services and improvements to our platform and backend architecture. Research and development is expensed as incurred and consists primarily of personnel costs for employees and contractors, allocated costs of facilities and information technology, software tools and product certification. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars.\n\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018\nRefer to Note 8: Stock-Based Compensation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our estimates related to stock-based compensation.\nInvesting in long-term revenue growth. We believe that our total addressable market opportunity is large and we intend to continue investing in sales and marketing to grow our user base. However, we expect the markets in which we conduct our business will remain highly competitive. We recently entered the home security market and face significant competition from incumbent providers promoting their own offerings. We also expect to continue investing in research and development to enhance our platform and develop additional connected services. We may evaluate additional possible acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to our business.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nProduct and other revenue gross margin of negative 20% decreased year-over-year from negative 16% due to a decrease in the sale of end-point devices and related porting fees. The decrease in cost of product and other revenue of $0.6 million reflected higher freight costs due to increased direct consumer shipments in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.\nSubscription and services revenue increased $14.4 million or 14% year-over-year, primarily driven by a 5% increase in our core users and in part by changes to our residential pricing structure that were implemented in October 2017. Year-over-year revenue growth reflected a combined 19% increase in subscription and services revenue from Ooma Business and Ooma Residential that was offset in part by a decline in revenue from Talkatone and the non-existence of revenue from Business Promoter (due to the sale of the Business Promoter service in August 2017). Revenue earned from Business Promoter was approximately $1.8 million for fiscal 2018.\nOverall, the decrease in operating cash flow from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in cash-based operating expenses (see Results of Operations\u201d above) coupled with increased inventory procurement to scale our business.\n\nCore Users increased 5% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by growth in business users. We believe that the number of our core users is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our anticipated future subscription and services revenue. We define our core users as the number of active residential user accounts and office user extensions. We believe that the relationship that we establish with our core users positions us to sell additional premium communications services and other new connected services to them.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nCash generated from financing activities include net proceeds from common stock issuances related to employee stock benefit plans and proceeds from borrowings, if any, under our credit facilities, if any. Cash used in financing activities includes payment of shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), repayment of debt and capital leases and payment of acquisition-related earn-outs.\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash used in investing activities was $2.2 million, which consisted of purchases of short-term investments of $49.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of $2.5 million, and a business acquisition for $1.4 million, offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments totaling $51.0 million. The decrease in cash outflow from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was attributable primarily to activity in our investment portfolio, reflecting a decrease in investment purchases and an increase in maturities.\nRevenue\nCosts and expenses included stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nExecutive Overview\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 40\nAt each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected future demand, actual historical experience and certain other factors. We adjust our inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value. In determining the adequacy of inventory write-downs, we analyze the following, among other things:\nProduct and other gross margin may fluctuate from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including total units shipped during a period as compared to the direct costs of production and relatively fixed personnel costs incurred during the period. We sell our on-premise appliances at an aggressive price point to facilitate the adoption of our platform and services. We expect our product and other gross margin to continue to be negative for the foreseeable future.\nQuarterly Results of Operations and Trends\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 46\n\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2019 increased $4.6 million or 16% year-over-year, primarily due to a $3.9 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount and our recent acquisitions, as well as a $0.3 million increase in non-recurring engineering and license costs. The year-over-year growth in research and development reflects continued enhancements to Ooma Business as well as adding new features and product offerings to our Smart Security solution, including the Butterfleye smart camera.\nInvesting Activities\nby:\n \u2022 Expected Term. We do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time stock-based awards have been exercisable since the completion of our IPO in July 2015. As a result, we used the simplified method to calculate the expected term estimate based on the vesting and contractual terms of the option. Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the average of the stock-based award's weighted average vesting period and its contractual term. \nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $0.4 million for fiscal 2019, primarily associated with our acquisition of Voxter. We did not record a provision or benefit for income taxes in fiscal years 2018 and 2017. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. See Note 9: Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nFor fiscal 2018, our net loss of $13.1 million included non-cash charges of $13.3 million primarily related to stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization. Operating asset and liability changes for fiscal 2018 included:\n \u2022 Cash used in operations was $3.9 million, compared to cash provided from operations of $3.2 million in fiscal 2018 and $0.4 million in fiscal 2017. Cash usage reflects our investments in operating expenses to execute on our growth initiatives. \nBeginning with fiscal 2019, we refer to Ooma Office and Ooma Enterprise collectively as Ooma Business. Ooma Residential includes Ooma Telo basic and premier services as well as our Smart Security solutions. Beginning in fiscal 2018, we modified our key business metrics to focus on data related to our core business which is Ooma Residential and Ooma Business. Accordingly, our key business metrics below for core users, annualized exit recurring revenue and net dollar subscription retention rate reflect this change and exclude Business Promoter users and revenue for all periods presented.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe may in the future make investments in or acquisitions of businesses or technologies, which may require the use of cash. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisition of Voxter for upfront cash consideration of approximately $2.4 million, net of cash acquired of $0.1 million, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we invested $1.3 million in cash to a small privately-held technology company, in exchange for an 18-month convertible promissory note (see Note 6: Balance Sheet Components of the notes to our consolidated financial statements).\nGrowth in additional services. We believe that there is significant opportunity for us to increase the additional subscription and services that our customers purchase from us in both the business and residential markets. Customers who purchase additional subscription and services from us generate more value to Ooma over the life of our customer relationship. In order to drive adoption of additional services, we will need to continue to enhance our existing solutions and develop new connected services. For example, we are investing to develop our comprehensive smart security solution and continue to invest in Ooma Business to launch additional features.\nRevenue. Our total revenue has grown sequentially each quarter due to the continued growth in our subscriber base driven by an increase in our core users.\n \u2022 customer demand; \nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flows and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our future consolidated financial statements will be affected to the extent that our actual results materially differ from these estimates. Note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\n \u2022 a net increase of $1.5 million in prepaid expenses and other assets due to the timing of certain payments \nSee Item 1. Business above for additional information regarding our business, products and services, competitive market and regulatory matters.\nWe drive the adoption of our platform by providing communications solutions to the large and growing markets for business, residential and mobile users, and then accelerate growth by offering new and innovative connected services to our user base. Our customers adopt our platform by making a one-time purchase of one of our on-premise appliances, connecting the appliance to the internet, and activating services, for which they primarily pay on a monthly basis. We believe we have achieved high levels of customer retention and loyalty by delivering exceptional quality and customer satisfaction.\nThe increase in operating cash flow from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increased cash collections from our customers, driven by revenue growth year-over-year, as well as favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nGross Margin. Over the past eight fiscal quarters, our gross margin has fluctuated between 57% and 62% due to changes in our product mix and the introduction of new products.\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.9) million, compared to ($0.2) million in fiscal 2018 and ($1.4) million in fiscal 2017. \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees and contractors. In addition, it includes professional service fees, legal fees, acquisition-related transaction costs and earn-outs, and allocated costs of facilities and information technology. We expect our general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenue.\n\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 50\nWe do not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities such as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\nProduct and other revenue increased $0.3 million or 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase for sales of our smart security products offset in part by a decline in sales of on-premise appliances and other accessories.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation and related taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, certain litigation costs, non-cash income tax benefits, and change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration; \nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 42\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 49\nStock-Based Compensation\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 47\n\nSales Reserves. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns from end users and customer sales incentives at the time the related revenue is recognized. Product returns and customer sales incentives are estimated based on our historical experience, current trends and expectations regarding future experience. Trends are influenced by product life cycles, new product introductions, market acceptance of products, the type of customer, seasonality and other factors. Product return and sales incentive rates may fluctuate over time but are sufficiently predictable to allow our management to estimate expected future amounts. If actual future returns and sales incentives differ from past experience, additional reserves may be required. To date, actual results have not been materially different from our estimates.\nDuring fiscal 2019, financing activities consisted of payments of $2.9 million related to shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs, offset by proceeds of $2.9 million from common stock issuances under our employee stock plans.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $0.6 million or 4% year-over-year, reflecting a $1.0 million increase in personnel related costs and stock-based compensation costs, driven by higher headcount, offset in part by a $0.5 million decrease in legal expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOoma creates powerful connected experiences for businesses and consumers. Our smart cloud-based SaaS platform serves as a communications hub, which offers cloud-based communications solutions, smart security and other connected services. Our business and residential solutions deliver our proprietary PureVoice high-definition voice quality, advanced functionality and integration with mobile devices, at competitive pricing and value. Our platform helps create smart workplaces and homes by providing communications, monitoring, security, automation, productivity and networking infrastructure applications.\nWe use a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Deferred tax assets associated with our unrecognized tax benefits were fully offset by a valuation allowance as of January 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFiscal 2019 Highlights\nOn February 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method, which resulted in timing and presentation changes affecting our consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations. Product revenue for sales made through our channel partners is recognized when we deliver product to our partners (sell-in basis) rather than deferring recognition until resale by the partners to the end customers (sell-through basis). We also capitalize a significant portion of our sales commission costs as an incremental cost of obtaining a customer contract and amortize them to sales and marketing expense over an expected period of benefit of five years. In prior years, all sales commissions were expensed as incurred. Our financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the provisions under Topic 606. Comparative prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the historic accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. (See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.)\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect other non-operating expenses, net of other non-operating income, including net interest and other income/expense; and \n \u2022 Subscription and services revenue has increased as a percentage of our total revenue over the last three years, from approximately 87% in fiscal 2017 to 90% in fiscal 2019. We expect subscription and services revenue to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. \nIncome Taxes\nThe table below provides selected cash flow information, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nAs of January 31, 2019, our total future expected payment obligations under non-cancelable operating leases with terms longer than one year were approximately $4.6 million. See Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a table of contractual obligations, including payments due by period. As of January 31, 2019, non-cancelable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers totaled approximately $4.2 million.\nThe determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables, of which the most subjective were estimated as follows:\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn March 2018, we acquired Voxter, a provider of customizable UCaaS offerings for mid-market and enterprise businesses for upfront cash consideration of $2.4 million, net of cash acquired of $0.1 million. (See Note 12: Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). We believe Voxter's UCaaS offerings, which we refer to as Ooma Enterprise, will complement our Ooma Office solution and allow us to meet the needs of larger organizations. Although Ooma Enterprise was not material to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2019, we expect it to be a strategic growth initiative for our business long-term.\n \u2022 product life cycles and obsolescence, and; \nFinancing Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018. Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2019 increased $3.5 million or 9% year-over-year, primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in personnel related costs, driven by higher headcount and our business acquisitions, coupled with a $1.6 million increase in marketing activities, and a $0.3 million increase in facilities related costs, driven by our continued business expansion. These increases were offset in part by a $2.5 million year-over-year decrease in sales commissions expenses, as we started capitalizing these costs in fiscal 2019 under the new Topic 606 accounting rules. The year-over-year increase in sales and marketing reflects our strategy to drive continued growth in Ooma Business and create further market awareness of our products.\nOur investing activities include short-term investment activities, capital expenditures and business acquisitions. Our capital expenditures have primarily been for general business purposes, including expansion of our network operations centers, computer equipment used internally, website development and leasehold improvements as we have expanded our office space to accommodate our growth in headcount.\n \u2022 Total revenue was $129.2 million, up 13% year-over-year, reflecting a 5% increase in core users, primarily driven by Ooma Business. We have grown our core users 14% from approximately 858,000 as of January 31, 2017 to approximately 976,000 as of January 31, 2019. \nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 51\nOur subscription and services gross margin is significantly higher than product and other gross margin. As a result, any significant change in the mix between subscription and services revenue and product and other revenue will cause our total gross margin to change. For example, in periods where we sell significantly more on-premise appliances, we would expect our total gross margin to be impacted.\nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 43\n \u2022 product acceptance and competitiveness in the marketplace; \nSubscription and services revenue consists primarily of recurring subscription fees from customers accessing our communications solutions, such as Ooma Residential, Ooma Business and other subscriptions, and to a lesser extent from payments associated with advertisements through the Talkatone mobile application. We expect our subscription and services revenue to continue to grow as we continue to expand our core user base, driven primarily by growth in Ooma Business.\nRevenue\nProduct and other revenue consists primarily of sales of our on-premise appliances and end-point devices used in connection with our services, including shipping and handling fees for our direct customers, and to a lesser extent from porting fees we charge our customers to enable them to transfer their existing phone numbers to Ooma Business or Residential. We expect our product and other revenue to remain relatively flat or grow modestly on a year-over-year basis.\nThe following table sets forth our key metrics for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 increased $2.4 million or 16% year-over-year, mainly reflecting a $1.8 million increase in personnel related costs that were driven by higher headcount, as well as a $0.3 million increase in acquisition-related transaction expenses.\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash used in financing activities was $0.5 million, which consisted of payments of $2.4 million related to shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs, offset by proceeds of $1.9 million from common stock issuances under our employee stock plans.\n \u25aa determining the annual recurring revenue per core user by dividing annual recurring revenue for the period ended by the number of core users at the end of that particular period; and \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider any expenses for assets being depreciated and amortized that are necessary to our business; \nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nSales and Marketing\n \u25aa calculating the year-over-year percentage change in annual recurring revenue per core user by dividing the current period recurring revenue per core user by the annual recurring revenue per core user for the same period in the prior year. \nWe calculate our estimated net dollar subscription retention rate for our core users by multiplying:\n \u2022 Subscription and services revenue from Ooma Business and Ooma Residential grew 51% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. \nCost of subscription and services revenue includes payments made for third-party network operations and telecommunications services, Federal Universal Service Fund contributions, credit card processing fees, costs to maintain third-party data centers, including co-location fees for the right to place our servers in third-party data centers, depreciation and maintenance of servers and equipment, personnel costs associated with customer care and network operations support, and allocated costs of facilities and information technology.\nWe derived approximately 71% and 72% of our total revenue from Ooma Residential and approximately 22% and 16% from Ooma Business in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n \u2022 a decrease of $1.9 million in accounts receivable primarily due to timing of billing and our cash collections, driven by lower revenue from Talkatone during fiscal 2018 as well as due to the sale of the Business Promoter service in August 2017 \n \u2022 technological innovations \nKey Business Metrics\n\n \u2022 an increase of $5.3 million in other current and non-current asses primarily due to the capitalization of sales commissions under Topic 606 \n \u2022 an increase of $8.2 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities to support the growth of our business, including higher headcount \nOoma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 44\nCore user growth. Our core user growth is a key indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our anticipated future subscription and services revenue, especially Ooma Business.\nWe derive revenue from two sources: (1) subscription and services revenue, which is generated from the sale of subscription plans and other services; and (2) product and other revenue. Our financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the provisions under Topic 606. Comparative prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, the historic accounting standard in effect for the prior periods presented.\nLow core user churn. We believe that maintaining our current low core user churn is an important factor in our ability to continue to improve our financial performance and is a distinguishing advantage over many of our competitors. We focus on providing high-quality services and support to our users so they are motivated to remain with us. Our core user churn rate is higher for Ooma Business customers than Ooma Residential customers, which is driven in part by the failure rate of small businesses. Accordingly, we expect that our overall core user churn rate will increase if sales of our business products increase relative to sales of residential products.\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018\n\n \u2022 historical sales; \nAdoption of the new Topic 606 revenue recognition rules resulted in a $0.2 million increase to revenue for fiscal 2019 as compared to what would have been recognized under the legacy Topic 605 rules. See Note 3: Recent Accounting Standards in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is January 31, and we refer to our fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 as fiscal 2019, our fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 as fiscal 2018, and our fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 as fiscal 2017. All other references to years are references to calendar years.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only to aid an understanding of our operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that the adjustments relate to items that the Company generally expects to continue to recognize. The adjustment of these items should not be construed as an inference that the adjusted gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, both GAAP financial measures of Ooma's financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together.\n \u2022 Expected Stock Price Volatility. As we do not have a significant trading history for our common stock, we determined the expected volatility using a combination of the average historical volatility of a group of comparable publicly traded companies and our own common stock. \nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOperating expenses\nOperating Expenses. Our quarterly operating expenses in absolute dollars have increased significantly from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019, primarily driven by growing headcount and personnel-related expenses, as well as marketing and advertising expenses associated with our efforts to increase our overall subscriber base and product sales.\nProduct and other revenue gross margin of negative 30% decreased year-over-year from negative 20% due to a $0.4 million increase in freight charges, including recently imposed tariffs, as well as a $0.3 million increase in material product costs and a $0.2 million increase in other period costs.\nConsolidated Statement of Operations: Comparison of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in tables are in thousands)\n \u2022 a net decrease of $0.3 million in our inventory and related deferred costs, reflecting lower inventory levels at channel partners \nCost of revenue and gross margin\n \u2022 forecast sales; \nFor fiscal 2019, our net loss of $14.6 million included non-cash charges of $12.3 million primarily related to stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization. Operating asset and liability changes for fiscal 2019 included:\nOur contracts with customers typically contain multiple performance obligations that consist of product(s) and related communications services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The contract transaction price is then allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price ( SSP\u201d) basis. We determine the SSP for our communications services based on observable historical stand-alone sales to customers, for which we require that a substantial majority of selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We do not have a directly observable SSP for our on-premise appliance and end-point devices, and therefore we establish SSP based on our best estimates and judgments, considering company-specific factors such as pricing strategies, estimated product and other costs, and bundling and discounting practices. The determination of SSP is made through consultation with and approval by our management. As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and the timing of our revenue recognition could be affected.\nThe following table sets forth selected quarterly financial data for each of the eight quarterly periods ended January 31, 2019 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nSales and marketing expenses are the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of personnel costs for employees and contractors directly associated with sales and marketing activities, internet, television, radio advertising fees, public relations expenses, commissions we pay to internal sales personnel, third-party sales entities and resellers, trade show expenses, travel expenses, marketing and promotional activities and allocated costs of facilities and information technology. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue as well as in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business.", "item_7_tables": "Table 136: <table> <tr>
