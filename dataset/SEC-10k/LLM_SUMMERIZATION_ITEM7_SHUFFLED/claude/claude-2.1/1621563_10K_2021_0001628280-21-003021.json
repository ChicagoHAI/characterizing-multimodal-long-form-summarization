Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 5, 2020, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nOverview\nWe are one of the fastest growing construction materials companies in the United States, with a 63% increase in revenue between the year ended January 2, 2016 (the year of our initial public offering) and the year ended January 2, 2021. Within our markets, we offer customers a single-source provider for construction materials and related downstream products through our vertical integration. Our materials include aggregates, which we supply across the United States, and in British Columbia, Canada, and cement, which we supply to surrounding states along the Mississippi River from Minnesota to Louisiana. In addition to supplying aggregates to customers, we use a portion of our materials internally to produce ready-mix concrete and asphalt paving mix, which may be sold externally or used in our paving and related services businesses. Our vertical integration creates opportunities to increase aggregates volumes, optimize margin at each stage of production and provide customers with efficiency gains, convenience and reliability, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage.\nSince our inception in 2009, we have completed dozens of acquisitions, which are organized into 11 operating companies that make up our three distinct operating segments-West, East and Cement. We operate in 21 U.S. states and in British Columbia, Canada and currently have assets in 23 U.S. states and British Columbia, Canada. The map below illustrates our geographic footprint:\nBusiness Trends and Conditions\nThe U.S. construction materials industry is composed of four primary sectors: aggregates; cement; ready-mix concrete; and asphalt paving mix. Each of these materials is widely used in most forms of construction activity. Participants in these sectors typically range from small, privately-held companies focused on a single material, product or market to publicly traded multinational corporations that offer a wide array of construction materials and services. Competition is constrained in part by the distance materials can be transported efficiently, resulting in predominantly local or regional operations. Due to the lack of product differentiation, competition for all of our products is predominantly based on price and, to a lesser extent, quality of products and service. As a result, the prices we charge our customers are not likely to be materially different from the prices charged by other producers in the same markets. Accordingly, our profitability is generally dependent on the level of demand for our materials and products and our ability to control operating costs.\nOur revenue is derived from multiple end-use markets including public infrastructure construction and private residential and nonresidential construction. Public infrastructure includes spending by federal, state, provincial and local governments for roads, highways, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. Public infrastructure projects have\nhistorically been a relatively stable portion of state and federal budgets. Residential and nonresidential construction consists of new construction and repair and remodel markets. Any economic stagnation or decline, which could vary by local region and market, could affect our results of operations. Our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical changes in construction spending, especially in the private sector. From a macroeconomic view, we see positive indicators for the construction sector, including positive trends in highway obligations, housing starts and construction employment.\nTransportation infrastructure projects, driven by both federal and state funding programs, represent a significant share of the U.S. construction materials market. Federal funds are allocated to the states, which are required to match a portion of the federal funds they receive. Federal highway spending uses funds predominantly from the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which derives its revenue from taxes on diesel fuel, gasoline and other user fees. The dependability of federal funding allows the state departments of transportation to plan for their long term highway construction and maintenance needs. Funding for the existing federal transportation funding program was extended in late 2020 through 2021. With the nation's infrastructure aging, there is increased demand by states and municipalities for long-term federal funding to support the construction of new roads, highways and bridges in addition to the maintenance of the existing infrastructure.\nIn addition to federal funding, state, county and local agencies provide highway construction and maintenance funding. Our four largest states by revenue, Texas, Utah, Kansas and Missouri, represented approximately 25%, 14%, 13% and 9%, respectively, of our total revenue in 2020. The following is a summary of key funding initiatives in those states:\n\u2022According to the Texas Department of Transportation ( TXDOT\u201d), annual funding available for transportation infrastructure, including state and federal funding, is estimated to average $14.9 billion in total for fiscal year 2021 (which commenced September 1, 2020) and fiscal year 2022 combined. Further, the 2021 Unified Transportation Program ( UTP\u201d) approved by the Texas Transportation Commission in September 2020 provides for $75 billion through fiscal year 2030 to fund transportation projects; more than double the fiscal year 2016 level, which was prior to the Proposition 1 and Proposition 7 funding initiatives. The funding available in any given year is separate and distinct from lettings, or the process of providing notice, issuing proposals, receiving proposals, and awarding contracts. In January 2021, TXDOT updated its fiscal year 2021 lettings estimate to $9.6 billion up from $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2020 and $8.9 billion in fiscal year 2019. Longer term, TXDOT has indicated a target of $8 billion per year in total state and local lettings. The Texas Comptroller released its biennial revenue estimate for fiscal year 2022 - 2023 in January 2021 and expects economic output to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, and despite revenue shortfalls due to COVID-19 it is expected that the state highway fund will be granted its full allotment of $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2021 and 2022 from Proposition 7 funding.\n\u2022In December 2020, Utah updated its revenue estimate for transportation funding to $639 million in fiscal year 2021 (which commenced July 1, 2020) up from $614 million in fiscal year 2020, with growth driven by increases in vehicle registration fees, diesel fuel tax and other revenue sources. In January 2020, the Utah Department of Transportation increased fees on electric and hybrid vehicles by 50% in 2020 and another 33% in 2021 and launched an alternative to a road usage charge program for those vehicles in the form of a pay per mile charge. In December 2019, Utah passed new legislation imposing a 4.85% sales tax on gas purchases and a 6 cents per gallon increase to the diesel tax, with an additional 4 cents per gallon diesel tax increase in 2022. The tax is estimated to generate an additional $170 million for transportation investment in 2021.\n\u2022In January 2021, the Governor of Kansas submitted a revised budget for fiscal year 2021 (which commenced July 1, 2020) and an initial budget recommendation for fiscal year 2022 with $1.9 billion in transportation funding budgeted in 2021 and $2.2 billion for 2022. Transfers from the State Highway Fund ( SHF\u201d) to the State General Fund ( SGF\u201d) are expected to be eliminated by fiscal year 2023 with $134 million currently estimated to be transferred to the SGF in fiscal year 2021 and $67 million in fiscal year 2022. The elimination of transfers out of the SHF is expected to help pave the way for the issuance of new transportation bonds and keep funds available to continue moving forward the 10-year, $10 billion Eisenhower Legacy Plan that was approved by the Kansas Legislature in early 2020. The Eisenhower Legacy Plan selects new modernization and expansion projects every two years, requires previously selected projects under the prior T-Works program to be let prior to July 1, 2023 and levies 16.2% of the state sales tax for the benefit of the SHF.\n\u2022In December 2020, new Missouri legislation was submitted that calls for five consecutive years of a two-cent gas tax increase starting in January 2022, which would raise an incremental $100 million of revenue annually; Missouri currently has the second-lowest motor fuel tax in the United States at 17 cents per gallon. Despite the impact of COVID-19, the Missouri Department of Transportation had one of its strongest construction programs on record with payments to contractors of $821 million in calendar year-to-date November 2020 versus $662 million in the prior period and has now scheduled or is scheduled to let during the remainder of fiscal year 2021 (which commenced July 1, 2020) the entire $360 million of construction projects delayed in early 2020 as a result of COVID-19.\nThe table below sets forth additional details regarding our four key states, including growth rates as compared to the U.S. as a whole:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Projected Industry Growth by End Market </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue by End Market(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 to 2023(2) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of </td> <td> </td> <td>Residential and </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Our Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Nonresidential </td> <td> </td> <td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td>Nonresidential </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Construction\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utah </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kansas </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Missouri </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n(1)Percentages based on our revenue by state for the year ended January 2, 2021 and management's estimates as to end markets.\n(2)Source: 2019 PCA\n(3)Calculated using a weighted average based on each state's percentage contribution to our total revenue.\nUse and consumption of our products fluctuate due to seasonality. Nearly all of the products used by us, and by our customers, in the private construction or public infrastructure industries are used outdoors. Our highway operations and production and distribution facilities are also located outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in particular extended rainy and cold weather in the spring and fall and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, heavy snows and flooding, can adversely affect our business and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year typically result in higher activity and revenue levels during those quarters. The first quarter of our fiscal year typically has lower levels of activity due to weather conditions.\nWe are subject to commodity price risk with respect to price changes in liquid asphalt and energy, including fossil fuels and electricity for aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete and asphalt paving mix production, natural gas for hot mix asphalt production and diesel fuel for distribution vehicles and production related mobile equipment. Liquid asphalt escalator provisions in most of our private and commercial contracts limit our exposure to price fluctuations in this commodity. We often obtain similar escalators on public infrastructure contracts. In addition, we enter into various firm purchase commitments, with terms generally less than one year, for certain raw materials.\nFinancial Highlights- Year ended January 2, 2021\nThe principal factors in evaluating our financial condition and operating results for the year ended January 2, 2021 are:\n\u2022Net revenue increased 5.1% or $104.1 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily resulting from organic growth and to a lesser extent, contributions from our acquisitions.\n\u2022Our operating income increased 5.4% or $11.6 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, as pricing and volume increases exceeded the increases in cost of revenue.\n\u2022In August 2020, we issued $700.0 million of 5.250% senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes\u201d), resulting in net proceeds of $690.4 million, after related fees and expenses. The proceeds from the 2029 Notes were used to redeem the $650.0 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d) at par.\nComponents of Operating Results\nTotal Revenue\nWe derive our revenue predominantly by selling construction materials and products and providing paving and related services. Construction materials consist of aggregates and cement. Products consist of related downstream products, including ready-mix concrete, asphalt paving mix and concrete products. Paving and related services that we provide are primarily asphalt paving services.\nRevenue derived from the sale of construction materials is recognized when risks associated with ownership have passed to unaffiliated customers. Typically this occurs when products are shipped. Product revenue generally includes sales of aggregates, cement and related downstream products and other materials to customers, net of discounts or allowances and taxes, if any.\nRevenue derived from paving and related services is recognized on the percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the cost incurred to date compared to estimated total cost of each project. This method is used because management considers cost incurred to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change over the life of the contract.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nThe key components of our operating costs and expenses consist of the following:\nCost of Revenue (excluding items shown separately)\nCost of revenue consists of all direct production and delivery costs and primarily includes labor, repair and maintenance, utilities, raw materials, fuel, transportation, subcontractor costs, and royalties. Our cost of revenue is directly affected by fluctuations in commodity energy prices, primarily diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. As a result, our adjusted cash gross profit margins can be significantly affected by changes in the underlying cost of certain raw materials if they are not recovered through corresponding changes in revenue. We attempt to limit our exposure to changes in commodity energy prices by entering into forward purchase commitments when appropriate. In addition, we have sales price adjustment provisions that provide for adjustments based on fluctuations outside a limited range in certain energy-related production costs. These provisions are in place for most of our public infrastructure contracts, and we seek to include similar price adjustment provisions in our private contracts.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs, including stock-based compensation charges, for our sales and marketing, administration, finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and certain managerial employees. Additional expenses include audit, consulting and professional fees, travel, insurance, rental costs, property taxes and other corporate and overhead expenses.\nDepreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion\nOur business is capital intensive. We carry property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet at cost, net of applicable depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis or based on the economic usage over the estimated useful life of the asset. The general range of depreciable lives by category, excluding mineral reserves, which are depleted based on the units of production method on a site-by-site basis, is as follows:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings and improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>10 - 30 </td> <td>years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plant, machinery and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>7 - 20 </td> <td>years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 7 </td> <td>years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Truck and auto fleet </td> <td> </td> <td>5 - 8 </td> <td>years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile equipment and barges </td> <td> </td> <td>6 - 8 </td> <td>years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Landfill airspace and improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>10 - 30 </td> <td>years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>4 - 20 </td> <td>years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization expense is the periodic expense related to leasehold improvements and intangible assets. The intangible assets were recognized with certain acquisitions and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the underlying asset or the remaining lease term.\nAccretion expense is the periodic expense recorded for the accrued mining reclamation liabilities and landfill closure and post-closure liabilities using the effective interest method.\nResults of Operations\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") virus was first reported to have surfaced. COVID-19 has since spread globally, including to every state in the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. As construction activities were deemed essential businesses in all of our markets, we continued to operate while many businesses were forced to close or reduce operations. During 2020, our operating markets remained substantially unaffected by COVID-19, except for Kentucky and to a lesser degree, Vancouver, British Columbia. However, we believe its impact may negatively affect our operations in subsequent periods if construction activity in future periods slows due to COVID-19. Residential construction activity remains strong, particularly in the Houston and Salt Lake City areas, two of the largest metro areas in which we operate. We believe residential activity in our key markets will continue to be a driver for volumes in future periods. While Kentucky had experienced fiscal shortfalls prior to COVID-19, those shortfalls were extended by COVID-19, and subsequently, Kentucky suspended lettings of department of transportation projects for May and June, and subsequent lettings have been significantly reduced from prior levels. In the Vancouver, British Columbia area, the provincial government has cancelled or delayed certain infrastructure projects. Our cement segment has also been impacted by lower sales demand, which we believe to be related to COVID-19, notably in our southern markets. In most of our other markets, we have not experienced any significant delays or cancellations of projects. Typically, state revenues decrease as the economy slows, and ultimately, some infrastructure projects may be delayed or cancelled, which would reduce our revenues in future periods. In 2020, approximately 61% of our revenue was derived from the private construction market, and the remaining revenue from the public markets. In addition to the volume impact on the cement segment, our annual cement price increases were delayed in 2020 from April 1 to June 1 due to COVID-19. We continue to monitor our operations, the operations of our customers, and the recommendations of the various national, state and local governments in the areas in which we operate. We implemented work-from-home protocols at all of our administrative locations late in the first quarter of 2020, and while some locations have returned, other locations, including our headquarters location, continue to work remotely. In addition, we implemented additional safety measures specific to COVID-19 at all of our operating locations, which did not significantly increase our costs. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the national and local economies in which we operate, and ultimately our business, will depend on numerous developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. These events, as they continue to develop, could result in business disruption, including reduced revenues, profitability and cash flow.\nThe following discussion of our results of operations is focused on the key financial measures we use to evaluate the performance of our business from both a consolidated and operating segment perspective. Operating income and margins are discussed in terms of changes in volume, pricing and mix of revenue source (i.e., type of product sales or service revenue). We focus on operating margin, which we define as operating income as a percentage of net revenue, as a key metric when assessing the performance of the business, as we believe that analyzing changes in costs in relation to changes in revenue provides more meaningful insight into the results of operations than examining costs in isolation.\nOperating income (loss) reflects our profit after taking into consideration cost of revenue, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion and gain on sale of property, plant and equipment. Cost of revenue generally increases ratably with revenue, as labor, transportation costs and subcontractor costs are recorded in cost of revenue. In periods where our revenue growth occurs primarily through acquisitions, general and administrative expenses and depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion have historically grown ratably with revenue. However, as organic volumes increase, we expect these costs, as a percentage of revenue, to decrease. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue vary throughout the year due to the seasonality of our business.\nThe table below includes revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated. Operating income (loss) by segment is computed as earnings before interest, loss on debt financings, tax receivable agreement expense, gain on sale of business, other income / expense and taxes.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the definition of and the reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nNet revenue increased $104.1 million in the year ended January 2, 2021, primarily resulting from organic growth in our aggregates and ready-mix concrete operations. Of the increase in net revenue, $80.5 million was from increased sales of products, $19.7 million from increased sales of materials and $3.9 million from increased service revenue. We generated organic volume growth of 3.6%, 5.0% and 4.7% in aggregates, ready-mix concrete and asphalt, respectively, during 2020 over the prior year period, while our organic cement volumes declined 4.6% compared to 2019. We had organic price growth in our cement, ready-mix and asphalt lines of business of 1.5%, 4.7% and 1.4%, respectively, during 2020. Operating income increased by $11.6 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily as net revenue gains exceeded increases in costs of revenue and general and administrative expenses.\nFor the year ended January 2, 2021, our operating margin percentage remained flat as compared to the year ended December 28, 2019, due to the items noted above. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, increased by $23.6 million in the year ended January 2, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 28, 2019.\nAs a vertically-integrated company, we include intercompany sales from materials to products and from products to services when assessing the operating results of our business. We refer to revenue inclusive of intercompany sales as gross revenue. These intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Gross revenue by line of business was as follows:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue by product*: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregates </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>636,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>593,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cement </td> <td> </td> <td>266,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,541) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ready-mix concrete </td> <td> </td> <td>668,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>608,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asphalt </td> <td> </td> <td>377,742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>369,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paving and related services </td> <td> </td> <td>639,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>603,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>(256,515) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(227,506) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,009) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,332,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,222,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n* Revenue by product includes intercompany and intracompany sales transferred at market value.

In 2020, increases in our northern Texas and Virginia markets were partially offset by organic aggregate volumes declines in Missouri as flood repair work in 2020 was less than in 2019 and Kentucky due to COVID-19 impacts. Overall, our average sales price in 2020 decreased over 2019 primarily as the product mix shifted away from higher priced flood repair products to lower priced products and the impact of lower priced acquisition related sales volumes in Texas. For the year ended January 2, 2021, our aggregate volumes increased primarily due to acquisition volumes, and to a lesser extent, due to increased organic volumes. Aggregate volumes growth was attributable to organic growth in both the West and East segments. Organic aggregate volumes increased 3.6% in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in our North Texas, Intermountain West and Kansas markets. Aggregate average sales prices of $10.77 per ton decreased 2.0% in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower priced products in our Missouri markets and acquisition related volumes noted above.\nRevenue from cement decreased $8.5 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, organic cement volumes decreased 4.6% and organic cement average sales prices increased 1.5%, respectively, as compared to 2019.\nRevenue from ready-mix concrete increased $60.3 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, our ready-mix volumes increased 5.0% and our average sales prices increased 4.7%. These volume and price increases in 2020 occurred in both the West and East segments. Volumes in the Intermountain, Texas and Kansas geographies were impacted by more favorable weather conditions during 2020 as compared to 2019.\nRevenue from asphalt increased $8.1 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, organic pricing increased 1.4%, with strong pricing gains in the Kansas and North Texas geographies. Further, in 2020, we had strong volume increases in North Texas offset by decreases in Kentucky due to COVID-19 impacts.\nOther Financial Information\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nOur general and administrative expenses in 2020 increased $32.2 million over 2019, due primarily to increased incentive compensation expenses, and expenses recognized in connection with the transition of our chief executive officer. Our stock based compensation expense increased $8.5 million over 2019, primarily due to additional equity grants related to the transition of our chief executive officer.\nLoss on Debt Financings\nIn August 2020, we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2029 Notes to redeem all of the outstanding 2023 Notes. In connection with that transaction, charges of $4.1 million were recognized in fiscal 2020. The charges included $0.8 million for the write-off of unamortized original issue discount and $3.3 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees.\nIn March 2019, we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 6.500% senior notes due March 15, 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\") to redeem all of the outstanding 8.500% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d). In connection with this transaction, charges of $14.6 million were recognized in fiscal 2019. The charges included $11.7 million for the applicable prepayment premium and $2.9 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees.\nTax Receivable Agreement (Benefit) Expense\nOur TRA benefit for the year ended January 2, 2021 was $7.6 million as compared to TRA expense of $16.2 million in the year ended December 28, 2019. Each year, we update our estimate as to when TRA payments will be made. When payments are made under the TRA, a portion of the payment made will be characterized as imputed interest under IRS regulations. We also updated our estimate of the state income tax rate that will be in effect at the date the TRA payments are made. As a result of updated state income tax rate, and the imputed interest limitation noted above, we decreased our TRA liability by $7.6 million as of January 2, 2021 and increased our TRA liability by $16.2 million as of December 28, 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur income tax benefit was $12.2 million for the year ended January 2, 2021 as compared to income tax expense of $17.1 million for the year ended December 28, 2019. Our effective tax rate for Summit Inc. differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to (1) unrecognized tax benefits, (2) changes in the valuation allowance, (3) state taxes, (4) tax depletion expense in excess of the expense recorded under U.S. GAAP, (5) the minority interest in the Summit Holdings partnership that is allocated outside of the Company and (6) various other items such as limitations on meals and entertainment, certain stock compensation and other costs. The Company's income tax provision is calculated under the provisions of the final regulations related to tax reform legislation, which may limit our ability to deduct interest expense in calculating our taxable income. All adjustments resulting from the issuance of the final regulations have been recorded.\nAs of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, Summit Inc. had a valuation allowance of $1.7 million and $1.7 million against our deferred tax assets, respectively.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWest Segment\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,147,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,022,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,191 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>176,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin percentage </td> <td> </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>271,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure below.\nNet revenue in the West segment increased $125.2 million in the year ended January 2, 2021, due to increases in net revenues in all lines of business. Organic aggregate volumes increased 4.4% in 2020 as compared to 2019, and organic aggregates average sales prices increased 1.8%, primarily due to product mix. Organic ready-mix concrete volumes increased 3.0% and our organic ready-mix concrete average sales prices increased 4.7%.\nThe West segment's operating income increased $67.3 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA increased $66.1 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. The increases in operating income and Adjusted EBITDA occurred as the weather conditions in 2020 have been generally more favorable as compared to 2019, which has resulted in operational efficiencies and increased sales volumes. The operating margin percentage in the West segment increased in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to the impact of the same factors noted above.\nGross revenue by product/service was as follows:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue by product*: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregates </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>282,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>244,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ready-mix concrete </td> <td> </td> <td>496,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>460,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asphalt </td> <td> </td> <td>277,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paving and related services </td> <td> </td> <td>436,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>359,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>(230,451) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(187,815) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,636) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,262,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,122,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n* Revenue by product includes intercompany and intracompany sales transferred at market value.

Aggregates volumes increased in 2020 mainly in our Texas markets which had organic growth coupled with increased acquisition volumes, and increased organic volumes in our Intermountain markets. In 2020, organic aggregate volumes decreased in the Vancouver, British Columbia area due to COVID-19 related delays in projects. Aggregates pricing in 2020 decreased 0.8% when compared to 2019, due to product mix primarily in our Texas markets, resulting primarily from the impact of lower prices on acquisition related volumes.\nGross revenue from ready-mix concrete in the West segment increased $36.0 million in 2020 over 2019. For the year ended January 2, 2021, organic ready-mix concrete prices increased 4.7%. For the year ended January 2, 2021, our ready-mix concrete organic volumes increased 3.0%, as volume increases in the Intermountain geographies were offset by volume decreases in North Texas. We continue to see strong residential volumes in the Salt Lake City and Houston areas, while volumes in the Permian basin area have decreased due to an economic slowdown in that area.\nGross revenue from asphalt in the West segment increased $31.2 million and asphalt volumes increased 10.3% in 2020, due to organic volume and price increases. Average sales prices for asphalt increased 2.9% in 2020. Gross revenue for paving and related services in the West segment increased by $76.4 million in 2020 due to greater activity in our North Texas markets, partially offset by our Intermountain geography and in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nPrior to eliminations of intercompany transactions, the net effect of volume and pricing changes on gross revenue for the year ended January 2, 2021 was approximately $79.4 million and $26.7 million, respectively.\nEast Segment\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>716,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>717,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,002) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>69,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,979) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin percentage </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,350) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, below.\nNet revenue in the East segment decreased $1.0 million in 2020 over 2019, as the decrease in asphalt and paving and services revenues exceeded the increase in aggregates and ready-mix concrete revenues. Organic aggregate volumes increased 3.0% in 2020 over 2019 levels, while organic aggregate pricing decreased 2.1%. Organic ready mix volumes and pricing increased 11.2% and 4.6%, respectively. Due to weakness in our Kentucky market, organic asphalt volumes decreased (7.9)% in 2020 over 2019 levels, and paving and related services revenue decreased $40.2 million.\nOperating income in the East segment decreased $32.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $25.4 million in 2020 over 2019, primarily due to lower margins on our asphalt and paving business, which resulted from decreased activity in Kentucky. In addition, our organic sales prices decreased in Missouri as 2019 included more higher priced flood and levy volumes. Further, our Kentucky operations worked to sell lower priced inventory to generate cash flow. Operating margin percentage in 2020 decreased to 9.7% from 14.2% in 2019, due to the items noted above.\nGross revenue by product/service was as follows:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue by product*: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregates </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>353,265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>348,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ready-mix concrete </td> <td> </td> <td>172,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asphalt </td> <td> </td> <td>100,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,129) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paving and related services </td> <td> </td> <td>203,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,219) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,697) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54,865) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>799,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>809,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,465) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n* Revenue by product includes intercompany and intracompany sales transferred at market value.

Aggregate volumes in 2020 increased 3.5%, primarily due to organic growth in our Kansas markets from wind farm and other large non-residential project activity, offset by volume decreases in our Missouri and Kentucky markets. Our volumes decreased in Kentucky as the state continues to deal with lower tax revenues that preceded COVID-19, and those revenues further decreased after the onset of COVID-19. Aggregates pricing decreased 2.1% in 2020 due primarily to product mix in Missouri and Kentucky.\nRevenue from ready-mix concrete in the East segment increased $24.3 million in 2020, as we realized higher organic volumes and pricing in all of our markets except Virginia. In 2020, ready-mix concrete volumes increased 11.2%, and average sales prices increased 4.6%.\nRevenue from asphalt decreased $23.1 million in 2020, which was mainly attributable to lower volumes in Kentucky, due to the items mentioned above, which more than offset strong asphalt volumes in Kansas. Asphalt pricing decreased 3.3% in 2020, as lower prices occurred in most of our markets. Paving and related service revenue decreased $40.2 million in 2020, primarily due to lower activity in Kentucky as noted above.\nPrior to eliminations of intercompany transactions, the net effect of volume and pricing changes on gross revenue for the year ended January 2, 2021 was approximately $6.9 million and $(1.3) million, respectively.\nCement Segment\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,082) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>55,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,362) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin percentage </td> <td> </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,482) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, below.\nNet revenue in the Cement segment decreased $20.1 million in 2020 over 2019, primarily due to decreased organic cement volumes of 4.6%. In addition, an explosion in April 2020 that shut down our solid waste processing facility contributed to the revenue decline in 2020 compared to 2019.\nThe Cement segment's operating income decreased $9.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $10.5 million in 2020. Although our sales volumes decreased, our production volumes increased as we did not purchase as much cement from\ninternational producers as we did in 2019. As such, our overall operating costs increased in 2020 over 2019. We believe our lower sales volumes are related to COVID-19, notably in our southern markets. Additionally, our solid waste processing facility that provides fuel for one of our plants remained closed to processing solid waste due to an explosion in April 2020, which also increased our operating costs. We expect to receive the necessary approvals to reopen that facility sometime late in the first quarter 2021.\nOperating margin percentage for the year ended January 2, 2021 decreased to 20.4% from 22.3% in the prior year, primarily due to the same factors noted above.\nGross revenue by product was as follows:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue by product*: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cement </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>266,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>275,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,541) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>3,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,541) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(76.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,082) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n* Revenue from waste processing and the elimination of intracompany transactions are included in Other.\nThe Cement segment's percent changes in sales volumes and pricing in 2020 from 2019 were as follows:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change in </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Volume </td> <td> </td> <td>Pricing </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cement </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue from cement decreased $8.5 million in 2020, as volume decreases of 4.6% were only partially offset by small organic cement pricing gains. We have historically implemented cement pricing increases in April each year; however, in 2020, those increases were deferred until June 1 as a result of COVID-19. We believe the decreases in volume are the result of COVID-19, primarily in southern markets, where the demand for cement is partially driven by the energy industry.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash on-hand, cash provided by our operations and amounts available for borrowing under our credit facilities and capital-raising activities in the debt capital markets. In addition to our current sources of liquidity, we have access to liquidity through public offerings of shares of our Class A common stock. To facilitate such offerings, in January 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that is effective for a term of three years and will expire in January 2023. The amount of Class A common stock to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific limit on the amount we may issue. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of the proceeds thereof, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we had $418.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $570.6 million of working capital as compared to $311.3 million and $497.0 million, respectively, at December 28, 2019. Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. There were no restricted cash balances as of January 2, 2021 or December 28, 2019.\nOur remaining borrowing capacity on our $345.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility as of January 2, 2021 was $329.1 million, which is net of $15.9 million of outstanding letters of credit, and is fully available to us within the terms and covenant requirements of our credit agreement.\nGiven the seasonality of our business, we typically experience significant fluctuations in working capital needs and balances throughout the year. Our working capital requirements generally increase during the first half of the year as we build up inventory and focus on repair and maintenance and other set-up costs for the upcoming season. Working capital levels then decrease as the construction season winds down and we enter the winter months, which is when we see significant inflows of cash from the collection of receivables.\nOur acquisition strategy has historically required us to raise capital through equity issuances or debt financings. As of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, our long-term borrowings totaled $1.9 billion, for which we incurred $91.2 million and $102.0 million of interest expense, respectively. Our senior secured revolving facility has been adequate to fund our\nseasonal working capital needs and certain acquisitions. We had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility as of January 2, 2021.\nWe believe we have access to sufficient financial resources from our liquidity sources to fund our business and operations, including contractual obligations, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, for at least the next twelve months. Our growth strategy contemplates future acquisitions for which we believe we have sufficient access to capital.\nAs market conditions warrant we may, from time to time, seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including Senior Notes and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities. Such transactions could be privately negotiated, open market transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may equate to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, which may reduce the trading liquidity of such class or series.\nOur Long-Term Debt\nPlease refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this report for detailed information regarding our long-term debt and senior secured revolving credit facility, scheduled maturities of long-term debt and affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, we are required to maintain a Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio that is no greater than 4.75 to 1.00. Our first lien net leverage ratio, for purposes of this maintenance requirement, is calculated following each quarter based on information for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial information is available by dividing our Consolidated First Lien Net Debt as of the end of such period by our Consolidated EBITDA for such period. Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of our senior secured credit facility is calculated in accordance with our presentation of Further Adjusted EBITDA below. We define Further Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA plus the EBITDA contribution of certain recent acquisitions.\nFor the years ended January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, our Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio was 0.51 to 1.00 and 0.80 to 1.00, respectively, based on consolidated first lien net debt of $254.5 million and $369.4 million as of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively, divided by Further Adjusted EBITDA of $496.5 million and $461.5 million for the years ended January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively. As of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA are not U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>141,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,330 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>103,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116,548 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,185) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,747 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>218,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203,305 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>451,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>409,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415,930 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion </td> <td> </td> <td>2,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,605 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt financings </td> <td> </td> <td>4,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement (benefit) expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,559) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,684) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of business </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,108) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs(a) </td> <td> </td> <td>2,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,238 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash compensation(b) </td> <td> </td> <td>28,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(c) </td> <td> </td> <td>2,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,800) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,247) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>485,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>461,462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>406,261 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA for certain acquisitions(d) </td> <td> </td> <td>11,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Further Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>496,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>461,462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n(a)Represents the transaction expenses associated with closed and probable acquisitions, consisting primarily of accounting, legal, valuation and financial advisory fees for the acquisitions.\n(b)Represents non-cash equity-based compensation granted to employees.\n(c)Represents the net (gain) loss recognized on assets identified for disposal.

We believe this provides our lenders with a more meaningful view of our EBITDA across all periods by making the information more comparable.\nAt January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, $1.9 billion of total debt was outstanding under our respective debt agreements. Summit LLC's senior secured credit facilities provide for term loans in an aggregate amount of $650.0 million and revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount of $345.0 million (the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). Summit LLC's domestic wholly-owned subsidiary companies are named as guarantors of the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

As a result of the extinguishment, charges of $14.6 million were recognized in the quarter ended March 30, 2019, which included charges of $11.7 million for the applicable redemption premium and $2.9 million for the write-off of deferred financing fees.\nOn June 1, 2017, the Issuers issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due June 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes were issued at par value, resulting in proceeds of $295.4 million, net of related fees and expenses. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year commencing on December 1, 2017.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nSummit LLC has credit facilities that provide for term loans in an aggregate amount of $650 million and revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount of $345 million (the \"Senior Secured Credit Facilities\"). Under the terms of Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as amended through February 2019, required principal payments of 0.25% of the refinanced aggregate amount of term debt are due on the last business day of each March, June, September and December. The unpaid principal balance is due in full on the maturity date of November 21, 2024.\nThe revolving credit facility bears interest per annum equal to, at Summit LLC's option, either (i) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus an applicable margin of 2.00% for base rate loans or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to\nReuters prior to the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs plus an applicable margin of 3.00% for LIBOR rate loans.\nThere were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of January 2, 2021 or December 28, 2019. As of January 2, 2021, we had remaining borrowing capacity of $329.1 million under the revolving credit facility, which is net of $15.9 million of outstanding letters of credit.

The majority of our sales occur in the spring, summer and fall and we typically incur an increase in accounts receivable (net billed and unbilled) during the second and third quarters of each year. This amount is typically converted to cash in the fourth and first quarters.\n\u2022The timing of payments associated with accounts payable and accrued expenses of cash, which is consistent with the seasonality of our business whereby we build-up inventory levels and incur repairs and maintenance costs to ready the business for increased sales volumes in the summer and fall. These costs are typically incurred in the first half of the year and paid by year-end. In addition, we made $99.6 million of interest payments in 2020. Our cash interest payments are expected to decrease slightly from this amount in 2021 and beyond.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $337.2 million primarily as a result of:\n\u2022Net income of $61.1 million, adjusted for $249.7 million of non-cash expenses, including $222.9 million of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, $20.4 million of share-based compensation and $16.0 million of change in deferred tax asset, net.\n\u2022Billed and unbilled accounts receivable increased by $31.5 million in fiscal 2019 as a result of increased revenue from our acquisitions as compared to fiscal 2018.\n\u2022The timing of payments associated with accounts payable and accrued expenses of cash, which is consistent with the seasonality of our business whereby we build-up inventory levels and incur repairs and maintenance costs to ready the business for increased sales volumes in the summer and fall. These costs are typically incurred in the first half of the year and paid by year-end. In addition, we made $104.6 million of interest payments in 2019.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended January 2, 2021, cash used for investing activities was $285.6 million, of which $123.5 million related to acquisitions completed in the period and $177.2 million was invested in capital expenditures, which was partially offset by $14.0 million of proceeds from asset sales.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, cash used for investing activities was $162.8 million, of which $5.4 million related to acquisitions completed in the period and $177.5 million was invested in capital expenditures, which was partially offset by $21.2 million of proceeds from asset sales.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended January 2, 2021, cash used in financing activities was $16.8 million. We received $700.0 million from proceeds of debt issuance, which was offset by $33.3 million of payments on acquisition related liabilities and $674.0 million in debt payments, which includes $14.4 million of finance lease cash payments. Our future payments under our finance lease obligations are expected to decrease slightly from 2020 levels.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $8.2 million. We received $19.1 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and $300.0 million from proceeds of debt issuance, which was offset by $33.9 million of payments on acquisition related liabilities and $270.2 million in debt payments.\nCash Paid for Capital Expenditures\nWe expended approximately $177.2 million in capital expenditures for the year ended January 2, 2021 compared to $177.5 million and $220.7 million in the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nWe estimate that we will invest between $200 million and $220 million in capital expenditures in 2021, which includes $25 - $35 million for our greenfield development projects. The timing of our greenfield expenditures is dependent upon the timing of when permits may be issued. We expect to fund our capital expenditure program through cash on hand, cash from operations, outside financing arrangements and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nExchanges of LP Units for shares of Class A common stock are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Summit Holdings. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of tax that Summit Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a TRA with the holders of LP Units that provides for the payment by Summit Inc. to exchanging holders of LP Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Summit Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. The increases in tax basis as a result of an exchange of LP Units for shares of Class A common stock, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, are difficult to accurately estimate as they will vary depending upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the timing of exchanges-for instance, the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair market value, which may fluctuate over time, of the depreciable or amortizable assets of Summit Holdings at the time of each exchange;\n\u2022the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange-the increase in any tax deductions, as well as the tax basis increase in other assets, of Summit Holdings, is directly proportional to the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange;\n\u2022the extent to which such exchanges are taxable-if an exchange is not taxable for any reason, increased deductions will not be available;\n\u2022the amount and timing of our income-Summit Inc. is required to pay 85% of the cash tax savings, if any, as and when realized. If Summit Inc. does not have taxable income, Summit Inc. is not required (absent a change of control or circumstances requiring an early termination payment) to make payments under the TRA for that taxable year because no cash tax savings will have been realized. However, any tax attributes that do not result in realized benefits in a given tax year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate benefits in previous or future tax years. The utilization of such tax attributes will result in cash tax savings that will result in payments under the tax receivable agreement; and\n\u2022the effective tax rate - The benefit that Summit Inc. realizes is dependent on the tax rate in effect at the time taxable income is generated.\nWe anticipate funding payments under the TRA from cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facilities. As of January 2, 2021, we had accrued $321.7 million as TRA liability. The entire TRA liability is a long term liability as no additional payments are expected in the next twelve months.\nIn addition, the TRA provides that upon certain changes of control, Summit Inc.'s (or its successor's) obligations would be based on certain assumptions, including that Summit Inc. would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from tax basis and other tax attributes subject to the TRA. With respect to our obligations under the TRA relating to previously exchanged or acquired LP Units and certain net operating losses, we would be required to make a payment equal to the present value (at a discount rate equal to one year LIBOR plus 100 basis points) of the anticipated future tax benefits determined using assumptions (ii) through (v) of the following paragraph.\nFurthermore, Summit Inc. may elect to terminate the TRA early by making an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future cash tax savings. In determining such anticipated future cash tax savings, the TRA includes several assumptions, including that (i) any LP Units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the shares of Class A common stock at the time of termination, (ii) Summit Inc. will have sufficient taxable income in each future taxable year to fully realize all potential tax savings, (iii) Summit Inc. will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize any remaining net operating losses subject to the TRA on a straight line basis over the shorter of the statutory expiration period for such net operating losses or the five-year period after the early termination or change of control, (iv) the tax rates for future years will be those specified in the law as in effect at the time of termination and (v) certain non-amortizable assets are deemed disposed of within specified time periods. In addition, the present value of such anticipated future cash tax savings are discounted at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points.\nAs a result of the change in control provisions and the early termination right, Summit Inc. could be required to make payments under the TRA that are greater than or less than the specified percentage of the actual cash tax savings that Summit Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA (although any such overpayment would be taken into account in calculating future payments, if any, under the TRA) or that are prior to the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. Also, the obligations of Summit Inc. would be automatically accelerated and be immediately due and payable in the event that Summit Inc. breaches any of its material obligations under the agreement and in certain events of bankruptcy or liquidation. In these situations, our obligations under the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity.\nUnder the terms of the TRA, we can terminate the TRA at any time, which would trigger a cash payment to the pre-IPO owners. Based upon a $20.08 per share price of our Class A common stock, the closing price of our stock on January 2, 2021 and a contractually defined discount rate of 1.34%, we estimate that if we were to exercise our right to terminate the TRA, the aggregate amount required to settle the TRA would be approximately $312 million.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents, as of January 2,

from actual results.\n(2)Future payments to fund our defined benefit plans are estimated based on multiple assumptions which are enumerated in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\n(3)Amounts represent purchase commitments entered into in the normal course of business, primarily for fuel purchases, the terms of which are generally one year.\n(4)The total amount payable under our TRA is estimated at $321.7 million as of January 2, 2021. Under the terms of the TRA, payment of amounts benefiting us is due to the pre-IPO owners within four months of the tax returns being submitted to the respective regulatory agencies when the benefits are realized. We are currently estimating benefits next being realized in the 2021 tax year, and paid to TRA holders in early 2023. The estimated timing of TRA payments is subject to a number of factors, primarily around the timing of the generation of future taxable income in future years, which will be impacted by business activity in those periods.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWe are party to certain legal actions arising from the ordinary course of business activities. Accruals are recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management expects that the ultimate resolution of all current pending or threatened claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We record legal fees as incurred.\nIn March 2018, we were notified of an investigation by the CCB into pricing practices by certain asphalt paving contractors in British Columbia, including Winvan. We believe the investigation is focused on time periods prior to our April 2017 acquisition of Winvan and we are cooperating with the CCB. Although we currently do not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the investigation at this time.\nEnvironmental Remediation and Site Restoration-Our operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and other regulatory matters. These operations require environmental operating permits, which are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. We regularly monitor and review its operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our business, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and noncompliance will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOther-We are obligated under various firm purchase commitments for certain raw materials and services that are in the ordinary course of business. Management does not expect any significant changes in the market value of these goods and services during the commitment period that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. The terms of the purchase commitments generally approximate one year.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 2, 2021, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\nWe evaluate our operating performance using metrics that we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA,\u201d Adjusted Cash Gross Profit\u201d and Adjusted Cash Gross Margin\u201d which are not defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted to exclude accretion, loss on debt financings, loss from discontinued operations and certain non-cash and non-operating items. We define Adjusted Cash Gross Profit as operating income before general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion and transaction costs and Adjusted Cash Gross Margin as Adjusted Cash Gross Profit as a percentage of net revenue.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Cash Gross Profit and Adjusted Cash Gross Margin for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyses. The investment community often uses these metrics to assess the operating performance of a company's business and to provide a consistent comparison of performance from period to period. We use these metrics, among others, to assess the operating performance of our individual segments and the consolidated company.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare such financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\nThe tables below reconcile our net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and present Adjusted EBITDA by segment and reconcile operating income to Adjusted Cash Gross Profit for the periods indicated:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.\nOn an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to the valuation of accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, pension and other postretirement obligations and asset retirement obligations. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAcquisitions-Purchase Price Allocation\nWe regularly review strategic long-term plans, including potential investments in value-added acquisitions of related or similar businesses, which would increase our market share and/or are related to our existing markets. When an acquisition is completed, our consolidated statement of operations includes the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition, which is the date that control is obtained. The purchase price is determined based on the estimated fair value of assets given to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions and the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized, can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and periods subsequent to a business combination.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction, and therefore represents an exit price. A fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants, considering the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible at the measurement date. We assign the highest level of fair value available to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the following options:\n\u2022Level 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n\u2022Level 2-Observable inputs, other than quoted prices, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u2022Level 3-Unobservable inputs, which includes the use of valuation models.\nLevel 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly-traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly-traded long-term debt.\nLevel 2 inputs are typically used to estimate the fair value of acquired machinery, equipment and land and assumed liabilities for asset retirement obligations, environmental remediation and compliance obligations and contingencies.\nLevel 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and leased mineral interests and other identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of mineral reserves and leased mineral interests are determined using an excess earnings approach, which require management to estimate future cash flows. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and forecasts determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price, volumes and expected profit margins, net of capital requirements. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business.\nThere is a measurement period after the acquisition date during which we may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination. Any such adjustments are based on us obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction. The measurement period ends once we have obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded in earnings.\nWe paid cash of $123.5 million and $5.4 million, net of cash acquired, in business combinations and allocated this amount to assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the years ended January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. The evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. The estimated future cash flows are derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry and markets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the affect such events might have on our reported values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe annual goodwill test is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is determined that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test, otherwise further analysis is not required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether we choose to perform the qualitative assessment or proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test.\nUnder the two-step quantitative impairment test, step one of the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We use a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) model to estimate the current fair value of our reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including macroeconomic trends in the reporting unit's geographic area impacting private construction and public infrastructure industries, the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future sales and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. We also perform a market assessment of our enterprise value. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in the valuations are reasonable.\nIn conjunction with our annual review of goodwill on the first day of the fourth quarter, we performed the qualitative assessment for our reporting units. In 2020, we performed a two-step quantitative analysis on four of our reporting units. Step 1 of that analysis compares the estimated the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach (i.e., a discounted cash flow technique) and a market approach to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value exceeds its\ncarrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we proceed to the second step to measure the amount of potential impairment loss.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we determined that no events or circumstances from September 28, 2020 through January 2, 2021 indicated that a further assessment was necessary.\nService Revenue Recognition\nWe earn revenue from the provision of services, which are primarily paving and related services, but also include landfill operations and the receipt and disposal of waste that is converted to fuel for use in our cement plants. Revenue from the receipt of waste fuels is recognized when the waste is accepted and a corresponding liability is recognized for the costs to process the waste into fuel for the manufacturing of cement or to ship the waste offsite for disposal in accordance with applicable regulations.\nCollectability of service contracts is due reasonably after certain milestones in the contract are performed. Milestones vary by project, but are typically calculated using monthly progress based on the percentage of completion or a customer's engineer review of progress. The majority of the time, collection occurs within 90 days of billing and cash is received within the same fiscal year as services performed. On most projects the customer will withhold a portion of the invoice for retainage which may last longer than a year depending on the job.\nRevenue derived from paving and related services is recognized using the percentage of completion method, which approximates progress towards completion. Under the percentage of completion method, we recognize paving and related services revenue as services are rendered. The majority of our construction service contracts are completed within one year, but may occasionally extend beyond this time frame. The majority of our construction service contracts, and therefore, revenue, are opened and completed within one year, with most activity during the spring, summer and fall. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on input measures. We generally measure progress toward completion on long-term paving and related services contracts based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. We include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the cumulative catch-up method, under which the effect of revisions in estimates is recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the period it is identified.\nThe percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over multiple periods, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the effect of delayed performance, and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. These estimates are based on our best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. We review our contract estimates regularly to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion. Inherent uncertainties in estimating costs make it at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change within the near term and over the life of the contracts. No material adjustments to a contract were recognized in the year ended January 2, 2021.\nWe recognize claims when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its legally enforceable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim.\nWhen the contract includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. The amount of estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price is the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Types of variable consideration include, but are not limited to, liquidated damages and other performance penalties and production and placement bonuses.\nThe majority of contract modifications relate to the original contract and are often an extension of the original performance obligation. Predominately, modifications are not distinct from the terms in the original contract; therefore, they are considered part of a single performance obligation. We account for the modification using a cumulative catch-up adjustment. However, there are instances where goods or services in a modification are distinct from those transferred prior to the\nmodification. In these situations, we account for the modifications as either a separate contract or prospectively depending on the facts and circumstances of the modification.\nGenerally, construction contracts contain mobilization costs which are categorized as costs to fulfill a contract. These costs are excluded from any measure of progress toward contract fulfillment. These costs do not result in the transfer of control of a good or service to the customer and are amortized over the life of the contract.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings are composed principally of revenue recognized on contracts on the percentage of completion method for which billings had not been presented to customers because the amounts were not billable under the contract terms at the balance sheet date. In accordance with the contract terms, the unbilled receivables at the balance sheet date are expected to be billed in following periods. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represent billings in excess of revenue recognized.\nIncome Taxes\nSummit Inc. is a corporation subject to income taxes in the United States. Certain subsidiaries, including Summit Holdings, or subsidiary groups of the Company are taxable separate from Summit Inc. The provisions for income taxes, or Summit Inc.'s proportional share of the provision, are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the tax basis and financial statement amounts that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, as well as consideration of tax-planning strategies to determine whether we may seek to utilize any net operating loss carryforwards scheduled to expire in the near future. The estimates of future taxable income involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. Our judgments regarding future taxable income and future cash flows are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, are consistent with our internal planning. The computed deferred balances are based on enacted tax laws and applicable rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such a determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If the Company determines it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had been recorded, then an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nThe Company evaluates the tax positions taken on income tax returns that remain open and positions expected to be taken on the current year tax returns to identify uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized is recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax benefit.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nTax Receivable Agreement- When Summit Inc. purchases LP Units for cash or LP Units are exchanged for shares of Class A common stock, this results in increases in Summit Inc.'s share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Summit Holdings, which increases the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to Summit Inc. These increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions are expected to reduce the amount of cash taxes that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. In connection with our IPO, we entered into a TRA with the holders of the LP Units and the pre-IPO owners that provides for the payment by Summit Inc. to exchanging holders of LP Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Summit Inc. actually realizes (or, under certain circumstances such as an early termination of the TRA is deemed to realize) as a result of (i) these increases in tax basis and (ii) our utilization of certain net operating losses of the pre-IPO owners and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA.\nWe periodically evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets resulting from the exchange of LP Units for Class A common stock. Our evaluation considers all sources of taxable income; all evidence, both positive and negative, is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all\nof the deferred tax assets. If the deferred tax assets are determined to be realizable, we then assess whether payment of amounts under the TRA have become probable. If so, we record a TRA liability of 85% of such deferred tax assets. In subsequent periods, we assess the realizability of all of our deferred tax assets subject to the TRA. Should we determine a deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance is realizable in a subsequent period, the related valuation allowance will be released and consideration of a corresponding TRA liability will be assessed. The realizability of deferred tax assets, including those subject to the TRA, is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those deferred tax assets become deductible and consideration of prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies.\nThe measurement of the TRA liability is accounted for as a contingent liability. Therefore, once we determine that a payment to a pre-IPO owner has become probable and can be estimated, the estimate of payment will be accrued.", "item_7_truncated": "Revenue from asphalt increased $8.1 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, organic pricing increased 1.4%, with strong pricing gains in the Kansas and North Texas geographies. Further, in 2020, we had strong volume increases in North Texas offset by decreases in Kentucky due to COVID-19 impacts.\nSince our inception in 2009, we have completed dozens of acquisitions, which are organized into 11 operating companies that make up our three distinct operating segments-West, East and Cement.

COVID-19 has since spread globally, including to every state in the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. As construction activities were deemed essential businesses in all of our markets, we continued to operate while many businesses were forced to close or reduce operations. During 2020, our operating markets remained substantially unaffected by COVID-19, except for Kentucky and to a lesser degree, Vancouver, British Columbia. However, we believe its impact may negatively affect our operations in subsequent periods if construction activity in future periods slows due to COVID-19. Residential construction activity remains strong, particularly in the Houston and Salt Lake City areas, two of the largest metro areas in which we operate. We believe residential activity in our key markets will continue to be a driver for volumes in future periods. While Kentucky had experienced fiscal shortfalls prior to COVID-19, those shortfalls were extended by COVID-19, and subsequently, Kentucky suspended lettings of department of transportation projects for May and June, and subsequent lettings have been significantly reduced from prior levels. In the Vancouver, British Columbia area, the provincial government has cancelled or delayed certain infrastructure projects. Our cement segment has also been impacted by lower sales demand, which we believe to be related to COVID-19, notably in our southern markets. In most of our other markets, we have not experienced any significant delays or cancellations of projects. Typically, state revenues decrease as the economy slows, and ultimately, some infrastructure projects may be delayed or cancelled, which would reduce our revenues in future periods. In 2020, approximately 61% of our revenue was derived from the private construction market, and the remaining revenue from the public markets. In addition to the volume impact on the cement segment, our annual cement price increases were delayed in 2020 from April 1 to June 1 due to COVID-19. We continue to monitor our operations, the operations of our customers, and the recommendations of the various national, state and local governments in the areas in which we operate. We implemented work-from-home protocols at all of our administrative locations late in the first quarter of 2020, and while some locations have returned, other locations, including our headquarters location, continue to work remotely. In addition, we implemented additional safety measures specific to COVID-19 at all of our operating locations, which did not significantly increase our costs. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the national and local economies in which we operate, and ultimately our business, will depend on numerous developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. These events, as they continue to develop, could result in business disruption, including reduced revenues, profitability and cash flow.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 29, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>by Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>West </td> <td> </td> <td>East </td> <td> </td> <td>Cement </td> <td> </td> <td>Corporate </td> <td> </td> <td>Consolidated </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(214,760) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,330 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense (income) (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>5,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,815) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116,548 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,747 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>91,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203,305 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(38,150) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415,930 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion </td> <td> </td> <td>570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,605 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt financings </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement benefit </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,684) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,684) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of business </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,108) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,238 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (2) </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,646) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,098) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,247) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>188,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(32,164) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>406,261 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Adjusted Cash Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Cash Gross Profit as a percentage of net revenue.\n\u2022According to the Texas Department of Transportation ( TXDOT\u201d), annual funding available for transportation infrastructure, including state and federal funding, is estimated to average $14.9 billion in total for fiscal year 2021 (which commenced September 1, 2020) and fiscal year 2022 combined. Further, the 2021 Unified Transportation Program ( UTP\u201d) approved by the Texas Transportation Commission in September 2020 provides for $75 billion through fiscal year 2030 to fund transportation projects; more than double the fiscal year 2016 level, which was prior to the Proposition 1 and Proposition 7 funding initiatives. The funding available in any given year is separate and distinct from lettings, or the process of providing notice, issuing proposals, receiving proposals, and awarding contracts. In January 2021, TXDOT updated its fiscal year 2021 lettings estimate to $9.6 billion up from $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2020 and $8.9 billion in fiscal year 2019. Longer term, TXDOT has indicated a target of $8 billion per year in total state and local lettings. The Texas Comptroller released its biennial revenue estimate for fiscal year 2022 - 2023 in January 2021 and expects economic output to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, and despite revenue shortfalls due to COVID-19 it is expected that the state highway fund will be granted its full allotment of $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2021 and 2022 from Proposition 7 funding.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>716,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>717,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,002) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>69,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,979) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin percentage </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,350) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(4)The total amount payable under our TRA is estimated at $321.7 million as of January 2, 2021.

We are currently estimating benefits next being realized in the 2021 tax year, and paid to TRA holders in early 2023.

includes labor, repair and maintenance, utilities, raw materials, fuel, transportation, subcontractor costs, and royalties. Our cost of revenue is directly affected by fluctuations in commodity energy prices, primarily diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. As a result, our adjusted cash gross profit margins can be significantly affected by changes in the underlying cost of certain raw materials if they are not recovered through corresponding changes in revenue. We attempt to limit our exposure to changes in commodity energy prices by entering into forward purchase commitments when appropriate. In addition, we have sales price adjustment provisions that provide for adjustments based on fluctuations outside a limited range in certain energy-related production costs. These provisions are in place for most of our public infrastructure contracts, and we seek to include similar price adjustment provisions in our private contracts.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 2, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 28, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Operating </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Operating </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Operating </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>income (loss) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,262,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,122,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,117,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,068 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East </td> <td> </td> <td>799,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>809,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>703,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,554 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cement </td> <td> </td> <td>270,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>290,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>280,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,843 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(76,486) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62,096) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(64,999) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,332,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,222,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,101,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,466 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet revenue in the East segment decreased $1.0 million in 2020 over 2019, as the decrease in asphalt and paving and services revenues exceeded the increase in aggregates and ready-mix concrete revenues.

We received $700.0 million from proceeds of debt issuance, which was offset by $33.3 million of payments on acquisition related liabilities and $674.0 million in debt payments, which includes $14.4 million of finance lease cash payments. Our future payments under our finance lease obligations are expected to decrease slightly from 2020 levels.\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. The evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. The estimated future cash flows are derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry and markets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the affect such events might have on our reported values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOther-We are obligated under various firm purchase commitments for certain raw materials and services that are in the ordinary course of business. Management does not expect any significant changes in the market value of these goods and services during the commitment period that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. The terms of the purchase commitments generally approximate one year.\nUse and consumption of our products fluctuate due to seasonality. Nearly all of the products used by us, and by our customers, in the private construction or public infrastructure industries are used outdoors. Our highway operations and production and distribution facilities are also located outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in particular extended rainy and cold weather in the spring and fall and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, heavy snows and flooding, can adversely affect our business and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year typically result in higher activity and revenue levels during those quarters. The first quarter of our fiscal year typically has lower levels of activity due to weather conditions.\nWe estimate that we will invest between $200 million and $220 million in capital expenditures in 2021, which includes $25 - $35 million for our greenfield development projects. The timing of our greenfield expenditures is dependent upon the timing of when permits may be issued. We expect to fund our capital expenditure program through cash on hand, cash from operations, outside financing arrangements and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nThe key components of our operating costs and expenses consist of the following:\nPrior to eliminations of intercompany transactions, the net effect of volume and pricing changes on gross revenue for the year ended January 2, 2021 was approximately $79.4 million and $26.7 million, respectively.\nSummit Inc. is a corporation subject to income taxes in the United States. Certain subsidiaries, including Summit Holdings, or subsidiary groups of the Company are taxable separate from Summit Inc. The provisions for income taxes, or Summit Inc.'s proportional share of the provision, are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nSummit LLC's wholly-owned domestic subsidiary companies, subject to certain exclusions and exceptions, are named as subsidiary guarantors of the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition, Summit LLC has pledged substantially all of its assets as collateral, subject to certain exclusions and exceptions, for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\n\nThe annual goodwill test is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is determined that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test, otherwise further analysis is not required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether we choose to perform the qualitative assessment or proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nDuring the year ended January 2, 2021, cash used for investing activities was $285.6 million, of which $123.5 million related to acquisitions completed in the period and $177.2 million was invested in capital expenditures, which was partially offset by $14.0 million of proceeds from asset sales.\n______________________\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.\n______________________\nLoss on Debt Financings\nOn March 15, 2019, the Issuers issued $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.500% senior notes due March 15, 2027. The 2027 Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value with proceeds of $296.3 million, net of related fees and expenses. Interest on the 2027 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year commencing on September 15, 2019.\n\n* Revenue by product includes intercompany and intracompany sales transferred at market value. The elimination of intracompany transactions is included in Other. Revenue from the liquid asphalt terminals is included in asphalt revenue.\nRevenue from aggregates in the East segment increased $4.4 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. Aggregate volumes in 2020 increased 3.5%, primarily due to organic growth in our Kansas markets from wind farm and other large non-residential project activity, offset by volume decreases in our Missouri and Kentucky markets. Our volumes decreased in Kentucky as the state continues to deal with lower tax revenues that preceded COVID-19, and those revenues further decreased after the onset of COVID-19. Aggregates pricing decreased 2.1% in 2020 due primarily to product mix in Missouri and Kentucky.\nThe percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over multiple periods, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the effect of delayed performance, and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. These estimates are based on our best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. We review our contract estimates regularly to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion. Inherent uncertainties in estimating costs make it at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change within the near term and over the life of the contracts. No material adjustments to a contract were recognized in the year ended January 2, 2021.\n\u2022Net revenue increased 5.1% or $104.1 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily resulting from organic growth and to a lesser extent, contributions from our acquisitions.\n______________________\nThe East segment's percent changes in sales volumes and pricing in 2020 as compared to 2019 were as follows:\nhistorically been a relatively stable portion of state and federal budgets. Residential and nonresidential construction consists of new construction and repair and remodel markets. Any economic stagnation or decline, which could vary by local region and market, could affect our results of operations. Our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical changes in construction spending, especially in the private sector. From a macroeconomic view, we see positive indicators for the construction sector, including positive trends in highway obligations, housing starts and construction employment.\nIncome Taxes\nCommitments and Contingencies\n\u2022the timing of exchanges-for instance, the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair market value, which may fluctuate over time, of the depreciable or amortizable assets of Summit Holdings at the time of each exchange;\n______________________\nFurthermore, Summit Inc. may elect to terminate the TRA early by making an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future cash tax savings. In determining such anticipated future cash tax savings, the TRA includes several assumptions, including that (i) any LP Units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the shares of Class A common stock at the time of termination, (ii) Summit Inc. will have sufficient taxable income in each future taxable year to fully realize all potential tax savings, (iii) Summit Inc. will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize any remaining net operating losses subject to the TRA on a straight line basis over the shorter of the statutory expiration period for such net operating losses or the five-year period after the early termination or change of control, (iv) the tax rates for future years will be those specified in the law as in effect at the time of termination and (v) certain non-amortizable assets are deemed disposed of within specified time periods. In addition, the present value of such anticipated future cash tax savings are discounted at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points.\n\nFinancial Highlights- Year ended January 2, 2021\n\u2022In December 2020, new Missouri legislation was submitted that calls for five consecutive years of a two-cent gas tax increase starting in January 2022, which would raise an incremental $100 million of revenue annually; Missouri currently has the second-lowest motor fuel tax in the United States at 17 cents per gallon. Despite the impact of COVID-19, the Missouri Department of Transportation had one of its strongest construction programs on record with payments to contractors of $821 million in calendar year-to-date November 2020 versus $662 million in the prior period and has now scheduled or is scheduled to let during the remainder of fiscal year 2021 (which commenced July 1, 2020) the entire $360 million of construction projects delayed in early 2020 as a result of COVID-19.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\u2022Billed and unbilled accounts receivable increased by $31.5 million in fiscal 2019 as a result of increased revenue from our acquisitions as compared to fiscal 2018.\n\u2022In December 2020, Utah updated its revenue estimate for transportation funding to $639 million in fiscal year 2021 (which commenced July 1, 2020) up from $614 million in fiscal year 2020, with growth driven by increases in vehicle registration fees, diesel fuel tax and other revenue sources. In January 2020, the Utah Department of Transportation increased fees on electric and hybrid vehicles by 50% in 2020 and another 33% in 2021 and launched an alternative to a road usage charge program for those vehicles in the form of a pay per mile charge. In December 2019, Utah passed new legislation imposing a 4.85% sales tax on gas purchases and a 6 cents per gallon increase to the diesel tax, with an additional 4 cents per gallon diesel tax increase in 2022. The tax is estimated to generate an additional $170 million for transportation investment in 2021.\nAccretion expense is the periodic expense recorded for the accrued mining reclamation liabilities and landfill closure and post-closure liabilities using the effective interest method.\nSegment Results of Operations\nOur Long-Term Debt\n\u2022the amount and timing of our income-Summit Inc. is required to pay 85% of the cash tax savings, if any, as and when realized. If Summit Inc. does not have taxable income, Summit Inc. is not required (absent a change of control or circumstances requiring an early termination payment) to make payments under the TRA for that taxable year because no cash tax savings will have been realized. However, any tax attributes that do not result in realized benefits in a given tax year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate benefits in previous or future tax years. The utilization of such tax attributes will result in cash tax savings that will result in payments under the tax receivable agreement; and\nSummit LLC has credit facilities that provide for term loans in an aggregate amount of $650 million and revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount of $345 million (the \"Senior Secured Credit Facilities\"). Under the terms of Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as amended through February 2019, required principal payments of 0.25% of the refinanced aggregate amount of term debt are due on the last business day of each March, June, September and December. The unpaid principal balance is due in full on the maturity date of November 21, 2024.\n______________________\nExchanges of LP Units for shares of Class A common stock are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Summit Holdings. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of tax that Summit Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a TRA with the holders of LP Units that provides for the payment by Summit Inc. to exchanging holders of LP Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Summit Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. The increases in tax basis as a result of an exchange of LP Units for shares of Class A common stock, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, are difficult to accurately estimate as they will vary depending upon a number of factors, including:\nOur business is capital intensive. We carry property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet at cost, net of applicable depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis or based on the economic usage over the estimated useful life of the asset. The general range of depreciable lives by category, excluding mineral reserves, which are depleted based on the units of production method on a site-by-site basis, is as follows:\nOur acquisition strategy has historically required us to raise capital through equity issuances or debt financings. As of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, our long-term borrowings totaled $1.9 billion, for which we incurred $91.2 million and $102.0 million of interest expense, respectively. Our senior secured revolving facility has been adequate to fund our\nFinancing Activities\nOperating margin percentage for the year ended January 2, 2021 decreased to 20.4% from 22.3% in the prior year, primarily due to the same factors noted above.\nOverview\n(d)Under the terms of our credit facilities, we include EBITDA from our acquisitions, net of dispositions, in each fiscal year for periods prior to acquisition. We believe this provides our lenders with a more meaningful view of our EBITDA across all periods by making the information more comparable.\nWhen the contract includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. The amount of estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price is the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Types of variable consideration include, but are not limited to, liquidated damages and other performance penalties and production and placement bonuses.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, cash used for investing activities was $162.8 million, of which $5.4 million related to acquisitions completed in the period and $177.5 million was invested in capital expenditures, which was partially offset by $21.2 million of proceeds from asset sales.\n______________________\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following discussion of our results of operations is focused on the key financial measures we use to evaluate the performance of our business from both a consolidated and operating segment perspective. Operating income and margins are discussed in terms of changes in volume, pricing and mix of revenue source (i.e., type of product sales or service revenue). We focus on operating margin, which we define as operating income as a percentage of net revenue, as a key metric when assessing the performance of the business, as we believe that analyzing changes in costs in relation to changes in revenue provides more meaningful insight into the results of operations than examining costs in isolation.\nAs a vertically-integrated company, we include intercompany sales from materials to products and from products to services when assessing the operating results of our business. We refer to revenue inclusive of intercompany sales as gross revenue. These intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Gross revenue by line of business was as follows:\nWe regularly review strategic long-term plans, including potential investments in value-added acquisitions of related or similar businesses, which would increase our market share and/or are related to our existing markets. When an acquisition is completed, our consolidated statement of operations includes the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition, which is the date that control is obtained. The purchase price is determined based on the estimated fair value of assets given to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions and the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized, can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and periods subsequent to a business combination.\nWe periodically evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets resulting from the exchange of LP Units for Class A common stock. Our evaluation considers all sources of taxable income; all evidence, both positive and negative, is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all\n\nThe Company evaluates the tax positions taken on income tax returns that remain open and positions expected to be taken on the current year tax returns to identify uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized is recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax benefit.\nWe expended approximately $177.2 million in capital expenditures for the year ended January 2, 2021 compared to $177.5 million and $220.7 million in the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nCash Paid for Capital Expenditures\nLevel 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly-traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly-traded long-term debt.\nGross revenue from aggregates in the West segment increased $38.9 million in 2020 over 2019, primarily due to an increase in sales volumes that more than offset a slight decrease in average sales price. Aggregates volumes increased in 2020 mainly in our Texas markets which had organic growth coupled with increased acquisition volumes, and increased organic volumes in our Intermountain markets. In 2020, organic aggregate volumes decreased in the Vancouver, British Columbia area due to COVID-19 related delays in projects. Aggregates pricing in 2020 decreased 0.8% when compared to 2019, due to product mix primarily in our Texas markets, resulting primarily from the impact of lower prices on acquisition related volumes.\nContractual Obligations\nGross revenue from asphalt in the West segment increased $31.2 million and asphalt volumes increased 10.3% in 2020, due to organic volume and price increases. Average sales prices for asphalt increased 2.9% in 2020. Gross revenue for paving and related services in the West segment increased by $76.4 million in 2020 due to greater activity in our North Texas markets, partially offset by our Intermountain geography and in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nPrior to eliminations of intercompany transactions, the net effect of volume and pricing changes on gross revenue for the year ended January 2, 2021 was approximately $6.9 million and $(1.3) million, respectively.\nWe are one of the fastest growing construction materials companies in the United States, with a 63% increase in revenue between the year ended January 2, 2016 (the year of our initial public offering) and the year ended January 2, 2021. Within our markets, we offer customers a single-source provider for construction materials and related downstream products through our vertical integration. Our materials include aggregates, which we supply across the United States, and in British Columbia, Canada, and cement, which we supply to surrounding states along the Mississippi River from Minnesota to Louisiana. In addition to supplying aggregates to customers, we use a portion of our materials internally to produce ready-mix concrete and asphalt paving mix, which may be sold externally or used in our paving and related services businesses. Our vertical integration creates opportunities to increase aggregates volumes, optimize margin at each stage of production and provide customers with efficiency gains, convenience and reliability, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage.\nRevenue from ready-mix concrete in the East segment increased $24.3 million in 2020, as we realized higher organic volumes and pricing in all of our markets except Virginia. In 2020, ready-mix concrete volumes increased 11.2%, and average sales prices increased 4.6%.\n\n\n\u2022Net income of $61.1 million, adjusted for $249.7 million of non-cash expenses, including $222.9 million of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, $20.4 million of share-based compensation and $16.0 million of change in deferred tax asset, net.\n(2)Pricing is shown on a per ton basis for aggregates, cement and asphalt and on a per cubic yard basis for ready-mix concrete.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings are composed principally of revenue recognized on contracts on the percentage of completion method for which billings had not been presented to customers because the amounts were not billable under the contract terms at the balance sheet date. In accordance with the contract terms, the unbilled receivables at the balance sheet date are expected to be billed in following periods. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represent billings in excess of revenue recognized.\n\u2022Level 3-Unobservable inputs, which includes the use of valuation models.\n\u2022In January 2021, the Governor of Kansas submitted a revised budget for fiscal year 2021 (which commenced July 1, 2020) and an initial budget recommendation for fiscal year 2022 with $1.9 billion in transportation funding budgeted in 2021 and $2.2 billion for 2022. Transfers from the State Highway Fund ( SHF\u201d) to the State General Fund ( SGF\u201d) are expected to be eliminated by fiscal year 2023 with $134 million currently estimated to be transferred to the SGF in fiscal year 2021 and $67 million in fiscal year 2022. The elimination of transfers out of the SHF is expected to help pave the way for the issuance of new transportation bonds and keep funds available to continue moving forward the 10-year, $10 billion Eisenhower Legacy Plan that was approved by the Kansas Legislature in early 2020. The Eisenhower Legacy Plan selects new modernization and expansion projects every two years, requires previously selected projects under the prior T-Works program to be let prior to July 1, 2023 and levies 16.2% of the state sales tax for the benefit of the SHF.\nTax Receivable Agreement (Benefit) Expense\nWe anticipate funding payments under the TRA from cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facilities. As of January 2, 2021, we had accrued $321.7 million as TRA liability. The entire TRA liability is a long term liability as no additional payments are expected in the next twelve months.\nInvesting Activities\n(2)Source: 2019 PCA\nDetail of our volumes and average selling prices by product for the years ended January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019 were as follows:\n______________________\n\u2022Billed and unbilled accounts receivable decreased by $10.0 million in fiscal 2020 as a result of the seasonality of our business. The majority of our sales occur in the spring, summer and fall and we typically incur an increase in accounts receivable (net billed and unbilled) during the second and third quarters of each year. This amount is typically converted to cash in the fourth and first quarters.\nRevenue from cement decreased $8.5 million in 2020, as volume decreases of 4.6% were only partially offset by small organic cement pricing gains. We have historically implemented cement pricing increases in April each year; however, in 2020, those increases were deferred until June 1 as a result of COVID-19. We believe the decreases in volume are the result of COVID-19, primarily in southern markets, where the demand for cement is partially driven by the energy industry.\nWe derive our revenue predominantly by selling construction materials and products and providing paving and related services. Construction materials consist of aggregates and cement. Products consist of related downstream products, including ready-mix concrete, asphalt paving mix and concrete products. Paving and related services that we provide are primarily asphalt paving services.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nOn August 11, 2020, Summit LLC and Summit Finance (together, the Issuers\u201d) issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due January 15, 2029. The 2029 Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value with proceeds of $690.4 million, net of related fees and expenses. Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year commencing on January 15, 2021.\nThe U.S. construction materials industry is composed of four primary sectors: aggregates; cement; ready-mix concrete; and asphalt paving mix. Each of these materials is widely used in most forms of construction activity. Participants in these sectors typically range from small, privately-held companies focused on a single material, product or market to publicly traded multinational corporations that offer a wide array of construction materials and services. Competition is constrained in part by the distance materials can be transported efficiently, resulting in predominantly local or regional operations. Due to the lack of product differentiation, competition for all of our products is predominantly based on price and, to a lesser extent, quality of products and service. As a result, the prices we charge our customers are not likely to be materially different from the prices charged by other producers in the same markets. Accordingly, our profitability is generally dependent on the level of demand for our materials and products and our ability to control operating costs.\n______________________\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTax Receivable Agreement\ncarrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we proceed to the second step to measure the amount of potential impairment loss.\nNet revenue in the Cement segment decreased $20.1 million in 2020 over 2019, primarily due to decreased organic cement volumes of 4.6%. In addition, an explosion in April 2020 that shut down our solid waste processing facility contributed to the revenue decline in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nThere were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of January 2, 2021 or December 28, 2019. As of January 2, 2021, we had remaining borrowing capacity of $329.1 million under the revolving credit facility, which is net of $15.9 million of outstanding letters of credit. The outstanding letters of credit are renewed annually and support required bonding on construction projects and the Company's insurance liabilities.\n_____________________\nThe majority of contract modifications relate to the original contract and are often an extension of the original performance obligation. Predominately, modifications are not distinct from the terms in the original contract; therefore, they are considered part of a single performance obligation. We account for the modification using a cumulative catch-up adjustment. However, there are instances where goods or services in a modification are distinct from those transferred prior to the\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $8.2 million. We received $19.1 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and $300.0 million from proceeds of debt issuance, which was offset by $33.9 million of payments on acquisition related liabilities and $270.2 million in debt payments.\nIn March 2018, we were notified of an investigation by the CCB into pricing practices by certain asphalt paving contractors in British Columbia, including Winvan. We believe the investigation is focused on time periods prior to our April 2017 acquisition of Winvan and we are cooperating with the CCB. Although we currently do not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the investigation at this time.\nOther Financial Information\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Cash Gross Profit and Adjusted Cash Gross Margin for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyses. The investment community often uses these metrics to assess the operating performance of a company's business and to provide a consistent comparison of performance from period to period. We use these metrics, among others, to assess the operating performance of our individual segments and the consolidated company.\n\u2022Our operating income increased 5.4% or $11.6 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, as pricing and volume increases exceeded the increases in cost of revenue.\nCement Segment\n\n\u2022the extent to which such exchanges are taxable-if an exchange is not taxable for any reason, increased deductions will not be available;\nThe tables below reconcile our net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and present Adjusted EBITDA by segment and reconcile operating income to Adjusted Cash Gross Profit for the periods indicated:\nTotal Revenue\nRevenue from ready-mix concrete increased $60.3 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, our ready-mix volumes increased 5.0% and our average sales prices increased 4.7%. These volume and price increases in 2020 occurred in both the West and East segments. Volumes in the Intermountain, Texas and Kansas geographies were impacted by more favorable weather conditions during 2020 as compared to 2019.\nRevenue derived from paving and related services is recognized using the percentage of completion method, which approximates progress towards completion. Under the percentage of completion method, we recognize paving and related services revenue as services are rendered. The majority of our construction service contracts are completed within one year, but may occasionally extend beyond this time frame. The majority of our construction service contracts, and therefore, revenue, are opened and completed within one year, with most activity during the spring, summer and fall. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on input measures. We generally measure progress toward completion on long-term paving and related services contracts based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. We include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the cumulative catch-up method, under which the effect of revisions in estimates is recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the period it is identified.\nOur general and administrative expenses in 2020 increased $32.2 million over 2019, due primarily to increased incentive compensation expenses, and expenses recognized in connection with the transition of our chief executive officer. Our stock based compensation expense increased $8.5 million over 2019, primarily due to additional equity grants related to the transition of our chief executive officer.\nFor the years ended January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, our Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio was 0.51 to 1.00 and 0.80 to 1.00, respectively, based on consolidated first lien net debt of $254.5 million and $369.4 million as of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively, divided by Further Adjusted EBITDA of $496.5 million and $461.5 million for the years ended January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively. As of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition.

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data,\u201d our audited consolidated annual financial statements and the related notes thereto and other information included in this report. A discussion and analysis of our results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 may be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 5, 2020, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare such financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\n(2)For the year ended December 28, 2019, we negotiated a $2.0 million reduction in the amount of a contingent liability from one of our acquisitions. For the year ended December 29, 2018, we negotiated a $6.9 million reduction in the amount of a contingent liability from one of our acquisitions. As we had passed the period to revise the opening balance sheet for this acquisition, the adjustment was recorded as other income.\nThe West segment's percent changes in sales volumes and pricing comparing 2020 to 2019 were as follows:\nOur revenue is derived from multiple end-use markets including public infrastructure construction and private residential and nonresidential construction. Public infrastructure includes spending by federal, state, provincial and local governments for roads, highways, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. Public infrastructure projects have\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash on-hand, cash provided by our operations and amounts available for borrowing under our credit facilities and capital-raising activities in the debt capital markets. In addition to our current sources of liquidity, we have access to liquidity through public offerings of shares of our Class A common stock. To facilitate such offerings, in January 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that is effective for a term of three years and will expire in January 2023. The amount of Class A common stock to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific limit on the amount we may issue. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of the proceeds thereof, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.\n\n(1)Percentages based on our revenue by state for the year ended January 2, 2021 and management's estimates as to end markets.\n* Revenue from waste processing and the elimination of intracompany transactions are included in Other.\nIn August 2020, we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2029 Notes to redeem all of the outstanding 2023 Notes. In connection with that transaction, charges of $4.1 million were recognized in fiscal 2020. The charges included $0.8 million for the write-off of unamortized original issue discount and $3.3 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees.\n(a)Represents the transaction expenses associated with closed and probable acquisitions, consisting primarily of accounting, legal, valuation and financial advisory fees for the acquisitions.\n\nWe believe we have access to sufficient financial resources from our liquidity sources to fund our business and operations, including contractual obligations, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, for at least the next twelve months. Our growth strategy contemplates future acquisitions for which we believe we have sufficient access to capital.\nOur income tax benefit was $12.2 million for the year ended January 2, 2021 as compared to income tax expense of $17.1 million for the year ended December 28, 2019. Our effective tax rate for Summit Inc. differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to (1) unrecognized tax benefits, (2) changes in the valuation allowance, (3) state taxes, (4) tax depletion expense in excess of the expense recorded under U.S. GAAP, (5) the minority interest in the Summit Holdings partnership that is allocated outside of the Company and (6) various other items such as limitations on meals and entertainment, certain stock compensation and other costs. The Company's income tax provision is calculated under the provisions of the final regulations related to tax reform legislation, which may limit our ability to deduct interest expense in calculating our taxable income. All adjustments resulting from the issuance of the final regulations have been recorded.\nGross revenue from ready-mix concrete in the West segment increased $36.0 million in 2020 over 2019. For the year ended January 2, 2021, organic ready-mix concrete prices increased 4.7%. For the year ended January 2, 2021, our ready-mix concrete organic volumes increased 3.0%, as volume increases in the Intermountain geographies were offset by volume decreases in North Texas. We continue to see strong residential volumes in the Salt Lake City and Houston areas, while volumes in the Permian basin area have decreased due to an economic slowdown in that area.\nRevenue from cement decreased $8.5 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, organic cement volumes decreased 4.6% and organic cement average sales prices increased 1.5%, respectively, as compared to 2019.\nseasonal working capital needs and certain acquisitions. We had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility as of January 2, 2021.\nGenerally, construction contracts contain mobilization costs which are categorized as costs to fulfill a contract. These costs are excluded from any measure of progress toward contract fulfillment. These costs do not result in the transfer of control of a good or service to the customer and are amortized over the life of the contract.\n\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, below.\n______________________\nThe table below includes revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated. Operating income (loss) by segment is computed as earnings before interest, loss on debt financings, tax receivable agreement expense, gain on sale of business, other income / expense and taxes.\n(2)Future payments to fund our defined benefit plans are estimated based on multiple assumptions which are enumerated in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nService Revenue Recognition\nIn addition, the TRA provides that upon certain changes of control, Summit Inc.'s (or its successor's) obligations would be based on certain assumptions, including that Summit Inc. would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from tax basis and other tax attributes subject to the TRA. With respect to our obligations under the TRA relating to previously exchanged or acquired LP Units and certain net operating losses, we would be required to make a payment equal to the present value (at a discount rate equal to one year LIBOR plus 100 basis points) of the anticipated future tax benefits determined using assumptions (ii) through (v) of the following paragraph.\nAcquisitions-Purchase Price Allocation\n\ninternational producers as we did in 2019. As such, our overall operating costs increased in 2020 over 2019. We believe our lower sales volumes are related to COVID-19, notably in our southern markets. Additionally, our solid waste processing facility that provides fuel for one of our plants remained closed to processing solid waste due to an explosion in April 2020, which also increased our operating costs. We expect to receive the necessary approvals to reopen that facility sometime late in the first quarter 2021.\nGoodwill\nOperating income (loss) reflects our profit after taking into consideration cost of revenue, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion and gain on sale of property, plant and equipment. Cost of revenue generally increases ratably with revenue, as labor, transportation costs and subcontractor costs are recorded in cost of revenue. In periods where our revenue growth occurs primarily through acquisitions, general and administrative expenses and depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion have historically grown ratably with revenue. However, as organic volumes increase, we expect these costs, as a percentage of revenue, to decrease. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue vary throughout the year due to the seasonality of our business.\nIn March 2019, we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 6.500% senior notes due March 15, 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\") to redeem all of the outstanding 8.500% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d). In connection with this transaction, charges of $14.6 million were recognized in fiscal 2019. The charges included $11.7 million for the applicable prepayment premium and $2.9 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees.\n* Revenue by product includes intercompany and intracompany sales transferred at market value. The elimination of intracompany transactions is included in Other. Revenue from the liquid asphalt terminals is included in asphalt revenue.\nThe principal factors in evaluating our financial condition and operating results for the year ended January 2, 2021 are:\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nOur TRA benefit for the year ended January 2, 2021 was $7.6 million as compared to TRA expense of $16.2 million in the year ended December 28, 2019. Each year, we update our estimate as to when TRA payments will be made. When payments are made under the TRA, a portion of the payment made will be characterized as imputed interest under IRS regulations. We also updated our estimate of the state income tax rate that will be in effect at the date the TRA payments are made. As a result of updated state income tax rate, and the imputed interest limitation noted above, we decreased our TRA liability by $7.6 million as of January 2, 2021 and increased our TRA liability by $16.2 million as of December 28, 2019.\nof the deferred tax assets. If the deferred tax assets are determined to be realizable, we then assess whether payment of amounts under the TRA have become probable. If so, we record a TRA liability of 85% of such deferred tax assets. In subsequent periods, we assess the realizability of all of our deferred tax assets subject to the TRA. Should we determine a deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance is realizable in a subsequent period, the related valuation allowance will be released and consideration of a corresponding TRA liability will be assessed. The realizability of deferred tax assets, including those subject to the TRA, is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those deferred tax assets become deductible and consideration of prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs, including stock-based compensation charges, for our sales and marketing, administration, finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and certain managerial employees. Additional expenses include audit, consulting and professional fees, travel, insurance, rental costs, property taxes and other corporate and overhead expenses.\nWe evaluate our operating performance using metrics that we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA,\u201d Adjusted Cash Gross Profit\u201d and Adjusted Cash Gross Margin\u201d which are not defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted to exclude accretion, loss on debt financings, loss from discontinued operations and certain non-cash and non-operating items. We define Adjusted Cash Gross Profit as operating income before general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion and transaction costs and Adjusted Cash Gross Margin as Adjusted Cash Gross Profit as a percentage of net revenue.\nIn conjunction with our annual review of goodwill on the first day of the fourth quarter, we performed the qualitative assessment for our reporting units. In 2020, we performed a two-step quantitative analysis on four of our reporting units. Step 1 of that analysis compares the estimated the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach (i.e., a discounted cash flow technique) and a market approach to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value exceeds its\n\u2022The timing of payments associated with accounts payable and accrued expenses of cash, which is consistent with the seasonality of our business whereby we build-up inventory levels and incur repairs and maintenance costs to ready the business for increased sales volumes in the summer and fall. These costs are typically incurred in the first half of the year and paid by year-end. In addition, we made $99.6 million of interest payments in 2020. Our cash interest payments are expected to decrease slightly from this amount in 2021 and beyond.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\n______________________\nComponents of Operating Results\n(1)The reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is based on the financial results of Summit Inc. and its subsidiaries, which was $20.5 million greater, $27.5 million less and 27.5 million less than Summit LLC and its subsidiaries in the years ended January 2, 2021, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, due to interest expense associated with a deferred consideration obligation, TRA expense and income tax benefit are obligations of Summit Holdings and Summit Inc., respectively, and are thus excluded from Summit LLC's consolidated net income.\nWe earn revenue from the provision of services, which are primarily paving and related services, but also include landfill operations and the receipt and disposal of waste that is converted to fuel for use in our cement plants. Revenue from the receipt of waste fuels is recognized when the waste is accepted and a corresponding liability is recognized for the costs to process the waste into fuel for the manufacturing of cement or to ship the waste offsite for disposal in accordance with applicable regulations.\nNet revenue increased $104.1 million in the year ended January 2, 2021, primarily resulting from organic growth in our aggregates and ready-mix concrete operations. Of the increase in net revenue, $80.5 million was from increased sales of products, $19.7 million from increased sales of materials and $3.9 million from increased service revenue. We generated organic volume growth of 3.6%, 5.0% and 4.7% in aggregates, ready-mix concrete and asphalt, respectively, during 2020 over the prior year period, while our organic cement volumes declined 4.6% compared to 2019. We had organic price growth in our cement, ready-mix and asphalt lines of business of 1.5%, 4.7% and 1.4%, respectively, during 2020. Operating income increased by $11.6 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily as net revenue gains exceeded increases in costs of revenue and general and administrative expenses.\n* Revenue by product includes intercompany and intracompany sales transferred at market value. The elimination of intracompany transactions is included in Other. Revenue from the liquid asphalt terminals is included in asphalt revenue.\nOperating income in the East segment decreased $32.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $25.4 million in 2020 over 2019, primarily due to lower margins on our asphalt and paving business, which resulted from decreased activity in Kentucky. In addition, our organic sales prices decreased in Missouri as 2019 included more higher priced flood and levy volumes. Further, our Kentucky operations worked to sell lower priced inventory to generate cash flow. Operating margin percentage in 2020 decreased to 9.7% from 14.2% in 2019, due to the items noted above.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we had $418.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $570.6 million of working capital as compared to $311.3 million and $497.0 million, respectively, at December 28, 2019. Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. There were no restricted cash balances as of January 2, 2021 or December 28, 2019.\nThere is a measurement period after the acquisition date during which we may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination. Any such adjustments are based on us obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction. The measurement period ends once we have obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded in earnings.\nGiven the seasonality of our business, we typically experience significant fluctuations in working capital needs and balances throughout the year. Our working capital requirements generally increase during the first half of the year as we build up inventory and focus on repair and maintenance and other set-up costs for the upcoming season. Working capital levels then decrease as the construction season winds down and we enter the winter months, which is when we see significant inflows of cash from the collection of receivables.\nUnder the two-step quantitative impairment test, step one of the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We use a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) model to estimate the current fair value of our reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including macroeconomic trends in the reporting unit's geographic area impacting private construction and public infrastructure industries, the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future sales and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. We also perform a market assessment of our enterprise value. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in the valuations are reasonable.\n(1) Corporate results primarily consist of compensation and office expenses for employees included in the Company's headquarters.\nEast Segment\nOur remaining borrowing capacity on our $345.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility as of January 2, 2021 was $329.1 million, which is net of $15.9 million of outstanding letters of credit, and is fully available to us within the terms and covenant requirements of our credit agreement.\nUnder the terms of the TRA, we can terminate the TRA at any time, which would trigger a cash payment to the pre-IPO owners. Based upon a $20.08 per share price of our Class A common stock, the closing price of our stock on January 2, 2021 and a contractually defined discount rate of 1.34%, we estimate that if we were to exercise our right to terminate the TRA, the aggregate amount required to settle the TRA would be approximately $312 million.\nAs market conditions warrant we may, from time to time, seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including Senior Notes and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities. Such transactions could be privately negotiated, open market transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may equate to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, which may reduce the trading liquidity of such class or series.\nThe table below sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:\nThe Company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the tax basis and financial statement amounts that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, as well as consideration of tax-planning strategies to determine whether we may seek to utilize any net operating loss carryforwards scheduled to expire in the near future. The estimates of future taxable income involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. Our judgments regarding future taxable income and future cash flows are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, are consistent with our internal planning. The computed deferred balances are based on enacted tax laws and applicable rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such a determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If the Company determines it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had been recorded, then an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n(1)Future interest payments were calculated using the applicable fixed and floating rates charged by our lenders in effect as of January 2, 2021 and may differ from actual results.\nCollectability of service contracts is due reasonably after certain milestones in the contract are performed. Milestones vary by project, but are typically calculated using monthly progress based on the percentage of completion or a customer's engineer review of progress. The majority of the time, collection occurs within 90 days of billing and cash is received within the same fiscal year as services performed. On most projects the customer will withhold a portion of the invoice for retainage which may last longer than a year depending on the job.\nGross revenue by product/service was as follows:\n\u2022The timing of payments associated with accounts payable and accrued expenses of cash, which is consistent with the seasonality of our business whereby we build-up inventory levels and incur repairs and maintenance costs to ready the business for increased sales volumes in the summer and fall. These costs are typically incurred in the first half of the year and paid by year-end. In addition, we made $104.6 million of interest payments in 2019.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to 2019\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\n\nmodification. In these situations, we account for the modifications as either a separate contract or prospectively depending on the facts and circumstances of the modification.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nResults of Operations\nTax Receivable Agreement- When Summit Inc. purchases LP Units for cash or LP Units are exchanged for shares of Class A common stock, this results in increases in Summit Inc.'s share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Summit Holdings, which increases the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to Summit Inc. These increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions are expected to reduce the amount of cash taxes that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. In connection with our IPO, we entered into a TRA with the holders of the LP Units and the pre-IPO owners that provides for the payment by Summit Inc. to exchanging holders of LP Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Summit Inc. actually realizes (or, under certain circumstances such as an early termination of the TRA is deemed to realize) as a result of (i) these increases in tax basis and (ii) our utilization of certain net operating losses of the pre-IPO owners and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA.\n\u2022Level 2-Observable inputs, other than quoted prices, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.\nThe Cement segment's operating income decreased $9.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $10.5 million in 2020. Although our sales volumes decreased, our production volumes increased as we did not purchase as much cement from\nBusiness Trends and Conditions\n\nRevenue from aggregates increased $43.2 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, increases in our northern Texas and Virginia markets were partially offset by organic aggregate volumes declines in Missouri as flood repair work in 2020 was less than in 2019 and Kentucky due to COVID-19 impacts. Overall, our average sales price in 2020 decreased over 2019 primarily as the product mix shifted away from higher priced flood repair products to lower priced products and the impact of lower priced acquisition related sales volumes in Texas. For the year ended January 2, 2021, our aggregate volumes increased primarily due to acquisition volumes, and to a lesser extent, due to increased organic volumes. Aggregate volumes growth was attributable to organic growth in both the West and East segments. Organic aggregate volumes increased 3.6% in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in our North Texas, Intermountain West and Kansas markets. Aggregate average sales prices of $10.77 per ton decreased 2.0% in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower priced products in our Missouri markets and acquisition related volumes noted above.\n______________________\nTransportation infrastructure projects, driven by both federal and state funding programs, represent a significant share of the U.S. construction materials market. Federal funds are allocated to the states, which are required to match a portion of the federal funds they receive. Federal highway spending uses funds predominantly from the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which derives its revenue from taxes on diesel fuel, gasoline and other user fees. The dependability of federal funding allows the state departments of transportation to plan for their long term highway construction and maintenance needs. Funding for the existing federal transportation funding program was extended in late 2020 through 2021. With the nation's infrastructure aging, there is increased demand by states and municipalities for long-term federal funding to support the construction of new roads, highways and bridges in addition to the maintenance of the existing infrastructure.\n\u2022the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange-the increase in any tax deductions, as well as the tax basis increase in other assets, of Summit Holdings, is directly proportional to the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange;\n______________________\nLevel 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and leased mineral interests and other identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of mineral reserves and leased mineral interests are determined using an excess earnings approach, which require management to estimate future cash flows. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and forecasts determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price, volumes and expected profit margins, net of capital requirements. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business.\n\nWest Segment\n\u2022In August 2020, we issued $700.0 million of 5.250% senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes\u201d), resulting in net proceeds of $690.4 million, after related fees and expenses. The proceeds from the 2029 Notes were used to redeem the $650.0 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d) at par.\n(b)Represents non-cash equity-based compensation granted to employees.\nThe revolving credit facility bears interest per annum equal to, at Summit LLC's option, either (i) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus an applicable margin of 2.00% for base rate loans or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to\n(c)Represents the net (gain) loss recognized on assets identified for disposal.

Among other things, we are required to maintain a Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio that is no greater than 4.75 to 1.00. Our first lien net leverage ratio, for purposes of this maintenance requirement, is calculated following each quarter based on information for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial information is available by dividing our Consolidated First Lien Net Debt as of the end of such period by our Consolidated EBITDA for such period. Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of our senior secured credit facility is calculated in accordance with our presentation of Further Adjusted EBITDA below. We define Further Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA plus the EBITDA contribution of certain recent acquisitions.\nIn March 2019, using the proceeds from the 2027 Notes, all of the 2022 Notes were redeemed at a price equal to par plus an applicable premium and the indenture under which the 2022 Notes were issued was satisfied and discharged. As a result of the extinguishment, charges of $14.6 million were recognized in the quarter ended March 30, 2019, which included charges of $11.7 million for the applicable redemption premium and $2.9 million for the write-off of deferred financing fees.\nGross revenue by product/service was as follows:\nReuters prior to the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs plus an applicable margin of 3.00% for LIBOR rate loans.\nAt January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, $1.9 billion of total debt was outstanding under our respective debt agreements. Summit LLC's senior secured credit facilities provide for term loans in an aggregate amount of $650.0 million and revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount of $345.0 million (the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). Summit LLC's domestic wholly-owned subsidiary companies are named as guarantors of the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Certain other partially-owned subsidiaries, and the wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, Mainland, do not guarantee the Senior Notes or Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Summit LLC has pledged substantially all of its assets as collateral for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nEnvironmental Remediation and Site Restoration-Our operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and other regulatory matters. These operations require environmental operating permits, which are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. We regularly monitor and review its operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our business, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and noncompliance will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nGross revenue by product was as follows:\n\u2022Level 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWe are subject to commodity price risk with respect to price changes in liquid asphalt and energy, including fossil fuels and electricity for aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete and asphalt paving mix production, natural gas for hot mix asphalt production and diesel fuel for distribution vehicles and production related mobile equipment. Liquid asphalt escalator provisions in most of our private and commercial contracts limit our exposure to price fluctuations in this commodity. We often obtain similar escalators on public infrastructure contracts. In addition, we enter into various firm purchase commitments, with terms generally less than one year, for certain raw materials.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we determined that no events or circumstances from September 28, 2020 through January 2, 2021 indicated that a further assessment was necessary.\nDuring the year ended January 2, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $408.9 million primarily as a result of:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure below.\nFor the year ended January 2, 2021, our operating margin percentage remained flat as compared to the year ended December 28, 2019, due to the items noted above. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, increased by $23.6 million in the year ended January 2, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 28, 2019.\nCash Flows\nRevenue derived from paving and related services is recognized on the percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the cost incurred to date compared to estimated total cost of each project. This method is used because management considers cost incurred to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change over the life of the contract.\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, below.\n\nThe measurement of the TRA liability is accounted for as a contingent liability. Therefore, once we determine that a payment to a pre-IPO owner has become probable and can be estimated, the estimate of payment will be accrued.\nSenior Notes\nIn August 2020, using the proceeds from the 2029 Notes, all of the outstanding $650.0 million 6.125% senior notes due 2023 were redeemed at a price equal to par and the indenture under which the 2023 Notes were issued was satisfied and discharged. As a result of the extinguishment, charges of $4.1 million were recognized in the quarter ended September 26, 2020, which included charges of $0.8 million for the write-off of original issue discount and $3.3 million for the write-off of deferred financing fees.\n(1)The statement of operations above is based on the financial results of Summit Inc. and its subsidiaries, which was $20.5 million greater, $27.5 million less and $27.5 million less than Summit LLC and its subsidiaries in the years ended January 2, 2021, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, due to interest expense associated with a deferred consideration obligation, TRA expense and income tax benefit are obligations of Summit Holdings and Summit Inc., respectively and are thus excluded from Summit LLC's consolidated net income.\nCost of Revenue (excluding items shown separately)\n\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA are not U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nOn February 28, 2019, Summit LLC entered into Incremental Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, increased the total amount available under the revolving credit facility to $345.0 million and extended the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to February 2024.\nNet revenue in the West segment increased $125.2 million in the year ended January 2, 2021, due to increases in net revenues in all lines of business. Organic aggregate volumes increased 4.4% in 2020 as compared to 2019, and organic aggregates average sales prices increased 1.8%, primarily due to product mix. Organic ready-mix concrete volumes increased 3.0% and our organic ready-mix concrete average sales prices increased 4.7%.\nWe are party to certain legal actions arising from the ordinary course of business activities. Accruals are recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management expects that the ultimate resolution of all current pending or threatened claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We record legal fees as incurred.", "item_7_text": "Revenue from asphalt increased $8.1 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, organic pricing increased 1.4%, with strong pricing gains in the Kansas and North Texas geographies. Further, in 2020, we had strong volume increases in North Texas offset by decreases in Kentucky due to COVID-19 impacts.\nSince our inception in 2009, we have completed dozens of acquisitions, which are organized into 11 operating companies that make up our three distinct operating segments-West, East and Cement. We operate in 21 U.S. states and in British Columbia, Canada and currently have assets in 23 U.S. states and British Columbia, Canada. The map below illustrates our geographic footprint:\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") virus was first reported to have surfaced. COVID-19 has since spread globally, including to every state in the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. As construction activities were deemed essential businesses in all of our markets, we continued to operate while many businesses were forced to close or reduce operations. During 2020, our operating markets remained substantially unaffected by COVID-19, except for Kentucky and to a lesser degree, Vancouver, British Columbia. However, we believe its impact may negatively affect our operations in subsequent periods if construction activity in future periods slows due to COVID-19. Residential construction activity remains strong, particularly in the Houston and Salt Lake City areas, two of the largest metro areas in which we operate. We believe residential activity in our key markets will continue to be a driver for volumes in future periods. While Kentucky had experienced fiscal shortfalls prior to COVID-19, those shortfalls were extended by COVID-19, and subsequently, Kentucky suspended lettings of department of transportation projects for May and June, and subsequent lettings have been significantly reduced from prior levels. In the Vancouver, British Columbia area, the provincial government has cancelled or delayed certain infrastructure projects. Our cement segment has also been impacted by lower sales demand, which we believe to be related to COVID-19, notably in our southern markets. In most of our other markets, we have not experienced any significant delays or cancellations of projects. Typically, state revenues decrease as the economy slows, and ultimately, some infrastructure projects may be delayed or cancelled, which would reduce our revenues in future periods. In 2020, approximately 61% of our revenue was derived from the private construction market, and the remaining revenue from the public markets. In addition to the volume impact on the cement segment, our annual cement price increases were delayed in 2020 from April 1 to June 1 due to COVID-19. We continue to monitor our operations, the operations of our customers, and the recommendations of the various national, state and local governments in the areas in which we operate. We implemented work-from-home protocols at all of our administrative locations late in the first quarter of 2020, and while some locations have returned, other locations, including our headquarters location, continue to work remotely. In addition, we implemented additional safety measures specific to COVID-19 at all of our operating locations, which did not significantly increase our costs. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the national and local economies in which we operate, and ultimately our business, will depend on numerous developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. These events, as they continue to develop, could result in business disruption, including reduced revenues, profitability and cash flow.\n(1)Adjusted Cash Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Cash Gross Profit as a percentage of net revenue.\n\u2022According to the Texas Department of Transportation ( TXDOT\u201d), annual funding available for transportation infrastructure, including state and federal funding, is estimated to average $14.9 billion in total for fiscal year 2021 (which commenced September 1, 2020) and fiscal year 2022 combined. Further, the 2021 Unified Transportation Program ( UTP\u201d) approved by the Texas Transportation Commission in September 2020 provides for $75 billion through fiscal year 2030 to fund transportation projects; more than double the fiscal year 2016 level, which was prior to the Proposition 1 and Proposition 7 funding initiatives. The funding available in any given year is separate and distinct from lettings, or the process of providing notice, issuing proposals, receiving proposals, and awarding contracts. In January 2021, TXDOT updated its fiscal year 2021 lettings estimate to $9.6 billion up from $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2020 and $8.9 billion in fiscal year 2019. Longer term, TXDOT has indicated a target of $8 billion per year in total state and local lettings. The Texas Comptroller released its biennial revenue estimate for fiscal year 2022 - 2023 in January 2021 and expects economic output to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, and despite revenue shortfalls due to COVID-19 it is expected that the state highway fund will be granted its full allotment of $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2021 and 2022 from Proposition 7 funding.\n(4)The total amount payable under our TRA is estimated at $321.7 million as of January 2, 2021. Under the terms of the TRA, payment of amounts benefiting us is due to the pre-IPO owners within four months of the tax returns being submitted to the respective regulatory agencies when the benefits are realized. We are currently estimating benefits next being realized in the 2021 tax year, and paid to TRA holders in early 2023. The estimated timing of TRA payments is subject to a number of factors, primarily around the timing of the generation of future taxable income in future years, which will be impacted by business activity in those periods.\nLevel 2 inputs are typically used to estimate the fair value of acquired machinery, equipment and land and assumed liabilities for asset retirement obligations, environmental remediation and compliance obligations and contingencies.\n\u2022Net income of $141.2 million, adjusted for $235.4 million of non-cash expenses, including $227.8 million of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, $28.9 million of share-based compensation and $(18.4) million of change in deferred tax asset, net.\n______________________\nWe recognize claims when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its legally enforceable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim.\nOperating Activities\nAs a result of the change in control provisions and the early termination right, Summit Inc. could be required to make payments under the TRA that are greater than or less than the specified percentage of the actual cash tax savings that Summit Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA (although any such overpayment would be taken into account in calculating future payments, if any, under the TRA) or that are prior to the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. Also, the obligations of Summit Inc. would be automatically accelerated and be immediately due and payable in the event that Summit Inc. breaches any of its material obligations under the agreement and in certain events of bankruptcy or liquidation. In these situations, our obligations under the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity.\nThe Cement segment's percent changes in sales volumes and pricing in 2020 from 2019 were as follows:\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the definition of and the reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n\nAs of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, Summit Inc. had a valuation allowance of $1.7 million and $1.7 million against our deferred tax assets, respectively.\nRevenue derived from the sale of construction materials is recognized when risks associated with ownership have passed to unaffiliated customers. Typically this occurs when products are shipped. Product revenue generally includes sales of aggregates, cement and related downstream products and other materials to customers, net of discounts or allowances and taxes, if any.\n(3)Amounts represent purchase commitments entered into in the normal course of business, primarily for fuel purchases, the terms of which are generally one year.\nRevenue from asphalt decreased $23.1 million in 2020, which was mainly attributable to lower volumes in Kentucky, due to the items mentioned above, which more than offset strong asphalt volumes in Kansas. Asphalt pricing decreased 3.3% in 2020, as lower prices occurred in most of our markets. Paving and related service revenue decreased $40.2 million in 2020, primarily due to lower activity in Kentucky as noted above.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction, and therefore represents an exit price. A fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants, considering the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible at the measurement date. We assign the highest level of fair value available to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the following options:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $337.2 million primarily as a result of:\nWe paid cash of $123.5 million and $5.4 million, net of cash acquired, in business combinations and allocated this amount to assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the years ended January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively.\nOn an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to the valuation of accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, pension and other postretirement obligations and asset retirement obligations. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nIn addition to federal funding, state, county and local agencies provide highway construction and maintenance funding. Our four largest states by revenue, Texas, Utah, Kansas and Missouri, represented approximately 25%, 14%, 13% and 9%, respectively, of our total revenue in 2020. The following is a summary of key funding initiatives in those states:\nThe West segment's operating income increased $67.3 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA increased $66.1 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. The increases in operating income and Adjusted EBITDA occurred as the weather conditions in 2020 have been generally more favorable as compared to 2019, which has resulted in operational efficiencies and increased sales volumes. The operating margin percentage in the West segment increased in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to the impact of the same factors noted above.\n______________________\nOn June 1, 2017, the Issuers issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due June 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes were issued at par value, resulting in proceeds of $295.4 million, net of related fees and expenses. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year commencing on December 1, 2017.\nThe table below sets forth additional details regarding our four key states, including growth rates as compared to the U.S. as a whole:\nCost of revenue consists of all direct production and delivery costs and primarily includes labor, repair and maintenance, utilities, raw materials, fuel, transportation, subcontractor costs, and royalties. Our cost of revenue is directly affected by fluctuations in commodity energy prices, primarily diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. As a result, our adjusted cash gross profit margins can be significantly affected by changes in the underlying cost of certain raw materials if they are not recovered through corresponding changes in revenue. We attempt to limit our exposure to changes in commodity energy prices by entering into forward purchase commitments when appropriate. In addition, we have sales price adjustment provisions that provide for adjustments based on fluctuations outside a limited range in certain energy-related production costs. These provisions are in place for most of our public infrastructure contracts, and we seek to include similar price adjustment provisions in our private contracts.\nNet revenue in the East segment decreased $1.0 million in 2020 over 2019, as the decrease in asphalt and paving and services revenues exceeded the increase in aggregates and ready-mix concrete revenues. Organic aggregate volumes increased 3.0% in 2020 over 2019 levels, while organic aggregate pricing decreased 2.1%. Organic ready mix volumes and pricing increased 11.2% and 4.6%, respectively. Due to weakness in our Kentucky market, organic asphalt volumes decreased (7.9)% in 2020 over 2019 levels, and paving and related services revenue decreased $40.2 million.\nThe following table presents, as of January 2, 2021, our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts and contingent commitments (in thousands).\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our net cash provided by and used for operating, investing and financing activities and our capital expenditures for the periods indicated:\n\nAmortization expense is the periodic expense related to leasehold improvements and intangible assets. The intangible assets were recognized with certain acquisitions and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the underlying asset or the remaining lease term.\nSummit LLC's Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement, should be no greater than 4.75:1.0 as of each quarter-end. As of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, Summit LLC was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nDepreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion\nDuring the year ended January 2, 2021, cash used in financing activities was $16.8 million. We received $700.0 million from proceeds of debt issuance, which was offset by $33.3 million of payments on acquisition related liabilities and $674.0 million in debt payments, which includes $14.4 million of finance lease cash payments. Our future payments under our finance lease obligations are expected to decrease slightly from 2020 levels.\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. The evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. The estimated future cash flows are derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry and markets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the affect such events might have on our reported values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOther-We are obligated under various firm purchase commitments for certain raw materials and services that are in the ordinary course of business. Management does not expect any significant changes in the market value of these goods and services during the commitment period that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. The terms of the purchase commitments generally approximate one year.\nUse and consumption of our products fluctuate due to seasonality. Nearly all of the products used by us, and by our customers, in the private construction or public infrastructure industries are used outdoors. Our highway operations and production and distribution facilities are also located outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in particular extended rainy and cold weather in the spring and fall and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, heavy snows and flooding, can adversely affect our business and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year typically result in higher activity and revenue levels during those quarters. The first quarter of our fiscal year typically has lower levels of activity due to weather conditions.\nWe estimate that we will invest between $200 million and $220 million in capital expenditures in 2021, which includes $25 - $35 million for our greenfield development projects. The timing of our greenfield expenditures is dependent upon the timing of when permits may be issued. We expect to fund our capital expenditure program through cash on hand, cash from operations, outside financing arrangements and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nThe key components of our operating costs and expenses consist of the following:\nPrior to eliminations of intercompany transactions, the net effect of volume and pricing changes on gross revenue for the year ended January 2, 2021 was approximately $79.4 million and $26.7 million, respectively.\nSummit Inc. is a corporation subject to income taxes in the United States. Certain subsidiaries, including Summit Holdings, or subsidiary groups of the Company are taxable separate from Summit Inc. The provisions for income taxes, or Summit Inc.'s proportional share of the provision, are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nSummit LLC's wholly-owned domestic subsidiary companies, subject to certain exclusions and exceptions, are named as subsidiary guarantors of the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition, Summit LLC has pledged substantially all of its assets as collateral, subject to certain exclusions and exceptions, for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\n\nThe annual goodwill test is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is determined that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test, otherwise further analysis is not required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether we choose to perform the qualitative assessment or proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nDuring the year ended January 2, 2021, cash used for investing activities was $285.6 million, of which $123.5 million related to acquisitions completed in the period and $177.2 million was invested in capital expenditures, which was partially offset by $14.0 million of proceeds from asset sales.\n______________________\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.\n______________________\nLoss on Debt Financings\nOn March 15, 2019, the Issuers issued $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.500% senior notes due March 15, 2027. The 2027 Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value with proceeds of $296.3 million, net of related fees and expenses. Interest on the 2027 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year commencing on September 15, 2019.\n\n* Revenue by product includes intercompany and intracompany sales transferred at market value. The elimination of intracompany transactions is included in Other. Revenue from the liquid asphalt terminals is included in asphalt revenue.\nRevenue from aggregates in the East segment increased $4.4 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. Aggregate volumes in 2020 increased 3.5%, primarily due to organic growth in our Kansas markets from wind farm and other large non-residential project activity, offset by volume decreases in our Missouri and Kentucky markets. Our volumes decreased in Kentucky as the state continues to deal with lower tax revenues that preceded COVID-19, and those revenues further decreased after the onset of COVID-19. Aggregates pricing decreased 2.1% in 2020 due primarily to product mix in Missouri and Kentucky.\nThe percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over multiple periods, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the effect of delayed performance, and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. These estimates are based on our best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. We review our contract estimates regularly to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion. Inherent uncertainties in estimating costs make it at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change within the near term and over the life of the contracts. No material adjustments to a contract were recognized in the year ended January 2, 2021.\n\u2022Net revenue increased 5.1% or $104.1 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily resulting from organic growth and to a lesser extent, contributions from our acquisitions.\n______________________\nThe East segment's percent changes in sales volumes and pricing in 2020 as compared to 2019 were as follows:\nhistorically been a relatively stable portion of state and federal budgets. Residential and nonresidential construction consists of new construction and repair and remodel markets. Any economic stagnation or decline, which could vary by local region and market, could affect our results of operations. Our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical changes in construction spending, especially in the private sector. From a macroeconomic view, we see positive indicators for the construction sector, including positive trends in highway obligations, housing starts and construction employment.\nIncome Taxes\nCommitments and Contingencies\n\u2022the timing of exchanges-for instance, the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair market value, which may fluctuate over time, of the depreciable or amortizable assets of Summit Holdings at the time of each exchange;\n______________________\nFurthermore, Summit Inc. may elect to terminate the TRA early by making an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future cash tax savings. In determining such anticipated future cash tax savings, the TRA includes several assumptions, including that (i) any LP Units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the shares of Class A common stock at the time of termination, (ii) Summit Inc. will have sufficient taxable income in each future taxable year to fully realize all potential tax savings, (iii) Summit Inc. will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize any remaining net operating losses subject to the TRA on a straight line basis over the shorter of the statutory expiration period for such net operating losses or the five-year period after the early termination or change of control, (iv) the tax rates for future years will be those specified in the law as in effect at the time of termination and (v) certain non-amortizable assets are deemed disposed of within specified time periods. In addition, the present value of such anticipated future cash tax savings are discounted at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points.\n\nFinancial Highlights- Year ended January 2, 2021\n\u2022In December 2020, new Missouri legislation was submitted that calls for five consecutive years of a two-cent gas tax increase starting in January 2022, which would raise an incremental $100 million of revenue annually; Missouri currently has the second-lowest motor fuel tax in the United States at 17 cents per gallon. Despite the impact of COVID-19, the Missouri Department of Transportation had one of its strongest construction programs on record with payments to contractors of $821 million in calendar year-to-date November 2020 versus $662 million in the prior period and has now scheduled or is scheduled to let during the remainder of fiscal year 2021 (which commenced July 1, 2020) the entire $360 million of construction projects delayed in early 2020 as a result of COVID-19.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\u2022Billed and unbilled accounts receivable increased by $31.5 million in fiscal 2019 as a result of increased revenue from our acquisitions as compared to fiscal 2018.\n\u2022In December 2020, Utah updated its revenue estimate for transportation funding to $639 million in fiscal year 2021 (which commenced July 1, 2020) up from $614 million in fiscal year 2020, with growth driven by increases in vehicle registration fees, diesel fuel tax and other revenue sources. In January 2020, the Utah Department of Transportation increased fees on electric and hybrid vehicles by 50% in 2020 and another 33% in 2021 and launched an alternative to a road usage charge program for those vehicles in the form of a pay per mile charge. In December 2019, Utah passed new legislation imposing a 4.85% sales tax on gas purchases and a 6 cents per gallon increase to the diesel tax, with an additional 4 cents per gallon diesel tax increase in 2022. The tax is estimated to generate an additional $170 million for transportation investment in 2021.\nAccretion expense is the periodic expense recorded for the accrued mining reclamation liabilities and landfill closure and post-closure liabilities using the effective interest method.\nSegment Results of Operations\nOur Long-Term Debt\n\u2022the amount and timing of our income-Summit Inc. is required to pay 85% of the cash tax savings, if any, as and when realized. If Summit Inc. does not have taxable income, Summit Inc. is not required (absent a change of control or circumstances requiring an early termination payment) to make payments under the TRA for that taxable year because no cash tax savings will have been realized. However, any tax attributes that do not result in realized benefits in a given tax year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate benefits in previous or future tax years. The utilization of such tax attributes will result in cash tax savings that will result in payments under the tax receivable agreement; and\nSummit LLC has credit facilities that provide for term loans in an aggregate amount of $650 million and revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount of $345 million (the \"Senior Secured Credit Facilities\"). Under the terms of Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as amended through February 2019, required principal payments of 0.25% of the refinanced aggregate amount of term debt are due on the last business day of each March, June, September and December. The unpaid principal balance is due in full on the maturity date of November 21, 2024.\n______________________\nExchanges of LP Units for shares of Class A common stock are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Summit Holdings. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of tax that Summit Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a TRA with the holders of LP Units that provides for the payment by Summit Inc. to exchanging holders of LP Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Summit Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. The increases in tax basis as a result of an exchange of LP Units for shares of Class A common stock, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, are difficult to accurately estimate as they will vary depending upon a number of factors, including:\nOur business is capital intensive. We carry property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet at cost, net of applicable depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis or based on the economic usage over the estimated useful life of the asset. The general range of depreciable lives by category, excluding mineral reserves, which are depleted based on the units of production method on a site-by-site basis, is as follows:\nOur acquisition strategy has historically required us to raise capital through equity issuances or debt financings. As of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, our long-term borrowings totaled $1.9 billion, for which we incurred $91.2 million and $102.0 million of interest expense, respectively. Our senior secured revolving facility has been adequate to fund our\nFinancing Activities\nOperating margin percentage for the year ended January 2, 2021 decreased to 20.4% from 22.3% in the prior year, primarily due to the same factors noted above.\nOverview\n(d)Under the terms of our credit facilities, we include EBITDA from our acquisitions, net of dispositions, in each fiscal year for periods prior to acquisition. We believe this provides our lenders with a more meaningful view of our EBITDA across all periods by making the information more comparable.\nWhen the contract includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. The amount of estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price is the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Types of variable consideration include, but are not limited to, liquidated damages and other performance penalties and production and placement bonuses.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, cash used for investing activities was $162.8 million, of which $5.4 million related to acquisitions completed in the period and $177.5 million was invested in capital expenditures, which was partially offset by $21.2 million of proceeds from asset sales.\n______________________\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following discussion of our results of operations is focused on the key financial measures we use to evaluate the performance of our business from both a consolidated and operating segment perspective. Operating income and margins are discussed in terms of changes in volume, pricing and mix of revenue source (i.e., type of product sales or service revenue). We focus on operating margin, which we define as operating income as a percentage of net revenue, as a key metric when assessing the performance of the business, as we believe that analyzing changes in costs in relation to changes in revenue provides more meaningful insight into the results of operations than examining costs in isolation.\nAs a vertically-integrated company, we include intercompany sales from materials to products and from products to services when assessing the operating results of our business. We refer to revenue inclusive of intercompany sales as gross revenue. These intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Gross revenue by line of business was as follows:\nWe regularly review strategic long-term plans, including potential investments in value-added acquisitions of related or similar businesses, which would increase our market share and/or are related to our existing markets. When an acquisition is completed, our consolidated statement of operations includes the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition, which is the date that control is obtained. The purchase price is determined based on the estimated fair value of assets given to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions and the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized, can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and periods subsequent to a business combination.\nWe periodically evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets resulting from the exchange of LP Units for Class A common stock. Our evaluation considers all sources of taxable income; all evidence, both positive and negative, is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all\n\nThe Company evaluates the tax positions taken on income tax returns that remain open and positions expected to be taken on the current year tax returns to identify uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized is recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax benefit.\nWe expended approximately $177.2 million in capital expenditures for the year ended January 2, 2021 compared to $177.5 million and $220.7 million in the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nCash Paid for Capital Expenditures\nLevel 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly-traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly-traded long-term debt.\nGross revenue from aggregates in the West segment increased $38.9 million in 2020 over 2019, primarily due to an increase in sales volumes that more than offset a slight decrease in average sales price. Aggregates volumes increased in 2020 mainly in our Texas markets which had organic growth coupled with increased acquisition volumes, and increased organic volumes in our Intermountain markets. In 2020, organic aggregate volumes decreased in the Vancouver, British Columbia area due to COVID-19 related delays in projects. Aggregates pricing in 2020 decreased 0.8% when compared to 2019, due to product mix primarily in our Texas markets, resulting primarily from the impact of lower prices on acquisition related volumes.\nContractual Obligations\nGross revenue from asphalt in the West segment increased $31.2 million and asphalt volumes increased 10.3% in 2020, due to organic volume and price increases. Average sales prices for asphalt increased 2.9% in 2020. Gross revenue for paving and related services in the West segment increased by $76.4 million in 2020 due to greater activity in our North Texas markets, partially offset by our Intermountain geography and in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nPrior to eliminations of intercompany transactions, the net effect of volume and pricing changes on gross revenue for the year ended January 2, 2021 was approximately $6.9 million and $(1.3) million, respectively.\nWe are one of the fastest growing construction materials companies in the United States, with a 63% increase in revenue between the year ended January 2, 2016 (the year of our initial public offering) and the year ended January 2, 2021. Within our markets, we offer customers a single-source provider for construction materials and related downstream products through our vertical integration. Our materials include aggregates, which we supply across the United States, and in British Columbia, Canada, and cement, which we supply to surrounding states along the Mississippi River from Minnesota to Louisiana. In addition to supplying aggregates to customers, we use a portion of our materials internally to produce ready-mix concrete and asphalt paving mix, which may be sold externally or used in our paving and related services businesses. Our vertical integration creates opportunities to increase aggregates volumes, optimize margin at each stage of production and provide customers with efficiency gains, convenience and reliability, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage.\nRevenue from ready-mix concrete in the East segment increased $24.3 million in 2020, as we realized higher organic volumes and pricing in all of our markets except Virginia. In 2020, ready-mix concrete volumes increased 11.2%, and average sales prices increased 4.6%.\n\n\n\u2022Net income of $61.1 million, adjusted for $249.7 million of non-cash expenses, including $222.9 million of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, $20.4 million of share-based compensation and $16.0 million of change in deferred tax asset, net.\n(2)Pricing is shown on a per ton basis for aggregates, cement and asphalt and on a per cubic yard basis for ready-mix concrete.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings are composed principally of revenue recognized on contracts on the percentage of completion method for which billings had not been presented to customers because the amounts were not billable under the contract terms at the balance sheet date. In accordance with the contract terms, the unbilled receivables at the balance sheet date are expected to be billed in following periods. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represent billings in excess of revenue recognized.\n\u2022Level 3-Unobservable inputs, which includes the use of valuation models.\n\u2022In January 2021, the Governor of Kansas submitted a revised budget for fiscal year 2021 (which commenced July 1, 2020) and an initial budget recommendation for fiscal year 2022 with $1.9 billion in transportation funding budgeted in 2021 and $2.2 billion for 2022. Transfers from the State Highway Fund ( SHF\u201d) to the State General Fund ( SGF\u201d) are expected to be eliminated by fiscal year 2023 with $134 million currently estimated to be transferred to the SGF in fiscal year 2021 and $67 million in fiscal year 2022. The elimination of transfers out of the SHF is expected to help pave the way for the issuance of new transportation bonds and keep funds available to continue moving forward the 10-year, $10 billion Eisenhower Legacy Plan that was approved by the Kansas Legislature in early 2020. The Eisenhower Legacy Plan selects new modernization and expansion projects every two years, requires previously selected projects under the prior T-Works program to be let prior to July 1, 2023 and levies 16.2% of the state sales tax for the benefit of the SHF.\nTax Receivable Agreement (Benefit) Expense\nWe anticipate funding payments under the TRA from cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facilities. As of January 2, 2021, we had accrued $321.7 million as TRA liability. The entire TRA liability is a long term liability as no additional payments are expected in the next twelve months.\nInvesting Activities\n(2)Source: 2019 PCA\nDetail of our volumes and average selling prices by product for the years ended January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019 were as follows:\n______________________\n\u2022Billed and unbilled accounts receivable decreased by $10.0 million in fiscal 2020 as a result of the seasonality of our business. The majority of our sales occur in the spring, summer and fall and we typically incur an increase in accounts receivable (net billed and unbilled) during the second and third quarters of each year. This amount is typically converted to cash in the fourth and first quarters.\nRevenue from cement decreased $8.5 million in 2020, as volume decreases of 4.6% were only partially offset by small organic cement pricing gains. We have historically implemented cement pricing increases in April each year; however, in 2020, those increases were deferred until June 1 as a result of COVID-19. We believe the decreases in volume are the result of COVID-19, primarily in southern markets, where the demand for cement is partially driven by the energy industry.\nWe derive our revenue predominantly by selling construction materials and products and providing paving and related services. Construction materials consist of aggregates and cement. Products consist of related downstream products, including ready-mix concrete, asphalt paving mix and concrete products. Paving and related services that we provide are primarily asphalt paving services.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nOn August 11, 2020, Summit LLC and Summit Finance (together, the Issuers\u201d) issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due January 15, 2029. The 2029 Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value with proceeds of $690.4 million, net of related fees and expenses. Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year commencing on January 15, 2021.\nThe U.S. construction materials industry is composed of four primary sectors: aggregates; cement; ready-mix concrete; and asphalt paving mix. Each of these materials is widely used in most forms of construction activity. Participants in these sectors typically range from small, privately-held companies focused on a single material, product or market to publicly traded multinational corporations that offer a wide array of construction materials and services. Competition is constrained in part by the distance materials can be transported efficiently, resulting in predominantly local or regional operations. Due to the lack of product differentiation, competition for all of our products is predominantly based on price and, to a lesser extent, quality of products and service. As a result, the prices we charge our customers are not likely to be materially different from the prices charged by other producers in the same markets. Accordingly, our profitability is generally dependent on the level of demand for our materials and products and our ability to control operating costs.\n______________________\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTax Receivable Agreement\ncarrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we proceed to the second step to measure the amount of potential impairment loss.\nNet revenue in the Cement segment decreased $20.1 million in 2020 over 2019, primarily due to decreased organic cement volumes of 4.6%. In addition, an explosion in April 2020 that shut down our solid waste processing facility contributed to the revenue decline in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nThere were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of January 2, 2021 or December 28, 2019. As of January 2, 2021, we had remaining borrowing capacity of $329.1 million under the revolving credit facility, which is net of $15.9 million of outstanding letters of credit. The outstanding letters of credit are renewed annually and support required bonding on construction projects and the Company's insurance liabilities.\n_____________________\nThe majority of contract modifications relate to the original contract and are often an extension of the original performance obligation. Predominately, modifications are not distinct from the terms in the original contract; therefore, they are considered part of a single performance obligation. We account for the modification using a cumulative catch-up adjustment. However, there are instances where goods or services in a modification are distinct from those transferred prior to the\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $8.2 million. We received $19.1 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and $300.0 million from proceeds of debt issuance, which was offset by $33.9 million of payments on acquisition related liabilities and $270.2 million in debt payments.\nIn March 2018, we were notified of an investigation by the CCB into pricing practices by certain asphalt paving contractors in British Columbia, including Winvan. We believe the investigation is focused on time periods prior to our April 2017 acquisition of Winvan and we are cooperating with the CCB. Although we currently do not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the investigation at this time.\nOther Financial Information\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Cash Gross Profit and Adjusted Cash Gross Margin for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyses. The investment community often uses these metrics to assess the operating performance of a company's business and to provide a consistent comparison of performance from period to period. We use these metrics, among others, to assess the operating performance of our individual segments and the consolidated company.\n\u2022Our operating income increased 5.4% or $11.6 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, as pricing and volume increases exceeded the increases in cost of revenue.\nCement Segment\n\n\u2022the extent to which such exchanges are taxable-if an exchange is not taxable for any reason, increased deductions will not be available;\nThe tables below reconcile our net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and present Adjusted EBITDA by segment and reconcile operating income to Adjusted Cash Gross Profit for the periods indicated:\nTotal Revenue\nRevenue from ready-mix concrete increased $60.3 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, our ready-mix volumes increased 5.0% and our average sales prices increased 4.7%. These volume and price increases in 2020 occurred in both the West and East segments. Volumes in the Intermountain, Texas and Kansas geographies were impacted by more favorable weather conditions during 2020 as compared to 2019.\nRevenue derived from paving and related services is recognized using the percentage of completion method, which approximates progress towards completion. Under the percentage of completion method, we recognize paving and related services revenue as services are rendered. The majority of our construction service contracts are completed within one year, but may occasionally extend beyond this time frame. The majority of our construction service contracts, and therefore, revenue, are opened and completed within one year, with most activity during the spring, summer and fall. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on input measures. We generally measure progress toward completion on long-term paving and related services contracts based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. We include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the cumulative catch-up method, under which the effect of revisions in estimates is recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the period it is identified.\nOur general and administrative expenses in 2020 increased $32.2 million over 2019, due primarily to increased incentive compensation expenses, and expenses recognized in connection with the transition of our chief executive officer. Our stock based compensation expense increased $8.5 million over 2019, primarily due to additional equity grants related to the transition of our chief executive officer.\nFor the years ended January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, our Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio was 0.51 to 1.00 and 0.80 to 1.00, respectively, based on consolidated first lien net debt of $254.5 million and $369.4 million as of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively, divided by Further Adjusted EBITDA of $496.5 million and $461.5 million for the years ended January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively. As of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. Historical results may not be indicative of future performance. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements.

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data,\u201d our audited consolidated annual financial statements and the related notes thereto and other information included in this report. A discussion and analysis of our results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 may be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 5, 2020, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare such financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\n(2)For the year ended December 28, 2019, we negotiated a $2.0 million reduction in the amount of a contingent liability from one of our acquisitions. For the year ended December 29, 2018, we negotiated a $6.9 million reduction in the amount of a contingent liability from one of our acquisitions. As we had passed the period to revise the opening balance sheet for this acquisition, the adjustment was recorded as other income.\nThe West segment's percent changes in sales volumes and pricing comparing 2020 to 2019 were as follows:\nOur revenue is derived from multiple end-use markets including public infrastructure construction and private residential and nonresidential construction. Public infrastructure includes spending by federal, state, provincial and local governments for roads, highways, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. Public infrastructure projects have\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash on-hand, cash provided by our operations and amounts available for borrowing under our credit facilities and capital-raising activities in the debt capital markets. In addition to our current sources of liquidity, we have access to liquidity through public offerings of shares of our Class A common stock. To facilitate such offerings, in January 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that is effective for a term of three years and will expire in January 2023. The amount of Class A common stock to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific limit on the amount we may issue. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of the proceeds thereof, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.\n\n(1)Percentages based on our revenue by state for the year ended January 2, 2021 and management's estimates as to end markets.\n* Revenue from waste processing and the elimination of intracompany transactions are included in Other.\nIn August 2020, we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2029 Notes to redeem all of the outstanding 2023 Notes. In connection with that transaction, charges of $4.1 million were recognized in fiscal 2020. The charges included $0.8 million for the write-off of unamortized original issue discount and $3.3 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees.\n(a)Represents the transaction expenses associated with closed and probable acquisitions, consisting primarily of accounting, legal, valuation and financial advisory fees for the acquisitions.\n\nWe believe we have access to sufficient financial resources from our liquidity sources to fund our business and operations, including contractual obligations, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, for at least the next twelve months. Our growth strategy contemplates future acquisitions for which we believe we have sufficient access to capital.\nOur income tax benefit was $12.2 million for the year ended January 2, 2021 as compared to income tax expense of $17.1 million for the year ended December 28, 2019. Our effective tax rate for Summit Inc. differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to (1) unrecognized tax benefits, (2) changes in the valuation allowance, (3) state taxes, (4) tax depletion expense in excess of the expense recorded under U.S. GAAP, (5) the minority interest in the Summit Holdings partnership that is allocated outside of the Company and (6) various other items such as limitations on meals and entertainment, certain stock compensation and other costs. The Company's income tax provision is calculated under the provisions of the final regulations related to tax reform legislation, which may limit our ability to deduct interest expense in calculating our taxable income. All adjustments resulting from the issuance of the final regulations have been recorded.\nGross revenue from ready-mix concrete in the West segment increased $36.0 million in 2020 over 2019. For the year ended January 2, 2021, organic ready-mix concrete prices increased 4.7%. For the year ended January 2, 2021, our ready-mix concrete organic volumes increased 3.0%, as volume increases in the Intermountain geographies were offset by volume decreases in North Texas. We continue to see strong residential volumes in the Salt Lake City and Houston areas, while volumes in the Permian basin area have decreased due to an economic slowdown in that area.\nRevenue from cement decreased $8.5 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, organic cement volumes decreased 4.6% and organic cement average sales prices increased 1.5%, respectively, as compared to 2019.\nseasonal working capital needs and certain acquisitions. We had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility as of January 2, 2021.\nGenerally, construction contracts contain mobilization costs which are categorized as costs to fulfill a contract. These costs are excluded from any measure of progress toward contract fulfillment. These costs do not result in the transfer of control of a good or service to the customer and are amortized over the life of the contract.\n\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, below.\n______________________\nThe table below includes revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated. Operating income (loss) by segment is computed as earnings before interest, loss on debt financings, tax receivable agreement expense, gain on sale of business, other income / expense and taxes.\n(2)Future payments to fund our defined benefit plans are estimated based on multiple assumptions which are enumerated in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nService Revenue Recognition\nIn addition, the TRA provides that upon certain changes of control, Summit Inc.'s (or its successor's) obligations would be based on certain assumptions, including that Summit Inc. would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from tax basis and other tax attributes subject to the TRA. With respect to our obligations under the TRA relating to previously exchanged or acquired LP Units and certain net operating losses, we would be required to make a payment equal to the present value (at a discount rate equal to one year LIBOR plus 100 basis points) of the anticipated future tax benefits determined using assumptions (ii) through (v) of the following paragraph.\nAcquisitions-Purchase Price Allocation\n\ninternational producers as we did in 2019. As such, our overall operating costs increased in 2020 over 2019. We believe our lower sales volumes are related to COVID-19, notably in our southern markets. Additionally, our solid waste processing facility that provides fuel for one of our plants remained closed to processing solid waste due to an explosion in April 2020, which also increased our operating costs. We expect to receive the necessary approvals to reopen that facility sometime late in the first quarter 2021.\nGoodwill\nOperating income (loss) reflects our profit after taking into consideration cost of revenue, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion and gain on sale of property, plant and equipment. Cost of revenue generally increases ratably with revenue, as labor, transportation costs and subcontractor costs are recorded in cost of revenue. In periods where our revenue growth occurs primarily through acquisitions, general and administrative expenses and depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion have historically grown ratably with revenue. However, as organic volumes increase, we expect these costs, as a percentage of revenue, to decrease. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue vary throughout the year due to the seasonality of our business.\nIn March 2019, we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 6.500% senior notes due March 15, 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\") to redeem all of the outstanding 8.500% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d). In connection with this transaction, charges of $14.6 million were recognized in fiscal 2019. The charges included $11.7 million for the applicable prepayment premium and $2.9 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees.\n* Revenue by product includes intercompany and intracompany sales transferred at market value. The elimination of intracompany transactions is included in Other. Revenue from the liquid asphalt terminals is included in asphalt revenue.\nThe principal factors in evaluating our financial condition and operating results for the year ended January 2, 2021 are:\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nOur TRA benefit for the year ended January 2, 2021 was $7.6 million as compared to TRA expense of $16.2 million in the year ended December 28, 2019. Each year, we update our estimate as to when TRA payments will be made. When payments are made under the TRA, a portion of the payment made will be characterized as imputed interest under IRS regulations. We also updated our estimate of the state income tax rate that will be in effect at the date the TRA payments are made. As a result of updated state income tax rate, and the imputed interest limitation noted above, we decreased our TRA liability by $7.6 million as of January 2, 2021 and increased our TRA liability by $16.2 million as of December 28, 2019.\nof the deferred tax assets. If the deferred tax assets are determined to be realizable, we then assess whether payment of amounts under the TRA have become probable. If so, we record a TRA liability of 85% of such deferred tax assets. In subsequent periods, we assess the realizability of all of our deferred tax assets subject to the TRA. Should we determine a deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance is realizable in a subsequent period, the related valuation allowance will be released and consideration of a corresponding TRA liability will be assessed. The realizability of deferred tax assets, including those subject to the TRA, is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those deferred tax assets become deductible and consideration of prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs, including stock-based compensation charges, for our sales and marketing, administration, finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and certain managerial employees. Additional expenses include audit, consulting and professional fees, travel, insurance, rental costs, property taxes and other corporate and overhead expenses.\nWe evaluate our operating performance using metrics that we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA,\u201d Adjusted Cash Gross Profit\u201d and Adjusted Cash Gross Margin\u201d which are not defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted to exclude accretion, loss on debt financings, loss from discontinued operations and certain non-cash and non-operating items. We define Adjusted Cash Gross Profit as operating income before general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion and transaction costs and Adjusted Cash Gross Margin as Adjusted Cash Gross Profit as a percentage of net revenue.\nIn conjunction with our annual review of goodwill on the first day of the fourth quarter, we performed the qualitative assessment for our reporting units. In 2020, we performed a two-step quantitative analysis on four of our reporting units. Step 1 of that analysis compares the estimated the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach (i.e., a discounted cash flow technique) and a market approach to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value exceeds its\n\u2022The timing of payments associated with accounts payable and accrued expenses of cash, which is consistent with the seasonality of our business whereby we build-up inventory levels and incur repairs and maintenance costs to ready the business for increased sales volumes in the summer and fall. These costs are typically incurred in the first half of the year and paid by year-end. In addition, we made $99.6 million of interest payments in 2020. Our cash interest payments are expected to decrease slightly from this amount in 2021 and beyond.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\n______________________\nComponents of Operating Results\n(1)The reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is based on the financial results of Summit Inc. and its subsidiaries, which was $20.5 million greater, $27.5 million less and 27.5 million less than Summit LLC and its subsidiaries in the years ended January 2, 2021, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, due to interest expense associated with a deferred consideration obligation, TRA expense and income tax benefit are obligations of Summit Holdings and Summit Inc., respectively, and are thus excluded from Summit LLC's consolidated net income.\nWe earn revenue from the provision of services, which are primarily paving and related services, but also include landfill operations and the receipt and disposal of waste that is converted to fuel for use in our cement plants. Revenue from the receipt of waste fuels is recognized when the waste is accepted and a corresponding liability is recognized for the costs to process the waste into fuel for the manufacturing of cement or to ship the waste offsite for disposal in accordance with applicable regulations.\nNet revenue increased $104.1 million in the year ended January 2, 2021, primarily resulting from organic growth in our aggregates and ready-mix concrete operations. Of the increase in net revenue, $80.5 million was from increased sales of products, $19.7 million from increased sales of materials and $3.9 million from increased service revenue. We generated organic volume growth of 3.6%, 5.0% and 4.7% in aggregates, ready-mix concrete and asphalt, respectively, during 2020 over the prior year period, while our organic cement volumes declined 4.6% compared to 2019. We had organic price growth in our cement, ready-mix and asphalt lines of business of 1.5%, 4.7% and 1.4%, respectively, during 2020. Operating income increased by $11.6 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily as net revenue gains exceeded increases in costs of revenue and general and administrative expenses.\n* Revenue by product includes intercompany and intracompany sales transferred at market value. The elimination of intracompany transactions is included in Other. Revenue from the liquid asphalt terminals is included in asphalt revenue.\nOperating income in the East segment decreased $32.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $25.4 million in 2020 over 2019, primarily due to lower margins on our asphalt and paving business, which resulted from decreased activity in Kentucky. In addition, our organic sales prices decreased in Missouri as 2019 included more higher priced flood and levy volumes. Further, our Kentucky operations worked to sell lower priced inventory to generate cash flow. Operating margin percentage in 2020 decreased to 9.7% from 14.2% in 2019, due to the items noted above.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we had $418.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $570.6 million of working capital as compared to $311.3 million and $497.0 million, respectively, at December 28, 2019. Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. There were no restricted cash balances as of January 2, 2021 or December 28, 2019.\nThere is a measurement period after the acquisition date during which we may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination. Any such adjustments are based on us obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction. The measurement period ends once we have obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded in earnings.\nGiven the seasonality of our business, we typically experience significant fluctuations in working capital needs and balances throughout the year. Our working capital requirements generally increase during the first half of the year as we build up inventory and focus on repair and maintenance and other set-up costs for the upcoming season. Working capital levels then decrease as the construction season winds down and we enter the winter months, which is when we see significant inflows of cash from the collection of receivables.\nUnder the two-step quantitative impairment test, step one of the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We use a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) model to estimate the current fair value of our reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including macroeconomic trends in the reporting unit's geographic area impacting private construction and public infrastructure industries, the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future sales and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. We also perform a market assessment of our enterprise value. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in the valuations are reasonable.\n(1) Corporate results primarily consist of compensation and office expenses for employees included in the Company's headquarters.\nEast Segment\nOur remaining borrowing capacity on our $345.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility as of January 2, 2021 was $329.1 million, which is net of $15.9 million of outstanding letters of credit, and is fully available to us within the terms and covenant requirements of our credit agreement.\nUnder the terms of the TRA, we can terminate the TRA at any time, which would trigger a cash payment to the pre-IPO owners. Based upon a $20.08 per share price of our Class A common stock, the closing price of our stock on January 2, 2021 and a contractually defined discount rate of 1.34%, we estimate that if we were to exercise our right to terminate the TRA, the aggregate amount required to settle the TRA would be approximately $312 million.\nAs market conditions warrant we may, from time to time, seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including Senior Notes and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities. Such transactions could be privately negotiated, open market transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may equate to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, which may reduce the trading liquidity of such class or series.\nThe table below sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:\nThe Company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the tax basis and financial statement amounts that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, as well as consideration of tax-planning strategies to determine whether we may seek to utilize any net operating loss carryforwards scheduled to expire in the near future. The estimates of future taxable income involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. Our judgments regarding future taxable income and future cash flows are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, are consistent with our internal planning. The computed deferred balances are based on enacted tax laws and applicable rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such a determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If the Company determines it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had been recorded, then an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n(1)Future interest payments were calculated using the applicable fixed and floating rates charged by our lenders in effect as of January 2, 2021 and may differ from actual results.\nCollectability of service contracts is due reasonably after certain milestones in the contract are performed. Milestones vary by project, but are typically calculated using monthly progress based on the percentage of completion or a customer's engineer review of progress. The majority of the time, collection occurs within 90 days of billing and cash is received within the same fiscal year as services performed. On most projects the customer will withhold a portion of the invoice for retainage which may last longer than a year depending on the job.\nGross revenue by product/service was as follows:\n\u2022The timing of payments associated with accounts payable and accrued expenses of cash, which is consistent with the seasonality of our business whereby we build-up inventory levels and incur repairs and maintenance costs to ready the business for increased sales volumes in the summer and fall. These costs are typically incurred in the first half of the year and paid by year-end. In addition, we made $104.6 million of interest payments in 2019.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to 2019\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\n\nmodification. In these situations, we account for the modifications as either a separate contract or prospectively depending on the facts and circumstances of the modification.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nResults of Operations\nTax Receivable Agreement- When Summit Inc. purchases LP Units for cash or LP Units are exchanged for shares of Class A common stock, this results in increases in Summit Inc.'s share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Summit Holdings, which increases the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to Summit Inc. These increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions are expected to reduce the amount of cash taxes that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. In connection with our IPO, we entered into a TRA with the holders of the LP Units and the pre-IPO owners that provides for the payment by Summit Inc. to exchanging holders of LP Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Summit Inc. actually realizes (or, under certain circumstances such as an early termination of the TRA is deemed to realize) as a result of (i) these increases in tax basis and (ii) our utilization of certain net operating losses of the pre-IPO owners and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA.\n\u2022Level 2-Observable inputs, other than quoted prices, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.\nThe Cement segment's operating income decreased $9.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $10.5 million in 2020. Although our sales volumes decreased, our production volumes increased as we did not purchase as much cement from\nBusiness Trends and Conditions\n\nRevenue from aggregates increased $43.2 million in the year ended January 2, 2021. In 2020, increases in our northern Texas and Virginia markets were partially offset by organic aggregate volumes declines in Missouri as flood repair work in 2020 was less than in 2019 and Kentucky due to COVID-19 impacts. Overall, our average sales price in 2020 decreased over 2019 primarily as the product mix shifted away from higher priced flood repair products to lower priced products and the impact of lower priced acquisition related sales volumes in Texas. For the year ended January 2, 2021, our aggregate volumes increased primarily due to acquisition volumes, and to a lesser extent, due to increased organic volumes. Aggregate volumes growth was attributable to organic growth in both the West and East segments. Organic aggregate volumes increased 3.6% in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in our North Texas, Intermountain West and Kansas markets. Aggregate average sales prices of $10.77 per ton decreased 2.0% in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower priced products in our Missouri markets and acquisition related volumes noted above.\n______________________\nTransportation infrastructure projects, driven by both federal and state funding programs, represent a significant share of the U.S. construction materials market. Federal funds are allocated to the states, which are required to match a portion of the federal funds they receive. Federal highway spending uses funds predominantly from the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which derives its revenue from taxes on diesel fuel, gasoline and other user fees. The dependability of federal funding allows the state departments of transportation to plan for their long term highway construction and maintenance needs. Funding for the existing federal transportation funding program was extended in late 2020 through 2021. With the nation's infrastructure aging, there is increased demand by states and municipalities for long-term federal funding to support the construction of new roads, highways and bridges in addition to the maintenance of the existing infrastructure.\n\u2022the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange-the increase in any tax deductions, as well as the tax basis increase in other assets, of Summit Holdings, is directly proportional to the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange;\n______________________\nLevel 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and leased mineral interests and other identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of mineral reserves and leased mineral interests are determined using an excess earnings approach, which require management to estimate future cash flows. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and forecasts determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price, volumes and expected profit margins, net of capital requirements. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business.\n\nWest Segment\n\u2022In August 2020, we issued $700.0 million of 5.250% senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes\u201d), resulting in net proceeds of $690.4 million, after related fees and expenses. The proceeds from the 2029 Notes were used to redeem the $650.0 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d) at par.\n(b)Represents non-cash equity-based compensation granted to employees.\nThe revolving credit facility bears interest per annum equal to, at Summit LLC's option, either (i) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus an applicable margin of 2.00% for base rate loans or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to\n(c)Represents the net (gain) loss recognized on assets identified for disposal.

Among other things, we are required to maintain a Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio that is no greater than 4.75 to 1.00. Our first lien net leverage ratio, for purposes of this maintenance requirement, is calculated following each quarter based on information for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial information is available by dividing our Consolidated First Lien Net Debt as of the end of such period by our Consolidated EBITDA for such period. Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of our senior secured credit facility is calculated in accordance with our presentation of Further Adjusted EBITDA below. We define Further Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA plus the EBITDA contribution of certain recent acquisitions.\nIn March 2019, using the proceeds from the 2027 Notes, all of the 2022 Notes were redeemed at a price equal to par plus an applicable premium and the indenture under which the 2022 Notes were issued was satisfied and discharged. As a result of the extinguishment, charges of $14.6 million were recognized in the quarter ended March 30, 2019, which included charges of $11.7 million for the applicable redemption premium and $2.9 million for the write-off of deferred financing fees.\nGross revenue by product/service was as follows:\nReuters prior to the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs plus an applicable margin of 3.00% for LIBOR rate loans.\nAt January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, $1.9 billion of total debt was outstanding under our respective debt agreements. Summit LLC's senior secured credit facilities provide for term loans in an aggregate amount of $650.0 million and revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount of $345.0 million (the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). Summit LLC's domestic wholly-owned subsidiary companies are named as guarantors of the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Certain other partially-owned subsidiaries, and the wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, Mainland, do not guarantee the Senior Notes or Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Summit LLC has pledged substantially all of its assets as collateral for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nEnvironmental Remediation and Site Restoration-Our operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and other regulatory matters. These operations require environmental operating permits, which are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. We regularly monitor and review its operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our business, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and noncompliance will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nGross revenue by product was as follows:\n\u2022Level 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWe are subject to commodity price risk with respect to price changes in liquid asphalt and energy, including fossil fuels and electricity for aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete and asphalt paving mix production, natural gas for hot mix asphalt production and diesel fuel for distribution vehicles and production related mobile equipment. Liquid asphalt escalator provisions in most of our private and commercial contracts limit our exposure to price fluctuations in this commodity. We often obtain similar escalators on public infrastructure contracts. In addition, we enter into various firm purchase commitments, with terms generally less than one year, for certain raw materials.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we determined that no events or circumstances from September 28, 2020 through January 2, 2021 indicated that a further assessment was necessary.\nDuring the year ended January 2, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $408.9 million primarily as a result of:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure below.\nFor the year ended January 2, 2021, our operating margin percentage remained flat as compared to the year ended December 28, 2019, due to the items noted above. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, increased by $23.6 million in the year ended January 2, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 28, 2019.\nCash Flows\nRevenue derived from paving and related services is recognized on the percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the cost incurred to date compared to estimated total cost of each project. This method is used because management considers cost incurred to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change over the life of the contract.\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we find helpful in monitoring the performance of our business. See the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, below.\n\nThe measurement of the TRA liability is accounted for as a contingent liability. Therefore, once we determine that a payment to a pre-IPO owner has become probable and can be estimated, the estimate of payment will be accrued.\nSenior Notes\nIn August 2020, using the proceeds from the 2029 Notes, all of the outstanding $650.0 million 6.125% senior notes due 2023 were redeemed at a price equal to par and the indenture under which the 2023 Notes were issued was satisfied and discharged. As a result of the extinguishment, charges of $4.1 million were recognized in the quarter ended September 26, 2020, which included charges of $0.8 million for the write-off of original issue discount and $3.3 million for the write-off of deferred financing fees.\n(1)The statement of operations above is based on the financial results of Summit Inc. and its subsidiaries, which was $20.5 million greater, $27.5 million less and $27.5 million less than Summit LLC and its subsidiaries in the years ended January 2, 2021, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, due to interest expense associated with a deferred consideration obligation, TRA expense and income tax benefit are obligations of Summit Holdings and Summit Inc., respectively and are thus excluded from Summit LLC's consolidated net income.\nCost of Revenue (excluding items shown separately)\n\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA are not U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nOn February 28, 2019, Summit LLC entered into Incremental Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, increased the total amount available under the revolving credit facility to $345.0 million and extended the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to February 2024.\nNet revenue in the West segment increased $125.2 million in the year ended January 2, 2021, due to increases in net revenues in all lines of business. Organic aggregate volumes increased 4.4% in 2020 as compared to 2019, and organic aggregates average sales prices increased 1.8%, primarily due to product mix. Organic ready-mix concrete volumes increased 3.0% and our organic ready-mix concrete average sales prices increased 4.7%.\nWe are party to certain legal actions arising from the ordinary course of business activities. Accruals are recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management expects that the ultimate resolution of all current pending or threatened claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
