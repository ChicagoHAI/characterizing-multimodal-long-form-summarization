Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGENERAL\nGuaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc. (the Company\u201d) is a Delaware corporation organized on December 30, 1997 that operates as a one-bank holding company. Guaranty Bank (the Bank\u201d) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nThe primary activity of the Company is to oversee its investment in the Bank. The Company engages in few other activities, and the Company has no significant assets other than its investment in the Bank. For this reason, unless otherwise specified, references to the Company include the operations of the Bank. The Company's principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using such deposits to originate multi-family, construction, agriculture, hospitality, Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) and commercial real estate loans, mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residences, and consumer and business loans. The Company also uses these funds to purchase government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, US government and agency obligations, and other permissible securities. When cash outflows exceed inflows, the Company uses borrowings and brokered deposits as additional financing sources.\nThe Company derives revenues principally from interest earned on loans and investments and, to a lesser extent, from fees charged for services. General economic conditions and policies of the financial institution regulatory agencies, including the MDF and the FDIC, significantly influence the Company's operations. Interest rates on competing investments and general market interest rates influence the Company's cost of funds. Lending activities are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered. The Company intends to focus on commercial, one- to four-family residential and consumer lending throughout southwestern Missouri.\nThe Company acquired Carthage, Missouri-based Hometown Bancshares, Inc. ( Hometown\u201d) including its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Hometown Bank, National Association and Hometown Bancshares Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust on April 2, 2018. Hometown's subsidiary bank, Hometown Bank, National Association, was merged into Guaranty Bank on June 8, 2018. Including the effects of acquisition method accounting adjustments, the Company acquired approximately $178.8 million in assets, including approximately $143.9 million in loans (inclusive of loan discounts) and approximately $161.2 million in deposits. Goodwill of $1.4 million was also recorded as a result of this transaction. The acquisition strengthened the Company's position in Southwest Missouri and the Company believes it will be able to achieve cost savings by integrating the two companies and combining accounting, data processing and other administrative functions all of which gave rise to the goodwill recorded. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe Company has three active wholly-owned subsidiaries other than the Bank, its principal subsidiary: (i) Guaranty Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust; (ii) Guaranty Statutory Trust II, a Delaware statutory trust; and (iii) Hometown Bancshares Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust and a fourth inactive subsidiary. The Guaranty Trusts were formed in December 2005. The Hometown Bancshares Trust was formed on October 29, 2002 and assumed by the Company on April 2, 2018. The exclusive purpose of each Trust was issuing trust preferred securities to acquire junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. The Company's banking operation conducted through the Bank is the Company's only reportable segment. See also the discussion contained in the section captioned Segment Information\u201d in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. The fourth subsidiary is a service corporation which has been inactive since February 1, 2003.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe Company may from time to time make written or oral \"forward-looking statements\", including statements contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits thereto), in its reports to stockholders and in other communications by the Company, which are made in good faith by the Company pursuant to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company cautions that the listed factors are not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the Company's total assets increased $170,678,350 (21%) to $965,137,870, liabilities increased $165,091,251 (23%) to $884,659,278, and stockholders' equity increased $5,587,099 (7%) to $80,478,592. The ratio of stockholders' equity to total assets was 8.3% and 9.4% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, available-for-sale securities increased $5,037,524 (6%), primarily due to $7,520,849 of securities acquired in the Hometown acquisition. The Company purchased $26,151,079 of investments while having sales and principal payments received of $26,965,492. The Company had net unrealized losses of $1,836,406 at December 31, 2018 compared to $844,379 at December 31, 2017.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, net loans receivable increased by $148,693,597 (24%) to $778,298,606. The addition of $143,918,642 in loans at fair value from the Hometown acquisition along with continued production in the multi-family, agriculture, hospitality and Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) lending were the primary drivers for growth in 2018. During the year, commercial real estate loans increased $61,055,038 (23%), permanent 1-4 family loans increased $26,110,020 (25%), commercial loans increased $24,846,644 (26%), construction loans increased $23,810,413 (37%), and consumer and other loans increased $8,374,570 (34%). The Company continues to focus its lending efforts in the commercial, owner occupied real estate and small business lending categories.\nAs of December 31, 2018, management identified loans totaling $20,552,000 as impaired with a related allowance for loan losses of $1,612,000. Impaired loans increased by $9,725,000 during 2018, compared to the balance of $10,827,000 at December 31, 2017.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses increased $888,151 to $7,995,569. In addition to the provision for loan losses of $1,225,000 recorded by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2018, loan charge-offs of specific loans (previously classified as nonperforming) exceeded recoveries by $336,849 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the allowance is primarily due to the increased loan balances during 2018 and reserves on a few specific problem credits. The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of gross loans outstanding (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 1.02% and 1.12%, respectively. The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of nonperforming loans outstanding, as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 61.1% and 71.3%, respectively. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a level to be sufficient in providing for potential loan losses in the Bank's existing loan portfolio.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for acquisition accounting, the loans acquired through the Hometown acquisition were recorded at fair value; therefore, there was no allowance associated with these loans. Management continues to evaluate the allowance need on the acquired loans factoring in the net remaining discount of $2.45 million at December 31, 2018.\nGoodwill increased $1,434,982 (100%) and core deposit intangible increased $2,980,910 (100%) as of December 31, 2018. The increases are due to the Hometown acquisition and are further discussed in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, deposits increased $142,254,472 (23%) to $749,618,822. Deposit balances totaling $161,248,424 (at fair value) were added as a result of the Hometown acquisition. Excluding the acquired balances, checking and savings transaction balances decreased by $40,855,842 and certificates of deposit increased $22,077,932. The decline in transaction balances were primarily a result of a decrease of $34,591,000 in one brokered money market relationship and various declines in accounts acquired by Hometown. Overall, brokered deposits decreased $18,173,000 during 2018. The Company utilizes brokered certificates of deposit as a tool to manage cost of funds and to efficiently match changes in liquidity needs based on loan growth.\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances increased $11,000,000 (12%) from $94,300,000 as of December 31, 2017 to $105,300,000 as of December 31, 2018 due to increased borrowings to fund growth.\nNote payable to bank increased $5,000,000 (100%) when compared to December 31, 2017 due to the Company borrowing $5,000,000 from another financial institution. The funds were used to provide additional capital for funding Bank asset growth. The note carries a variable interest rate tied to three-month LIBOR and matures on June 28, 2020.\nSubordinated debentures increased $6,295,829 (41%) from $15,465,000 to $21,760,829 as of December 31, 2018. The increase is due to the assumption of Hometown Bancshares Statutory Trust I as part of the Hometown acquisition.\nPremises and equipment increased $9,488,067 (89%) from $10,607,094 to $20,095,161 as of December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to the Hometown acquisition.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, stockholders' equity (including unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale securities, net of tax) increased $5,587,099 (7%) to $80,478,592. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 exceeded dividends paid or declared by $5,150,378. The equity portion of the Company's unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and effects of interest rate swaps decreased by $246,563 during 2018. On a per common share basis, stockholders' equity increased from $17.10 as of December 31, 2017 to $18.18 as of December 31, 2018.\nAVERAGE BALANCES, INTEREST AND AVERAGE YIELDS\nThe following table shows the balances as of December 31, 2018 of various categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding yields and costs, and, for the periods indicated: (1) the average balances of various categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, (2) the total interest earned or paid thereon, and (3) the resulting weighted average yields and costs. In addition, the table shows the Company's rate spreads and net yields. Average balances are based on daily balances. Tax-free income is not material; accordingly, interest income and related average yields have not been calculated on a tax equivalent basis. Average loan balances include non-accrual loans. Dollar amounts are expressed in thousands.\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td>

interest rates that are largely a function of the general level of interest rates. The above table sets forth the weekly average interest rates for the 52 weeks ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 as reported by the Federal Reserve. The Bank typically indexes its adjustable rate commercial loans to prime and its adjustable rate mortgage loans to the one-year Treasury Rate. The ten-year Treasury Rate is a proxy for 30-year fixed rate home mortgage loans.\nRates trended upward during 2018 as the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) increased the discount rate by 25 basis points in March, June, September and December 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the prime rate was 5.50% which is a 100 basis point increase from December 31, 2017.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $13,804,971 (47%). The increase is primarily driven by the addition of earning assets as a result of the Hometown acquisition. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $174,348,000 (25%), while the yield on average interest earning assets increased 74 basis points to 4.88%.\nInterest income on loans increased $13,432,168 (49%). The increase is primarily due to higher loan balances, loan offering rates and $3,664,491 in loan accretion recognized on loans acquired from Hometown compared to none in 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had $4,895,000 of unexpected full payoffs of certain purchased credit impaired loans and recognized $1,780,000 of yield accretion due to these payoffs. The average loan receivable balance increased $171,442,000 (28%) while the average yield increased 73 basis points to 5.24%. The Company experienced strong loan activity during 2018. However, pricing on loans is challenging due to significant competition on new and renewing credits.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $3,841,065 (63%). The increase is primarily driven by addition of interest-bearing deposits as a result of the Hometown acquisition. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $155,580,000 (26%), while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 30 basis points to 1.30%.\nInterest expense on deposits increased $3,271,721 (87%) during 2018 as the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased $159,903,000 (32%), while the average interest rate paid to depositors increased 32 basis points to 1.07%. The increase in asset growth opportunities among institutions in our market have created significant competitive pressures on deposit rates. To fund its asset growth going forward, the Company intends to continue to utilize a cost-effective mix of retail and commercial core deposits along with non-core, wholesale funding.\nNet Interest Income. The Company's net interest income increased $9,963,906 (43%) primarily due to the increase in overall average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Refer to the tables in the Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields\u201d section (pages 47 and 48) for additional information on components of net interest income.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged or credited to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered adequate by the Company to provide for potential loan losses in the existing loan portfolio. When making its assessment, the Company considers prior loss experience, volume and type of lending, local banking trends and impaired and past due loans in the Company's loan portfolio. In addition, the Company considers general economic conditions and other factors related to collectability of the Company's loan portfolio.\nBased on its internal analysis and methodology, management recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,225,000 and $1,750,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's increase in the provision was primarily due to the increased loan balances and maintaining general portfolio reserves at a level deemed appropriate in accordance with its methodology. The Bank will continue to monitor its allowance for loan losses and make future additions based on economic and regulatory conditions. Management may need to increase the allowance for loan losses through charges to the provision for loan losses if anticipated growth in the Bank's loan portfolio increases or other circumstances warrant. See further discussions of the allowance for loan losses under Financial Condition\u201d above.\nAlthough the Bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level which it considers to be sufficient to provide for potential loan losses in its existing loan portfolio, there can be no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed internal estimates. In addition, the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by regulatory agencies which can order the establishment of additional loan loss provisions.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $824,620 (14%) due to a few significant factors.\nThe Company recognized an increase in service charge income of $814,950 (69%) and debit card interchange income of $285,753 (35%) primarily due to the Hometown acquisition. Also, the Company continued its emphasis on SBA lending that increased gains on the sale of SBA loans by $84,002 (11%).\nThe increase in income above was offset by increased losses on foreclosed assets of $542,896 (298%) compared to 2017. The Company recognized write-downs of foreclosed assets held for sale, including two properties acquired through the acquisition of Hometown. The re-measurements and write-downs were due to a lack of sales activity, further review of surrounding property values and reductions in the property's listing price (in most cases).\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $9,855,247 (50%) due to a few significant factors.\nOne-time merger expense related to the Hometown acquisition totaled $3,520,727. The costs relate to legal, accounting and investment advisory fees, as well as the cost incurred for termination of a specific vendor core processing contract of approximately $2 million.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $2,878,168 (24%) which was primarily due to the addition of Hometown employees and our continued expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market and increases in other key areas of commercial banking, operations and technology.\nThe Company's occupancy expense increased $1,866,791 (85%) primarily due to the Company's continued enhancements in facilities (including signage) and significant investments in new technologies. A full year of occupancy expense on our new headquarter facility and the ongoing expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market has also played a significant factor in the increase in expense.\nAmortization expense of the core deposit intangible from the Hometown acquisition was $408,571 for 2018. There was no amortization during 2017.\nProfessional service expenses increased $282,581 (52%), primarily due to the Company meeting thresholds to be considered an accelerated filer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which comes with increased auditor attestation requirements on the Company's internal controls.\nThe increases above were partially offset by the elimination of impairment charges on solar credit investments incurred during 2017, which totaled $440,571.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased $715,936 (28%) over 2017 which is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) signed into law on December 22, 2017. As a result of the Act, in 2017, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates, which resulted in a one-time charge to income tax expense of approximately $1.0 million. In 2018, the Company's federal tax rate was reduced from 34% to 21% as a result of the Act.\nCash Dividends Paid. The Company paid dividends of $0.12 per share on April 19, 2018 to stockholders of record as of April 9, 2018, $0.12 per share on July 19, 2018, to stockholders of record as of July 9, 2018, and $.12 per share on October 19, 2018, to stockholders of record as of October 9, 2018. The Company also declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per share on December 21, 2018, which was paid on January 14, 2019, to stockholders of record on January 4, 2019. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company paid $2,132,221, $1,767,486 and $1,415,180 in dividends on common stock.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016\nInterest Rates\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average for the Year Shown\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Prime\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Ten-Year\nTreasury\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One-Year\nTreasury\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.51 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank charges borrowers and pays depositors interest rates that are largely a function of the general level of interest rates. The above table sets forth the weekly average interest rates for the 52 weeks ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 as reported by the Federal Reserve. The Bank typically indexes its adjustable rate commercial loans to prime and its adjustable rate mortgage loans to the one-year Treasury Rate. The ten-year Treasury Rate is a proxy for 30-year fixed rate home mortgage loans.\nRates trended upward during 2017 as the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) increased the discount rate by 25 basis points in March, June and December 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the prime rate was 4.5% which is a 75 basis point increase from December 31, 2016.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $4,051,407 (16%). The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $78,175,000 (12%), while the yield on average interest earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.14%.\nInterest income on loans increased $4,139,313 (18%). The average loan receivable balance increased $94,444,000 (18%) while the average yield decreased 3 basis points to 4.51%. The Company experienced strong loan activity during 2017. However, pricing on loans is challenging due to significant competition on new and renewing credits. The pricing pressure has impacted the ability to maintain loan yield compared to 2016.\nInterest income on investment securities decreased $103,474 (5%). The average balance of investment securities decreased $13,692,000 (14%) while the average yield improved 18 basis points to 2.05%.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $1,909,542 (46%) as the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $61,089,000 (11%), while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 24 basis points to 1.00%.\nInterest expense on deposits increased $1,467,583 (64%) during 2017 as the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased $38,148,000 (8%), while the average interest rate paid to depositors increased 25 basis points to 0.75%. The increase in asset growth opportunities among institutions in our market have created significant competitive pressures on deposit rates\nNet Interest Income. The Company's net interest income increased $2,141,865 (10%) primarily due to the increase in overall average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Refer to the tables in the Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields\u201d section (pages 47 and 48) for additional information on components of net interest income.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged or credited to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered adequate by the Company to provide for potential loan losses in the existing loan portfolio. When making its assessment, the Company considers prior loss experience, volume and type of lending, local banking trends and impaired and past due loans in the Company's loan portfolio. In addition, the Company considers general economic conditions and other factors related to collectability of the Company's loan portfolio.\nBased on its internal analysis and methodology, management recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,750,000 and $1,375,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company's increase in the provision was primarily due to the increased loan balances and maintaining general portfolio reserves at a level deemed appropriate in accordance with its methodology.\nAlthough the Bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level which it considers to be sufficient to provide for potential loan losses in its existing loan portfolio. In addition, the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by regulatory agencies which can order the establishment of additional loan loss provisions.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $857,113 (18%). This was primarily due to the Company's emphasis on Small Business Administration (SBA) lending and its continued efforts in fixed-rate mortgage lending. The Company's gains on sale of SBA loans increased $449,177, gains on fixed-rate mortgage loans sales increased $312,730 and net gain on foreclosed assets increased $180,734 when compared to 2016. These gains were partially offset by a decrease in gain on sale of investment securities of $146,208 when compared to 2016.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $2,502,340 (15%). Salaries and employee benefits increased $1,353,964 (13%) which was primarily due to the expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market and increases in other key areas of commercial banking, operations and technology. Included in the salaries and benefits increase, the Company had $780,363 of increases in health/retirement benefits and performance incentives due to strong Company results.\nThe Company incurred $587,428 (100%) of impairment charges on solar tax credit investments in 2017. The Company purchased an interest in a utility scale solar energy project. The project was expected to generate an estimated $557,000 of 2017 investment tax credits plus additional tax credits in future years assuming certain compliance criteria are met. The cost of the investment will be accounted for under the equity and hypothetical liquidation at book value methods. Under these methods, an impairment charge is recorded on the investment equal to the discounted future cash flows compared to the carrying value of the investment.\nThe Company's occupancy expense increased $377,199 (21%) primarily due to the Company's continued enhancements in facilities (including signage) and significant investments in new technologies. The continued expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market has also played a factor in the increase in expense.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes that increased $557,985 (28%) over 2016 was primarily a result of the Company's $1.0 million charge for the deferred tax asset write-down which was partially offset by the utilization of tax credits which is discussed above. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates. As of December 31, 2017, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset and it resulted in a one-time charge to income tax expense of approximately $1.0 million.\nCash Dividends Paid. The Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share on April 14, 2017 to stockholders of record as of April 4, 2017, and $0.10 per share on July 13, 2017, to stockholders of record as of July 3, 2017, and $.10 per share on October 13, 2017, to stockholders of record as of October 3, 2017 and also declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share on December 22, 2017, which was paid on January 13, 2018, to stockholders of record on January 3, 2018. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid $1,767,486, $1,415,180 and $873,499 in dividends on common stock.\nLIQUIDITY\nLiquidity refers to the ability to manage future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and fund operations. Maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity allows the Company to have sufficient funds available for customer demand for loans, withdrawal of deposit balances and maturities of deposits and other liabilities. The Company's primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, customer deposits and FHLB borrowings. The Company also has established a borrowing line with the Federal Reserve Bank which is considered a secondary source of funds.\nThe Company's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, and certificates of deposit with other financial institutions that have an original maturity of three months or less. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank's operating, financing, and investment activities at any given time. The Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $34,121,642 as of December 31, 2018 and $37,406,930 as of December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $3,285,288. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows, which are subject to, and influenced by, many factors. The Bank has $153,851,915 in certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in one year or less. Management anticipates that the majority of these certificates will renew in the normal course of operations. Based on existing collateral as well as the FHLB's limitation of advances to 35% of assets, the Bank has the ability to borrow an additional $120,599,000 from the FHLB, as of December 31, 2018. Based on existing collateral, the Bank has the ability to borrow $53,700,000 from the Federal Reserve Bank as of December 31, 2018. The Bank plans to maintain its FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings to a level that will provide a borrowing capacity sufficient to provide for contingencies. Management has many policies and controls in place to attempt to manage the appropriate level of liquidity.\nCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company meets the eligibility criteria of a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement issued in February 2015, and is no longer obligated to report consolidated regulatory capital. The Bank continues to be subject to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. The Bank's capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that revised its risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations to align them with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act ( Basel III Rule\u201d). The Basel III Rule implemented a revised definition of regulatory capital, a new common equity tier 1 ( CET1\u201d) minimum capital requirement, and a higher minimum tier1 capital requirement. The final rules also made changes to the prompt corrective action framework for depository institutions by incorporating the new minimum capital ratios into the framework, introducing the CET1 capital measure, and aligning the definition of tangible equity for purposes of the critically undercapitalized prompt corrective action category with the definition of tier 1 capital. Under the Basel III Rule, the following three components comprise a banking organization's regulatory capital\u201d: (i) CET1 capital,\u201d which is predominantly comprised of retained earnings and common stock instruments that meet certain criteria and related surplus (net of any treasury stock), AOCI (for organizations that do not make opt-out elections), and CET1 minority interest, which are subject to certain restrictions; (ii) Additional Tier 1 Capital,\u201d which consists of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and similar instruments meeting specified eligibility criteria and related surplus, Tier 1 minority interests not included in CET1 capital, and TARP\u201d preferred stock and other instruments issued under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008; and (iii) Tier 2 Capital,\u201d which includes instruments such as subordinated debt that has a minimum original maturity of at least five years and is subordinated to the claims of depositors and general creditors, total capital minority interest not included in Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of a banking organization's allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL), less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions.\nEffective January 1, 2015, the final rule requires the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the prior requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets (unchanged from the prior requirement). When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Rule will require the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% \"capital conservation buffer\" effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation); (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.\nBeginning January 1, 2016, the capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.\nThe Bank is classified as well capitalized\u201d under current regulatory guidelines. See also additional information provided under the caption Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The proposed CBLR rule issued on February 8, 2019 by federal banking regulators may change how the Bank is classified. At this point, it is unclear whether federal banking regulators will issue a final rule and, even if they do, the final rule may not provide relief from federal banking capital requirements.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nVarious commitments and contingent liabilities arise in the normal course of business, which are not required to be recorded on the balance sheet. The most significant of these are loan commitments, lines of credit and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans of approximately $5,600,000 and $7,261,000, respectively. Lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, unused lines of credit to borrowers aggregated approximately $104,570,000 and $117,068,000, respectively, for commercial lines and $22,254,000 and $15,929,000, respectively, for open-end consumer lines. Since a portion of the loan commitment and line of credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total unused commitments and lines do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nStandby letters of credit are irrevocable conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Bank had total outstanding standby letters of credit amounting to $12,218,000 and $12,733,000 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The commitments extend over varying periods of time.\nIn connection with the Company's issuance and acquisition of the Trust Preferred Securities and pursuant to three guarantee agreements by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, the Company issued a limited, irrevocable guarantee of the obligations of each Trust under the Trust Preferred Securities whereby the Company has guaranteed any and all payment obligations of the Trusts related to the Trust Preferred Securities including distributions on, and the liquidation or redemption price of, the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent each Trust does not have funds available.\nAGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes the Company's fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date as of December 31, 2018.

As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In the current interest rate environment, liquidity and the maturity structure of the Bank's assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments.\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. If actual results are different than management's judgments and estimates, the Company's financial results could change, and such change could be material to the Company.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of loans acquired with the possibility of impairment and the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans and fair values. In connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of foreclosed assets held for sale, management obtains independent appraisals for significant properties.\nGoodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to periodic impairment testing. This testing is to be performed annually, or more frequently if events occur that lead to the possibility that the valuation of such assets could be considered unrecoverable.\nThe Company has identified the accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses, goodwill and intangible assets, related significant estimates and judgments as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these significant estimates and judgments and our accounting policies, also see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in this report.", "item_7_truncated": "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments.\nThe Company cautions that the listed factors are not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.\nGENERAL\nTable 104: <table> <tr>

The increase in asset growth opportunities among institutions in our market have created significant competitive pressures on deposit rates.

The increase is primarily due to higher loan balances, loan offering rates and $3,664,491 in loan accretion recognized on loans acquired from Hometown compared to none in 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had $4,895,000 of unexpected full payoffs of certain purchased credit impaired loans and recognized $1,780,000 of yield accretion due to these payoffs. The average loan receivable balance increased $171,442,000 (28%) while the average yield increased 73 basis points to 5.24%. The Company experienced strong loan activity during 2018. However, pricing on loans is challenging due to significant competition on new and renewing credits.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One to\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three to\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Five Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Five Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits without stated maturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>517,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>517,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time and brokered certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB and Federal Reserve advances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debentures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,761 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,573 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long term obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>894,541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>780,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in income above was offset by increased losses on foreclosed assets of $542,896 (298%) compared to 2017.

The re-measurements and write-downs were due to a lack of sales activity, further review of surrounding property values and reductions in the property's listing price (in most cases).\nTable 103:

December 31, 2018, the Company's total assets increased $170,678,350 (21%) to $965,137,870, liabilities increased $165,091,251 (23%) to $884,659,278, and stockholders' equity increased $5,587,099 (7%) to $80,478,592. The ratio of stockholders' equity to total assets was 8.3% and 9.4% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company derives revenues principally from interest earned on loans and investments and, to a lesser extent, from fees charged for services. General economic conditions and policies of the financial institution regulatory agencies, including the MDF and the FDIC, significantly influence the Company's operations. Interest rates on competing investments and general market interest rates influence the Company's cost of funds. Lending activities are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered. The Company intends to focus on commercial, one- to four-family residential and consumer lending throughout southwestern Missouri.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses increased $888,151 to $7,995,569. In addition to the provision for loan losses of $1,225,000 recorded by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2018, loan charge-offs of specific loans (previously classified as nonperforming) exceeded recoveries by $336,849 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the allowance is primarily due to the increased loan balances during 2018 and reserves on a few specific problem credits. The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of gross loans outstanding (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 1.02% and 1.12%, respectively. The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of nonperforming loans outstanding, as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 61.1% and 71.3%, respectively. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a level to be sufficient in providing for potential loan losses in the Bank's existing loan portfolio.\nProfessional service expenses increased $282,581 (52%), primarily due to the Company meeting thresholds to be considered an accelerated filer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which comes with increased auditor attestation requirements on the Company's internal controls.\nAlthough the Bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level which it considers to be sufficient to provide for potential loan losses in its existing loan portfolio, there can be no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed internal estimates. In addition, the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by regulatory agencies which can order the establishment of additional loan loss provisions.\nLIQUIDITY\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, stockholders' equity (including unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale securities, net of tax) increased $5,587,099 (7%) to $80,478,592. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 exceeded dividends paid or declared by $5,150,378. The equity portion of the Company's unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and effects of interest rate swaps decreased by $246,563 during 2018. On a per common share basis, stockholders' equity increased from $17.10 as of December 31, 2017 to $18.18 as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Bank is classified as well capitalized\u201d under current regulatory guidelines. See also additional information provided under the caption Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The proposed CBLR rule issued on February 8, 2019 by federal banking regulators may change how the Bank is classified. At this point, it is unclear whether federal banking regulators will issue a final rule and, even if they do, the final rule may not provide relief from federal banking capital requirements.\nCash Dividends Paid. The Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share on April 14, 2017 to stockholders of record as of April 4, 2017, and $0.10 per share on July 13, 2017, to stockholders of record as of July 3, 2017, and $.10 per share on October 13, 2017, to stockholders of record as of October 3, 2017 and also declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share on December 22, 2017, which was paid on January 13, 2018, to stockholders of record on January 3, 2018. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid $1,767,486, $1,415,180 and $873,499 in dividends on common stock.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPremises and equipment increased $9,488,067 (89%) from $10,607,094 to $20,095,161 as of December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to the Hometown acquisition.\nInterest expense on deposits increased $1,467,583 (64%) during 2017 as the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased $38,148,000 (8%), while the average interest rate paid to depositors increased 25 basis points to 0.75%. The increase in asset growth opportunities among institutions in our market have created significant competitive pressures on deposit rates\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $824,620 (14%) due to a few significant factors.\n\nLiquidity refers to the ability to manage future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and fund operations. Maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity allows the Company to have sufficient funds available for customer demand for loans, withdrawal of deposit balances and maturities of deposits and other liabilities. The Company's primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, customer deposits and FHLB borrowings. The Company also has established a borrowing line with the Federal Reserve Bank which is considered a secondary source of funds.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $3,841,065 (63%). The increase is primarily driven by addition of interest-bearing deposits as a result of the Hometown acquisition. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $155,580,000 (26%), while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 30 basis points to 1.30%.\nThe increases above were partially offset by the elimination of impairment charges on solar credit investments incurred during 2017, which totaled $440,571.\nSubordinated debentures increased $6,295,829 (41%) from $15,465,000 to $21,760,829 as of December 31, 2018. The increase is due to the assumption of Hometown Bancshares Statutory Trust I as part of the Hometown acquisition.\nVarious commitments and contingent liabilities arise in the normal course of business, which are not required to be recorded on the balance sheet. The most significant of these are loan commitments, lines of credit and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans of approximately $5,600,000 and $7,261,000, respectively. Lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, unused lines of credit to borrowers aggregated approximately $104,570,000 and $117,068,000, respectively, for commercial lines and $22,254,000 and $15,929,000, respectively, for open-end consumer lines. Since a portion of the loan commitment and line of credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total unused commitments and lines do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged or credited to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered adequate by the Company to provide for potential loan losses in the existing loan portfolio. When making its assessment, the Company considers prior loss experience, volume and type of lending, local banking trends and impaired and past due loans in the Company's loan portfolio. In addition, the Company considers general economic conditions and other factors related to collectability of the Company's loan portfolio.\nBased on its internal analysis and methodology, management recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,225,000 and $1,750,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's increase in the provision was primarily due to the increased loan balances and maintaining general portfolio reserves at a level deemed appropriate in accordance with its methodology. The Bank will continue to monitor its allowance for loan losses and make future additions based on economic and regulatory conditions. Management may need to increase the allowance for loan losses through charges to the provision for loan losses if anticipated growth in the Bank's loan portfolio increases or other circumstances warrant. See further discussions of the allowance for loan losses under Financial Condition\u201d above.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, net loans receivable increased by $148,693,597 (24%) to $778,298,606. The addition of $143,918,642 in loans at fair value from the Hometown acquisition along with continued production in the multi-family, agriculture, hospitality and Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) lending were the primary drivers for growth in 2018. During the year, commercial real estate loans increased $61,055,038 (23%), permanent 1-4 family loans increased $26,110,020 (25%), commercial loans increased $24,846,644 (26%), construction loans increased $23,810,413 (37%), and consumer and other loans increased $8,374,570 (34%). The Company continues to focus its lending efforts in the commercial, owner occupied real estate and small business lending categories.\nThe Bank charges borrowers and pays depositors interest rates that are largely a function of the general level of interest rates. The above table sets forth the weekly average interest rates for the 52 weeks ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 as reported by the Federal Reserve. The Bank typically indexes its adjustable rate commercial loans to prime and its adjustable rate mortgage loans to the one-year Treasury Rate. The ten-year Treasury Rate is a proxy for 30-year fixed rate home mortgage loans.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $2,502,340 (15%). Salaries and employee benefits increased $1,353,964 (13%) which was primarily due to the expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market and increases in other key areas of commercial banking, operations and technology. Included in the salaries and benefits increase, the Company had $780,363 of increases in health/retirement benefits and performance incentives due to strong Company results.\nOne-time merger expense related to the Hometown acquisition totaled $3,520,727. The costs relate to legal, accounting and investment advisory fees, as well as the cost incurred for termination of a specific vendor core processing contract of approximately $2 million.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND DECEMBER 31, 2017\nThe primary activity of the Company is to oversee its investment in the Bank. The Company engages in few other activities, and the Company has no significant assets other than its investment in the Bank. For this reason, unless otherwise specified, references to the Company include the operations of the Bank. The Company's principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using such deposits to originate multi-family, construction, agriculture, hospitality, Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) and commercial real estate loans, mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residences, and consumer and business loans. The Company also uses these funds to purchase government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, US government and agency obligations, and other permissible securities. When cash outflows exceed inflows, the Company uses borrowings and brokered deposits as additional financing sources.\nGoodwill increased $1,434,982 (100%) and core deposit intangible increased $2,980,910 (100%) as of December 31, 2018. The increases are due to the Hometown acquisition and are further discussed in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company recognized an increase in service charge income of $814,950 (69%) and debit card interchange income of $285,753 (35%) primarily due to the Hometown acquisition. Also, the Company continued its emphasis on SBA lending that increased gains on the sale of SBA loans by $84,002 (11%).\nIn connection with the Company's issuance and acquisition of the Trust Preferred Securities and pursuant to three guarantee agreements by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, the Company issued a limited, irrevocable guarantee of the obligations of each Trust under the Trust Preferred Securities whereby the Company has guaranteed any and all payment obligations of the Trusts related to the Trust Preferred Securities including distributions on, and the liquidation or redemption price of, the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent each Trust does not have funds available.\nThe Company prepared the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $857,113 (18%). This was primarily due to the Company's emphasis on Small Business Administration (SBA) lending and its continued efforts in fixed-rate mortgage lending. The Company's gains on sale of SBA loans increased $449,177, gains on fixed-rate mortgage loans sales increased $312,730 and net gain on foreclosed assets increased $180,734 when compared to 2016. These gains were partially offset by a decrease in gain on sale of investment securities of $146,208 when compared to 2016.\nThe Company meets the eligibility criteria of a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement issued in February 2015, and is no longer obligated to report consolidated regulatory capital. The Bank continues to be subject to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. The Bank's capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nRates trended upward during 2018 as the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) increased the discount rate by 25 basis points in March, June, September and December 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the prime rate was 5.50% which is a 100 basis point increase from December 31, 2017.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $4,051,407 (16%). The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $78,175,000 (12%), while the yield on average interest earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.14%.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nStandby letters of credit are irrevocable conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Bank had total outstanding standby letters of credit amounting to $12,218,000 and $12,733,000 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The commitments extend over varying periods of time.\nAs of December 31, 2018, management identified loans totaling $20,552,000 as impaired with a related allowance for loan losses of $1,612,000. Impaired loans increased by $9,725,000 during 2018, compared to the balance of $10,827,000 at December 31, 2017.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for acquisition accounting, the loans acquired through the Hometown acquisition were recorded at fair value; therefore, there was no allowance associated with these loans. Management continues to evaluate the allowance need on the acquired loans factoring in the net remaining discount of $2.45 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe Company may from time to time make written or oral \"forward-looking statements\", including statements contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits thereto), in its reports to stockholders and in other communications by the Company, which are made in good faith by the Company pursuant to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, words such as anticipates,\u201d estimates,\u201d believes,\u201d expects,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.\nAVERAGE BALANCES, INTEREST AND AVERAGE YIELDS\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $1,909,542 (46%) as the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $61,089,000 (11%), while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 24 basis points to 1.00%.\n\nAmortization expense of the core deposit intangible from the Hometown acquisition was $408,571 for 2018. There was no amortization during 2017.\nBased on its internal analysis and methodology, management recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,750,000 and $1,375,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company's increase in the provision was primarily due to the increased loan balances and maintaining general portfolio reserves at a level deemed appropriate in accordance with its methodology.\nCash Dividends Paid. The Company paid dividends of $0.12 per share on April 19, 2018 to stockholders of record as of April 9, 2018, $0.12 per share on July 19, 2018, to stockholders of record as of July 9, 2018, and $.12 per share on October 19, 2018, to stockholders of record as of October 9, 2018. The Company also declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per share on December 21, 2018, which was paid on January 14, 2019, to stockholders of record on January 4, 2019. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company paid $2,132,221, $1,767,486 and $1,415,180 in dividends on common stock.\nGuaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc. (the Company\u201d) is a Delaware corporation organized on December 30, 1997 that operates as a one-bank holding company. Guaranty Bank (the Bank\u201d) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nThe Company's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, and certificates of deposit with other financial institutions that have an original maturity of three months or less. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank's operating, financing, and investment activities at any given time. The Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $34,121,642 as of December 31, 2018 and $37,406,930 as of December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $3,285,288. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows, which are subject to, and influenced by, many factors. The Bank has $153,851,915 in certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in one year or less. Management anticipates that the majority of these certificates will renew in the normal course of operations. Based on existing collateral as well as the FHLB's limitation of advances to 35% of assets, the Bank has the ability to borrow an additional $120,599,000 from the FHLB, as of December 31, 2018. Based on existing collateral, the Bank has the ability to borrow $53,700,000 from the Federal Reserve Bank as of December 31, 2018. The Bank plans to maintain its FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings to a level that will provide a borrowing capacity sufficient to provide for contingencies. Management has many policies and controls in place to attempt to manage the appropriate level of liquidity.\nThe Bank charges borrowers and pays depositors interest rates that are largely a function of the general level of interest rates. The above table sets forth the weekly average interest rates for the 52 weeks ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 as reported by the Federal Reserve. The Bank typically indexes its adjustable rate commercial loans to prime and its adjustable rate mortgage loans to the one-year Treasury Rate. The ten-year Treasury Rate is a proxy for 30-year fixed rate home mortgage loans.\nNet Interest Income. The Company's net interest income increased $2,141,865 (10%) primarily due to the increase in overall average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Refer to the tables in the Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields\u201d section (pages 47 and 48) for additional information on components of net interest income.\nNote payable to bank increased $5,000,000 (100%) when compared to December 31, 2017 due to the Company borrowing $5,000,000 from another financial institution. The funds were used to provide additional capital for funding Bank asset growth. The note carries a variable interest rate tied to three-month LIBOR and matures on June 28, 2020.\nUnlike most companies, the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In the current interest rate environment, liquidity and the maturity structure of the Bank's assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, deposits increased $142,254,472 (23%) to $749,618,822. Deposit balances totaling $161,248,424 (at fair value) were added as a result of the Hometown acquisition. Excluding the acquired balances, checking and savings transaction balances decreased by $40,855,842 and certificates of deposit increased $22,077,932. The decline in transaction balances were primarily a result of a decrease of $34,591,000 in one brokered money market relationship and various declines in accounts acquired by Hometown. Overall, brokered deposits decreased $18,173,000 during 2018. The Company utilizes brokered certificates of deposit as a tool to manage cost of funds and to efficiently match changes in liquidity needs based on loan growth.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that revised its risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations to align them with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act ( Basel III Rule\u201d). The Basel III Rule implemented a revised definition of regulatory capital, a new common equity tier 1 ( CET1\u201d) minimum capital requirement, and a higher minimum tier1 capital requirement. The final rules also made changes to the prompt corrective action framework for depository institutions by incorporating the new minimum capital ratios into the framework, introducing the CET1 capital measure, and aligning the definition of tangible equity for purposes of the critically undercapitalized prompt corrective action category with the definition of tier 1 capital. Under the Basel III Rule, the following three components comprise a banking organization's regulatory capital\u201d: (i) CET1 capital,\u201d which is predominantly comprised of retained earnings and common stock instruments that meet certain criteria and related surplus (net of any treasury stock), AOCI (for organizations that do not make opt-out elections), and CET1 minority interest, which are subject to certain restrictions; (ii) Additional Tier 1 Capital,\u201d which consists of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and similar instruments meeting specified eligibility criteria and related surplus, Tier 1 minority interests not included in CET1 capital, and TARP\u201d preferred stock and other instruments issued under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008; and (iii) Tier 2 Capital,\u201d which includes instruments such as subordinated debt that has a minimum original maturity of at least five years and is subordinated to the claims of depositors and general creditors, total capital minority interest not included in Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of a banking organization's allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL), less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased $715,936 (28%) over 2017 which is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) signed into law on December 22, 2017. As a result of the Act, in 2017, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates, which resulted in a one-time charge to income tax expense of approximately $1.0 million. In 2018, the Company's federal tax rate was reduced from 34% to 21% as a result of the Act.\nThe Company has identified the accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses, goodwill and intangible assets, related significant estimates and judgments as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these significant estimates and judgments and our accounting policies, also see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in this report.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of loans acquired with the possibility of impairment and the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans and fair values. In connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of foreclosed assets held for sale, management obtains independent appraisals for significant properties.\nEffective January 1, 2015, the final rule requires the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the prior requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets (unchanged from the prior requirement). When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Rule will require the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% \"capital conservation buffer\" effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation); (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $9,855,247 (50%) due to a few significant factors.\nBeginning January 1, 2016, the capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.\nThe Company's occupancy expense increased $377,199 (21%) primarily due to the Company's continued enhancements in facilities (including signage) and significant investments in new technologies. The continued expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market has also played a factor in the increase in expense.\nCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe following table sets forth information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated resulting from changes in average balances and average rates shown in the previous table. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities information is provided with respect to changes attributable to: (i) changes in balance (change in balance multiplied by the old rate), (ii) changes in interest rates (change in rate multiplied by the old balance); and (iii) the combined effect of changes in balance and interest rates (change in balance multiplied by change in rate). Dollar amounts are expressed in thousands.\nThe Company's occupancy expense increased $1,866,791 (85%) primarily due to the Company's continued enhancements in facilities (including signage) and significant investments in new technologies. A full year of occupancy expense on our new headquarter facility and the ongoing expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market has also played a significant factor in the increase in expense.\nNet Interest Income. The Company's net interest income increased $9,963,906 (43%) primarily due to the increase in overall average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Refer to the tables in the Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields\u201d section (pages 47 and 48) for additional information on components of net interest income.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $2,878,168 (24%) which was primarily due to the addition of Hometown employees and our continued expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market and increases in other key areas of commercial banking, operations and technology.\nInterest income on loans increased $4,139,313 (18%). The average loan receivable balance increased $94,444,000 (18%) while the average yield decreased 3 basis points to 4.51%. The Company experienced strong loan activity during 2017. However, pricing on loans is challenging due to significant competition on new and renewing credits. The pricing pressure has impacted the ability to maintain loan yield compared to 2016.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes that increased $557,985 (28%) over 2016 was primarily a result of the Company's $1.0 million charge for the deferred tax asset write-down which was partially offset by the utilization of tax credits which is discussed above. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates. As of December 31, 2017, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset and it resulted in a one-time charge to income tax expense of approximately $1.0 million.\nInterest Rates\n\nRates trended upward during 2017 as the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) increased the discount rate by 25 basis points in March, June and December 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the prime rate was 4.5% which is a 75 basis point increase from December 31, 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged or credited to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered adequate by the Company to provide for potential loan losses in the existing loan portfolio. When making its assessment, the Company considers prior loss experience, volume and type of lending, local banking trends and impaired and past due loans in the Company's loan portfolio. In addition, the Company considers general economic conditions and other factors related to collectability of the Company's loan portfolio.\nInterest income on investment securities decreased $103,474 (5%). The average balance of investment securities decreased $13,692,000 (14%) while the average yield improved 18 basis points to 2.05%.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $13,804,971 (47%). The increase is primarily driven by the addition of earning assets as a result of the Hometown acquisition. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $174,348,000 (25%), while the yield on average interest earning assets increased 74 basis points to 4.88%.\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances increased $11,000,000 (12%) from $94,300,000 as of December 31, 2017 to $105,300,000 as of December 31, 2018 due to increased borrowings to fund growth.\nAGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAlthough the Bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level which it considers to be sufficient to provide for potential loan losses in its existing loan portfolio. In addition, the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by regulatory agencies which can order the establishment of additional loan loss provisions.\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. If actual results are different than management's judgments and estimates, the Company's financial results could change, and such change could be material to the Company.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, available-for-sale securities increased $5,037,524 (6%), primarily due to $7,520,849 of securities acquired in the Hometown acquisition. The Company purchased $26,151,079 of investments while having sales and principal payments received of $26,965,492. The Company had net unrealized losses of $1,836,406 at December 31, 2018 compared to $844,379 at December 31, 2017.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nInterest Rates\nThe following table shows the balances as of December 31, 2018 of various categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding yields and costs, and, for the periods indicated: (1) the average balances of various categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, (2) the total interest earned or paid thereon, and (3) the resulting weighted average yields and costs. In addition, the table shows the Company's rate spreads and net yields. Average balances are based on daily balances. Tax-free income is not material; accordingly, interest income and related average yields have not been calculated on a tax equivalent basis. Average loan balances include non-accrual loans. Dollar amounts are expressed in thousands.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of the Company's plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions that are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the Company's control). The following factors, among others, could cause the Company's financial performance to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements: the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the real estate values and the local economies in which the Company conducts operations; risks associated with the completion of the recent acquisition of Hometown and its wholly-owned subsidiary Hometown Bank and the integration of Hometown Bank with the Bank, including the possibility that we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition\u037e future mergers or acquisitions; the impact of recent and potential future changes in the laws, rules, regulations, interpretations and policies relating to financial institutions, accounting, tax, monetary and fiscal matters and their application by our regulators; the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, changes in interest rates; changes in LIBOR; the timely development of and acceptance of new products and services of the company and the perceived overall value of these products and services by users, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors' products and services; the impact of changes in financial services' laws and regulations (including laws concerning taxes, banking, securities and insurance); asset quality deterioration; environmental liability associated with real estate collateral; technological changes and cybersecurity risks; acquisitions; employee retention; the success of the Company at managing the risks resulting from these factors; and other factors set forth in reports and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time. For further information about these and other risks, uncertainties and factors, please review the disclosure included in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company acquired Carthage, Missouri-based Hometown Bancshares, Inc. ( Hometown\u201d) including its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Hometown Bank, National Association and Hometown Bancshares Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust on April 2, 2018. Hometown's subsidiary bank, Hometown Bank, National Association, was merged into Guaranty Bank on June 8, 2018. Including the effects of acquisition method accounting adjustments, the Company acquired approximately $178.8 million in assets, including approximately $143.9 million in loans (inclusive of loan discounts) and approximately $161.2 million in deposits. Goodwill of $1.4 million was also recorded as a result of this transaction. The acquisition strengthened the Company's position in Southwest Missouri and the Company believes it will be able to achieve cost savings by integrating the two companies and combining accounting, data processing and other administrative functions all of which gave rise to the goodwill recorded. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe Company incurred $587,428 (100%) of impairment charges on solar tax credit investments in 2017. The Company purchased an interest in a utility scale solar energy project. The project was expected to generate an estimated $557,000 of 2017 investment tax credits plus additional tax credits in future years assuming certain compliance criteria are met. The cost of the investment will be accounted for under the equity and hypothetical liquidation at book value methods. Under these methods, an impairment charge is recorded on the investment equal to the discounted future cash flows compared to the carrying value of the investment.\nGoodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to periodic impairment testing. This testing is to be performed annually, or more frequently if events occur that lead to the possibility that the valuation of such assets could be considered unrecoverable.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date as of December 31, 2018. Dollar amounts are expressed in thousands.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe Company has three active wholly-owned subsidiaries other than the Bank, its principal subsidiary: (i) Guaranty Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust; (ii) Guaranty Statutory Trust II, a Delaware statutory trust; and (iii) Hometown Bancshares Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust and a fourth inactive subsidiary. The Guaranty Trusts were formed in December 2005. The Hometown Bancshares Trust was formed on October 29, 2002 and assumed by the Company on April 2, 2018. The exclusive purpose of each Trust was issuing trust preferred securities to acquire junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. The Company's banking operation conducted through the Bank is the Company's only reportable segment. See also the discussion contained in the section captioned Segment Information\u201d in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. The fourth subsidiary is a service corporation which has been inactive since February 1, 2003.", "item_7_text": "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments.\nThe Company cautions that the listed factors are not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.\nGENERAL\nInterest expense on deposits increased $3,271,721 (87%) during 2018 as the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased $159,903,000 (32%), while the average interest rate paid to depositors increased 32 basis points to 1.07%. The increase in asset growth opportunities among institutions in our market have created significant competitive pressures on deposit rates. To fund its asset growth going forward, the Company intends to continue to utilize a cost-effective mix of retail and commercial core deposits along with non-core, wholesale funding.\n\nInterest income on loans increased $13,432,168 (49%). The increase is primarily due to higher loan balances, loan offering rates and $3,664,491 in loan accretion recognized on loans acquired from Hometown compared to none in 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had $4,895,000 of unexpected full payoffs of certain purchased credit impaired loans and recognized $1,780,000 of yield accretion due to these payoffs. The average loan receivable balance increased $171,442,000 (28%) while the average yield increased 73 basis points to 5.24%. The Company experienced strong loan activity during 2018. However, pricing on loans is challenging due to significant competition on new and renewing credits.\nThe increase in income above was offset by increased losses on foreclosed assets of $542,896 (298%) compared to 2017. The Company recognized write-downs of foreclosed assets held for sale, including two properties acquired through the acquisition of Hometown. The re-measurements and write-downs were due to a lack of sales activity, further review of surrounding property values and reductions in the property's listing price (in most cases).\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the Company's total assets increased $170,678,350 (21%) to $965,137,870, liabilities increased $165,091,251 (23%) to $884,659,278, and stockholders' equity increased $5,587,099 (7%) to $80,478,592. The ratio of stockholders' equity to total assets was 8.3% and 9.4% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company derives revenues principally from interest earned on loans and investments and, to a lesser extent, from fees charged for services. General economic conditions and policies of the financial institution regulatory agencies, including the MDF and the FDIC, significantly influence the Company's operations. Interest rates on competing investments and general market interest rates influence the Company's cost of funds. Lending activities are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered. The Company intends to focus on commercial, one- to four-family residential and consumer lending throughout southwestern Missouri.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses increased $888,151 to $7,995,569. In addition to the provision for loan losses of $1,225,000 recorded by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2018, loan charge-offs of specific loans (previously classified as nonperforming) exceeded recoveries by $336,849 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the allowance is primarily due to the increased loan balances during 2018 and reserves on a few specific problem credits. The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of gross loans outstanding (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 1.02% and 1.12%, respectively. The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of nonperforming loans outstanding, as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 61.1% and 71.3%, respectively. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a level to be sufficient in providing for potential loan losses in the Bank's existing loan portfolio.\nProfessional service expenses increased $282,581 (52%), primarily due to the Company meeting thresholds to be considered an accelerated filer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which comes with increased auditor attestation requirements on the Company's internal controls.\nAlthough the Bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level which it considers to be sufficient to provide for potential loan losses in its existing loan portfolio, there can be no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed internal estimates. In addition, the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by regulatory agencies which can order the establishment of additional loan loss provisions.\nLIQUIDITY\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, stockholders' equity (including unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale securities, net of tax) increased $5,587,099 (7%) to $80,478,592. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 exceeded dividends paid or declared by $5,150,378. The equity portion of the Company's unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and effects of interest rate swaps decreased by $246,563 during 2018. On a per common share basis, stockholders' equity increased from $17.10 as of December 31, 2017 to $18.18 as of December 31, 2018.\nThe Bank is classified as well capitalized\u201d under current regulatory guidelines. See also additional information provided under the caption Regulatory Matters\u201d in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The proposed CBLR rule issued on February 8, 2019 by federal banking regulators may change how the Bank is classified. At this point, it is unclear whether federal banking regulators will issue a final rule and, even if they do, the final rule may not provide relief from federal banking capital requirements.\nCash Dividends Paid. The Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share on April 14, 2017 to stockholders of record as of April 4, 2017, and $0.10 per share on July 13, 2017, to stockholders of record as of July 3, 2017, and $.10 per share on October 13, 2017, to stockholders of record as of October 3, 2017 and also declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share on December 22, 2017, which was paid on January 13, 2018, to stockholders of record on January 3, 2018. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid $1,767,486, $1,415,180 and $873,499 in dividends on common stock.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPremises and equipment increased $9,488,067 (89%) from $10,607,094 to $20,095,161 as of December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to the Hometown acquisition.\nInterest expense on deposits increased $1,467,583 (64%) during 2017 as the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased $38,148,000 (8%), while the average interest rate paid to depositors increased 25 basis points to 0.75%. The increase in asset growth opportunities among institutions in our market have created significant competitive pressures on deposit rates\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $824,620 (14%) due to a few significant factors.\n\nLiquidity refers to the ability to manage future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and fund operations. Maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity allows the Company to have sufficient funds available for customer demand for loans, withdrawal of deposit balances and maturities of deposits and other liabilities. The Company's primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, customer deposits and FHLB borrowings. The Company also has established a borrowing line with the Federal Reserve Bank which is considered a secondary source of funds.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $3,841,065 (63%). The increase is primarily driven by addition of interest-bearing deposits as a result of the Hometown acquisition. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $155,580,000 (26%), while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 30 basis points to 1.30%.\nThe increases above were partially offset by the elimination of impairment charges on solar credit investments incurred during 2017, which totaled $440,571.\nSubordinated debentures increased $6,295,829 (41%) from $15,465,000 to $21,760,829 as of December 31, 2018. The increase is due to the assumption of Hometown Bancshares Statutory Trust I as part of the Hometown acquisition.\nVarious commitments and contingent liabilities arise in the normal course of business, which are not required to be recorded on the balance sheet. The most significant of these are loan commitments, lines of credit and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans of approximately $5,600,000 and $7,261,000, respectively. Lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, unused lines of credit to borrowers aggregated approximately $104,570,000 and $117,068,000, respectively, for commercial lines and $22,254,000 and $15,929,000, respectively, for open-end consumer lines. Since a portion of the loan commitment and line of credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total unused commitments and lines do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged or credited to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered adequate by the Company to provide for potential loan losses in the existing loan portfolio. When making its assessment, the Company considers prior loss experience, volume and type of lending, local banking trends and impaired and past due loans in the Company's loan portfolio. In addition, the Company considers general economic conditions and other factors related to collectability of the Company's loan portfolio.\nBased on its internal analysis and methodology, management recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,225,000 and $1,750,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's increase in the provision was primarily due to the increased loan balances and maintaining general portfolio reserves at a level deemed appropriate in accordance with its methodology. The Bank will continue to monitor its allowance for loan losses and make future additions based on economic and regulatory conditions. Management may need to increase the allowance for loan losses through charges to the provision for loan losses if anticipated growth in the Bank's loan portfolio increases or other circumstances warrant. See further discussions of the allowance for loan losses under Financial Condition\u201d above.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, net loans receivable increased by $148,693,597 (24%) to $778,298,606. The addition of $143,918,642 in loans at fair value from the Hometown acquisition along with continued production in the multi-family, agriculture, hospitality and Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) lending were the primary drivers for growth in 2018. During the year, commercial real estate loans increased $61,055,038 (23%), permanent 1-4 family loans increased $26,110,020 (25%), commercial loans increased $24,846,644 (26%), construction loans increased $23,810,413 (37%), and consumer and other loans increased $8,374,570 (34%). The Company continues to focus its lending efforts in the commercial, owner occupied real estate and small business lending categories.\nThe Bank charges borrowers and pays depositors interest rates that are largely a function of the general level of interest rates. The above table sets forth the weekly average interest rates for the 52 weeks ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 as reported by the Federal Reserve. The Bank typically indexes its adjustable rate commercial loans to prime and its adjustable rate mortgage loans to the one-year Treasury Rate. The ten-year Treasury Rate is a proxy for 30-year fixed rate home mortgage loans.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $2,502,340 (15%). Salaries and employee benefits increased $1,353,964 (13%) which was primarily due to the expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market and increases in other key areas of commercial banking, operations and technology. Included in the salaries and benefits increase, the Company had $780,363 of increases in health/retirement benefits and performance incentives due to strong Company results.\nOne-time merger expense related to the Hometown acquisition totaled $3,520,727. The costs relate to legal, accounting and investment advisory fees, as well as the cost incurred for termination of a specific vendor core processing contract of approximately $2 million.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND DECEMBER 31, 2017\nThe primary activity of the Company is to oversee its investment in the Bank. The Company engages in few other activities, and the Company has no significant assets other than its investment in the Bank. For this reason, unless otherwise specified, references to the Company include the operations of the Bank. The Company's principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using such deposits to originate multi-family, construction, agriculture, hospitality, Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) and commercial real estate loans, mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residences, and consumer and business loans. The Company also uses these funds to purchase government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, US government and agency obligations, and other permissible securities. When cash outflows exceed inflows, the Company uses borrowings and brokered deposits as additional financing sources.\nGoodwill increased $1,434,982 (100%) and core deposit intangible increased $2,980,910 (100%) as of December 31, 2018. The increases are due to the Hometown acquisition and are further discussed in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company recognized an increase in service charge income of $814,950 (69%) and debit card interchange income of $285,753 (35%) primarily due to the Hometown acquisition. Also, the Company continued its emphasis on SBA lending that increased gains on the sale of SBA loans by $84,002 (11%).\nIn connection with the Company's issuance and acquisition of the Trust Preferred Securities and pursuant to three guarantee agreements by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, the Company issued a limited, irrevocable guarantee of the obligations of each Trust under the Trust Preferred Securities whereby the Company has guaranteed any and all payment obligations of the Trusts related to the Trust Preferred Securities including distributions on, and the liquidation or redemption price of, the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent each Trust does not have funds available.\nThe Company prepared the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $857,113 (18%). This was primarily due to the Company's emphasis on Small Business Administration (SBA) lending and its continued efforts in fixed-rate mortgage lending. The Company's gains on sale of SBA loans increased $449,177, gains on fixed-rate mortgage loans sales increased $312,730 and net gain on foreclosed assets increased $180,734 when compared to 2016. These gains were partially offset by a decrease in gain on sale of investment securities of $146,208 when compared to 2016.\nThe Company meets the eligibility criteria of a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement issued in February 2015, and is no longer obligated to report consolidated regulatory capital. The Bank continues to be subject to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. The Bank's capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nRates trended upward during 2018 as the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) increased the discount rate by 25 basis points in March, June, September and December 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the prime rate was 5.50% which is a 100 basis point increase from December 31, 2017.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $4,051,407 (16%). The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $78,175,000 (12%), while the yield on average interest earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.14%.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nStandby letters of credit are irrevocable conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Bank had total outstanding standby letters of credit amounting to $12,218,000 and $12,733,000 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The commitments extend over varying periods of time.\nAs of December 31, 2018, management identified loans totaling $20,552,000 as impaired with a related allowance for loan losses of $1,612,000. Impaired loans increased by $9,725,000 during 2018, compared to the balance of $10,827,000 at December 31, 2017.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for acquisition accounting, the loans acquired through the Hometown acquisition were recorded at fair value; therefore, there was no allowance associated with these loans. Management continues to evaluate the allowance need on the acquired loans factoring in the net remaining discount of $2.45 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe Company may from time to time make written or oral \"forward-looking statements\", including statements contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits thereto), in its reports to stockholders and in other communications by the Company, which are made in good faith by the Company pursuant to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, words such as anticipates,\u201d estimates,\u201d believes,\u201d expects,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.\nAVERAGE BALANCES, INTEREST AND AVERAGE YIELDS\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $1,909,542 (46%) as the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $61,089,000 (11%), while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 24 basis points to 1.00%.\n\nAmortization expense of the core deposit intangible from the Hometown acquisition was $408,571 for 2018. There was no amortization during 2017.\nBased on its internal analysis and methodology, management recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,750,000 and $1,375,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company's increase in the provision was primarily due to the increased loan balances and maintaining general portfolio reserves at a level deemed appropriate in accordance with its methodology.\nCash Dividends Paid. The Company paid dividends of $0.12 per share on April 19, 2018 to stockholders of record as of April 9, 2018, $0.12 per share on July 19, 2018, to stockholders of record as of July 9, 2018, and $.12 per share on October 19, 2018, to stockholders of record as of October 9, 2018. The Company also declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per share on December 21, 2018, which was paid on January 14, 2019, to stockholders of record on January 4, 2019. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company paid $2,132,221, $1,767,486 and $1,415,180 in dividends on common stock.\nGuaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc. (the Company\u201d) is a Delaware corporation organized on December 30, 1997 that operates as a one-bank holding company. Guaranty Bank (the Bank\u201d) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nThe Company's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, and certificates of deposit with other financial institutions that have an original maturity of three months or less. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank's operating, financing, and investment activities at any given time. The Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $34,121,642 as of December 31, 2018 and $37,406,930 as of December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $3,285,288. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows, which are subject to, and influenced by, many factors. The Bank has $153,851,915 in certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in one year or less. Management anticipates that the majority of these certificates will renew in the normal course of operations. Based on existing collateral as well as the FHLB's limitation of advances to 35% of assets, the Bank has the ability to borrow an additional $120,599,000 from the FHLB, as of December 31, 2018. Based on existing collateral, the Bank has the ability to borrow $53,700,000 from the Federal Reserve Bank as of December 31, 2018. The Bank plans to maintain its FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings to a level that will provide a borrowing capacity sufficient to provide for contingencies. Management has many policies and controls in place to attempt to manage the appropriate level of liquidity.\nThe Bank charges borrowers and pays depositors interest rates that are largely a function of the general level of interest rates. The above table sets forth the weekly average interest rates for the 52 weeks ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 as reported by the Federal Reserve. The Bank typically indexes its adjustable rate commercial loans to prime and its adjustable rate mortgage loans to the one-year Treasury Rate. The ten-year Treasury Rate is a proxy for 30-year fixed rate home mortgage loans.\nNet Interest Income. The Company's net interest income increased $2,141,865 (10%) primarily due to the increase in overall average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Refer to the tables in the Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields\u201d section (pages 47 and 48) for additional information on components of net interest income.\nNote payable to bank increased $5,000,000 (100%) when compared to December 31, 2017 due to the Company borrowing $5,000,000 from another financial institution. The funds were used to provide additional capital for funding Bank asset growth. The note carries a variable interest rate tied to three-month LIBOR and matures on June 28, 2020.\nUnlike most companies, the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In the current interest rate environment, liquidity and the maturity structure of the Bank's assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, deposits increased $142,254,472 (23%) to $749,618,822. Deposit balances totaling $161,248,424 (at fair value) were added as a result of the Hometown acquisition. Excluding the acquired balances, checking and savings transaction balances decreased by $40,855,842 and certificates of deposit increased $22,077,932. The decline in transaction balances were primarily a result of a decrease of $34,591,000 in one brokered money market relationship and various declines in accounts acquired by Hometown. Overall, brokered deposits decreased $18,173,000 during 2018. The Company utilizes brokered certificates of deposit as a tool to manage cost of funds and to efficiently match changes in liquidity needs based on loan growth.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that revised its risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations to align them with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act ( Basel III Rule\u201d). The Basel III Rule implemented a revised definition of regulatory capital, a new common equity tier 1 ( CET1\u201d) minimum capital requirement, and a higher minimum tier1 capital requirement. The final rules also made changes to the prompt corrective action framework for depository institutions by incorporating the new minimum capital ratios into the framework, introducing the CET1 capital measure, and aligning the definition of tangible equity for purposes of the critically undercapitalized prompt corrective action category with the definition of tier 1 capital. Under the Basel III Rule, the following three components comprise a banking organization's regulatory capital\u201d: (i) CET1 capital,\u201d which is predominantly comprised of retained earnings and common stock instruments that meet certain criteria and related surplus (net of any treasury stock), AOCI (for organizations that do not make opt-out elections), and CET1 minority interest, which are subject to certain restrictions; (ii) Additional Tier 1 Capital,\u201d which consists of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and similar instruments meeting specified eligibility criteria and related surplus, Tier 1 minority interests not included in CET1 capital, and TARP\u201d preferred stock and other instruments issued under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008; and (iii) Tier 2 Capital,\u201d which includes instruments such as subordinated debt that has a minimum original maturity of at least five years and is subordinated to the claims of depositors and general creditors, total capital minority interest not included in Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of a banking organization's allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL), less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased $715,936 (28%) over 2017 which is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) signed into law on December 22, 2017. As a result of the Act, in 2017, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates, which resulted in a one-time charge to income tax expense of approximately $1.0 million. In 2018, the Company's federal tax rate was reduced from 34% to 21% as a result of the Act.\nThe Company has identified the accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses, goodwill and intangible assets, related significant estimates and judgments as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these significant estimates and judgments and our accounting policies, also see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in this report.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of loans acquired with the possibility of impairment and the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans and fair values. In connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of foreclosed assets held for sale, management obtains independent appraisals for significant properties.\nEffective January 1, 2015, the final rule requires the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the prior requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets (unchanged from the prior requirement). When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Rule will require the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% \"capital conservation buffer\" effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation); (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $9,855,247 (50%) due to a few significant factors.\nBeginning January 1, 2016, the capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.\nThe Company's occupancy expense increased $377,199 (21%) primarily due to the Company's continued enhancements in facilities (including signage) and significant investments in new technologies. The continued expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market has also played a factor in the increase in expense.\nCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe following table sets forth information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated resulting from changes in average balances and average rates shown in the previous table. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities information is provided with respect to changes attributable to: (i) changes in balance (change in balance multiplied by the old rate), (ii) changes in interest rates (change in rate multiplied by the old balance); and (iii) the combined effect of changes in balance and interest rates (change in balance multiplied by change in rate). Dollar amounts are expressed in thousands.\nThe Company's occupancy expense increased $1,866,791 (85%) primarily due to the Company's continued enhancements in facilities (including signage) and significant investments in new technologies. A full year of occupancy expense on our new headquarter facility and the ongoing expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market has also played a significant factor in the increase in expense.\nNet Interest Income. The Company's net interest income increased $9,963,906 (43%) primarily due to the increase in overall average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Refer to the tables in the Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields\u201d section (pages 47 and 48) for additional information on components of net interest income.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $2,878,168 (24%) which was primarily due to the addition of Hometown employees and our continued expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market and increases in other key areas of commercial banking, operations and technology.\nInterest income on loans increased $4,139,313 (18%). The average loan receivable balance increased $94,444,000 (18%) while the average yield decreased 3 basis points to 4.51%. The Company experienced strong loan activity during 2017. However, pricing on loans is challenging due to significant competition on new and renewing credits. The pricing pressure has impacted the ability to maintain loan yield compared to 2016.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes that increased $557,985 (28%) over 2016 was primarily a result of the Company's $1.0 million charge for the deferred tax asset write-down which was partially offset by the utilization of tax credits which is discussed above. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates. As of December 31, 2017, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset and it resulted in a one-time charge to income tax expense of approximately $1.0 million.\nInterest Rates\n\nRates trended upward during 2017 as the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) increased the discount rate by 25 basis points in March, June and December 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the prime rate was 4.5% which is a 75 basis point increase from December 31, 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged or credited to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered adequate by the Company to provide for potential loan losses in the existing loan portfolio. When making its assessment, the Company considers prior loss experience, volume and type of lending, local banking trends and impaired and past due loans in the Company's loan portfolio. In addition, the Company considers general economic conditions and other factors related to collectability of the Company's loan portfolio.\nInterest income on investment securities decreased $103,474 (5%). The average balance of investment securities decreased $13,692,000 (14%) while the average yield improved 18 basis points to 2.05%.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $13,804,971 (47%). The increase is primarily driven by the addition of earning assets as a result of the Hometown acquisition. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $174,348,000 (25%), while the yield on average interest earning assets increased 74 basis points to 4.88%.\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances increased $11,000,000 (12%) from $94,300,000 as of December 31, 2017 to $105,300,000 as of December 31, 2018 due to increased borrowings to fund growth.\nAGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAlthough the Bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level which it considers to be sufficient to provide for potential loan losses in its existing loan portfolio. In addition, the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by regulatory agencies which can order the establishment of additional loan loss provisions.\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. If actual results are different than management's judgments and estimates, the Company's financial results could change, and such change could be material to the Company.\nFrom December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, available-for-sale securities increased $5,037,524 (6%), primarily due to $7,520,849 of securities acquired in the Hometown acquisition. The Company purchased $26,151,079 of investments while having sales and principal payments received of $26,965,492. The Company had net unrealized losses of $1,836,406 at December 31, 2018 compared to $844,379 at December 31, 2017.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nInterest Rates\nThe following table shows the balances as of December 31, 2018 of various categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding yields and costs, and, for the periods indicated: (1) the average balances of various categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, (2) the total interest earned or paid thereon, and (3) the resulting weighted average yields and costs. In addition, the table shows the Company's rate spreads and net yields. Average balances are based on daily balances. Tax-free income is not material; accordingly, interest income and related average yields have not been calculated on a tax equivalent basis. Average loan balances include non-accrual loans. Dollar amounts are expressed in thousands.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of the Company's plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions that are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the Company's control). The following factors, among others, could cause the Company's financial performance to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements: the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the real estate values and the local economies in which the Company conducts operations; risks associated with the completion of the recent acquisition of Hometown and its wholly-owned subsidiary Hometown Bank and the integration of Hometown Bank with the Bank, including the possibility that we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition\u037e future mergers or acquisitions; the impact of recent and potential future changes in the laws, rules, regulations, interpretations and policies relating to financial institutions, accounting, tax, monetary and fiscal matters and their application by our regulators; the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, changes in interest rates; changes in LIBOR; the timely development of and acceptance of new products and services of the company and the perceived overall value of these products and services by users, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors' products and services; the impact of changes in financial services' laws and regulations (including laws concerning taxes, banking, securities and insurance); asset quality deterioration; environmental liability associated with real estate collateral; technological changes and cybersecurity risks; acquisitions; employee retention; the success of the Company at managing the risks resulting from these factors; and other factors set forth in reports and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time. For further information about these and other risks, uncertainties and factors, please review the disclosure included in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company acquired Carthage, Missouri-based Hometown Bancshares, Inc. ( Hometown\u201d) including its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Hometown Bank, National Association and Hometown Bancshares Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust on April 2, 2018. Hometown's subsidiary bank, Hometown Bank, National Association, was merged into Guaranty Bank on June 8, 2018. Including the effects of acquisition method accounting adjustments, the Company acquired approximately $178.8 million in assets, including approximately $143.9 million in loans (inclusive of loan discounts) and approximately $161.2 million in deposits. Goodwill of $1.4 million was also recorded as a result of this transaction. The acquisition strengthened the Company's position in Southwest Missouri and the Company believes it will be able to achieve cost savings by integrating the two companies and combining accounting, data processing and other administrative functions all of which gave rise to the goodwill recorded. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe Company incurred $587,428 (100%) of impairment charges on solar tax credit investments in 2017. The Company purchased an interest in a utility scale solar energy project. The project was expected to generate an estimated $557,000 of 2017 investment tax credits plus additional tax credits in future years assuming certain compliance criteria are met. The cost of the investment will be accounted for under the equity and hypothetical liquidation at book value methods. Under these methods, an impairment charge is recorded on the investment equal to the discounted future cash flows compared to the carrying value of the investment.\nGoodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to periodic impairment testing. This testing is to be performed annually, or more frequently if events occur that lead to the possibility that the valuation of such assets could be considered unrecoverable.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date as of December 31, 2018. Dollar amounts are expressed in thousands.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe Company has three active wholly-owned subsidiaries other than the Bank, its principal subsidiary: (i) Guaranty Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust; (ii) Guaranty Statutory Trust II, a Delaware statutory trust; and (iii) Hometown Bancshares Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust and a fourth inactive subsidiary. The Guaranty Trusts were formed in December 2005. The Hometown Bancshares Trust was formed on October 29, 2002 and assumed by the Company on April 2, 2018. The exclusive purpose of each Trust was issuing trust preferred securities to acquire junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. The Company's banking operation conducted through the Bank is the Company's only reportable segment. See also the discussion contained in the section captioned Segment Information\u201d in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. The fourth subsidiary is a service corporation which has been inactive since February 1, 2003.", "item_7_tables": "Table 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td>
