Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.\nOverview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to focus our efforts on sales execution and growing the revenue of our newer, value-added products and technologies. In addition, on March 4, 2019 we launched our exciting new line of products for the restaurant solution's market, the BOHA! branded suite of cloud-based applications and companion hardware solutions. The new BOHA! products are a suite of products proving a solution to help restaurants and food service operators of any size automate back-of-house operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 we completed the build-out of our European casino and gaming internal sales team and started selling directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end-user casino and gaming customers in Europe as we terminated our relationship with our worldwide casino and gaming distributor. As a result of this investment, international casino and gaming sales increased 81% in 2018 compared to 2017. During 2018, we also recognized the initial sale of our new Epic Edge ticket-in, ticket-out ( TITO\u201d) printer for a large domestic operator's upcoming new casino opening.\nSales for our lottery market and TransAct Services Group ( TSG\u201d) market decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to lower sales to International Gaming Technology and its subsidiaries ( IGT\u201d). TSG sales to IGT decreased due to lower sales of spare parts in the lottery market during 2018 compared to 2017. These sales declines were as expected as we are no longer focusing on the lottery markets. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments we expect lottery and TSG sales to continue to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our total net sales decreased 3% to approximately $54.6 million. See the table below for a breakdown of our sales by market:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestaurant solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,579\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n8.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,758\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n8.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(179\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3.8\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPOS automation and banking\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7,273\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n14.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(632\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(8.0\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCasino and gaming\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n26,593\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n48.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n18,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n33.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7,978\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n42.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLottery\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3,093\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n9,805\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n17.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(6,712\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(68.5\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrintrex\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,297\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,052\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n23.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTSG\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n11,752\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n21.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n14,176\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n25.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(2,424\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(17.1\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n54,587\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n56,311\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,724\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3.1\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales of our restaurant solutions products decreased approximately 4% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. In the restaurant solutions market, we continue to focus on providing terminals that print food rotational date and nutritional labels to help restaurants and other food service establishments effectively manage food rotation and safety. The decrease in restaurant solutions sales resulted from lower sales of our AccuDate\u2122 9700 terminal due to lower sales to McDonald's. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our newer AccuDate XL2e terminal to three large corporate customers. In 2019, we intend to focus on developing and selling our new BOHA! cloud-based SaaS applications and hardware solutions business.\nSales of our POS automation and banking products decreased 8% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. In the POS market, we focus primarily on supplying printers that print receipts or linerless labels for customers in the restaurant and quick serve markets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the decline in sales of our POS automation and banking printers was primarily driven by a 75% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers as we exit these markets. In the banking market, we had focused mainly on supplying printers for use in bank teller stations at banks and financial institutions primarily in the U.S. As we continue to shift our focus to our newer products, we do not expect any future sales of these legacy products, as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018. POS automation and banking sales also decreased, although to a lesser extent, due to lower sales of our Ithaca 9000 printers during 2018 compared to the record sales levels of the Ithaca 9000 in 2017.\nSales of our casino and gaming products increased approximately 43% in 2018 compared to 2017. In our casino and gaming market, our focus lies primarily in supplying printers worldwide for use in slot machines at casinos and racetracks, as well as in other electronic gaming devices that print tickets or receipts. Additionally, we supplement these printer sales with revenue from EPICENTRAL\u2122, our promotional printing system that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and print them real time at the slot machine. The increase of casino and gaming printer sales is primarily due to increased domestic and international sales of our thermal casino printers of 20% and 143%, respectively. The increase in domestic thermal casino printers was driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs and a large order of replacement printers from a domestic casino operator. The increase in international thermal casino printer sales was due to the successful transition away from using our former exclusive worldwide distributor. Rather, we employed our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. Casino and gaming sales also increased due to a 58% increase in sales of our off-premise gaming printers.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, total lottery printer sales decreased approximately 69% due primarily to lower sales to IGT. Domestic lottery sales decreased 65% in 2018 compared to 2017. International lottery sales decreased $1.1 million due to a sale to IGT in 2017 for the Canadian lottery and no comparable sales in 2018. Our sales to IGT each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for 2019 compared to 2018, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher-value, technology-enabled market for restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.\nSales of our Printrex branded printers include wide format, rack mounted and vehicle mounted thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we experienced an approximately 23% increase in Printrex product sales due primarily to the continued recovery of the worldwide oil and gas market that had been negatively impacted from multiple years of declining worldwide oil prices. Although we expect to see continued modest growth in the oil and gas markets during 2019, we do not anticipate significant contribution to total sales from our Printrex products as we shift our focus towards our higher value, technology enabled restaurant solution terminals and casino and gaming products.\nTSG, which sells service, replacement parts and consumable products, including food safety labels, receipt paper, ribbons and inkjet cartridges, continues to offer a recurring revenue stream for the Company. TSG sales decreased 17% in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to unusually high sales of replacement parts to IGT for a legacy lottery printer in 2017. Although the installed base of our thermal lottery printers remains large, and lotteries continue to extend lottery contracts utilizing our existing hardware, including our printers, based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments, primarily from IGT for spare parts, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\nOperationally, our gross margin reached 49% in 2018, an increase of 170 basis points from 2017, representing the highest gross margin we have reported for a full year. We believe gross margin will continue at similar levels in 2019 as our newer, technology-enabled products continue to grow and become a larger portion of our overall sales. In 2018, although operating income decreased slightly by less than 1%, we achieved operating margin of 12.4% compared to 12.1% in 2017 due to our improved gross margin that was offset by slightly higher operating expenses primarily to support our two high growth markets--restaurant solutions and casino and gaming. During 2019, we expect higher operating expenses compared to 2018, due to the full year impact of the investments made during 2018, as well as new investments, in selling and marketing for these two high growth markets\nWe reported net income of $5.4 million and net income per diluted share of $0.70 for 2018, compared to $3.2 million and net income per diluted share of $0.42 for 2017. In terms of cash flow for 2018, we experienced a very strong year, generating $5.1 million of cash from operating activities. We also returned $4.7 million to our shareholders in the form of $2 million for treasury share repurchases and $2.7 million for cash dividends. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 million and no debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect both Balance Sheet items and Statement of Income categories. Such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances. We evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates. Actual results may differ from the original estimates.\nThe following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements. These items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are therefore based on our judgment. Please refer to Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition - ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and its related amendments (collectively, ASC 606) are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. This ASU is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies in revenue requirements; providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or modified retrospective approach to adopt the amended guidance. We adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 and elected the modified retrospective approach. The results for periods before 2018 were not adjusted for the new standard and there was no cumulative effect for the change in accounting at the date of adoption.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while other contracts contain multiple performance obligations (most commonly when contracts include product and extended warranties). A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as price protection, reserves for returns and other allowances, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value\u201d method or the most likely amount\u201d method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company's judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.\nFor a majority of our revenue, which consists of printers, terminals, consumables, and replacement parts, the Company recognizes revenue as of a point of time. The transaction price is recognized upon shipment of the order when control of the goods is transferred to the customer and at the time the performance obligation is fulfilled. We also sell a software solution, EPICENTRAL\u2122, that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real-time at the slot machine. EPICENTRALTM is primarily comprised of both a software component, which is licensed to the customer, and a hardware component. EPICENTRAL\u2122 software and hardware are integrated to deliver the system's full functionality. The transaction prices from EPICENTRAL\u2122 software license and hardware are recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer when control of the license is transferred to the customer. For out-of-warranty repairs, the transaction price is recognized after the repair work is completed and the printer or terminal is returned to the customer, as control of the product is transferred to the customer and our performance obligation is completed.\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment. For our separately priced extended warranty, technical support for our restaurant solution terminals and maintenance agreements (including free one-year maintenance received by the customers upon completion of EPICENTRAL\u2122 installation) revenue is recognized over time as the customer receives the benefit. The transaction price from the maintenance services is recognized ratably over time, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer. For extended warranties, the transaction price is recognized ratably over the warranty period, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer.\nWhen there is more than one performance obligation in a customer arrangement, the Company typically uses the standalone selling price\u201d method to determine the transaction price to allocate to each performance obligation. The Company sells the performance obligations separately and has established standalone selling prices for its products and services. In the case of an overall price discount, the discount is applied to each performance obligation proportionately based on standalone selling price. To determine the standalone selling price for initial EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations, the Company uses the adjusted market assessment approach.\nAccounts\nReceivable - We have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts, including: credit reviews of all new customer accounts; ongoing credit evaluations of current customers; credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information; and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current creditworthiness. We also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2018 was $205 thousand, or 2.5% of outstanding accounts receivable, which we believe is appropriate considering the overall quality of our accounts receivable. Although credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established, there is no assurance that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience.\nInventories - Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. We review net realizable value based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion, disposal and transportation, historical usage and estimates of future demand. Assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made, as necessary, to reflect changing market conditions. Based on these reviews, inventory write-downs are recorded, as necessary, to reflect estimated obsolescence, excess quantities and net realizable value. Should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence, additional write-downs of inventory could result in a charge to income.\nGoodwill\nand Intangible Assets - We acquire businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with ASC 350-20 Goodwill\u201d, acquired goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change, which indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. Factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate. We reported $2.6 million of goodwill and $797 thousand of unamortized definite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2018. We have determined that no goodwill or intangible asset impairment has occurred and the fair value of goodwill was substantially higher than our carrying value based on our assessment as of December 31, 2018 when the impairment review is performed.\nIncome\nTaxes - In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, as well as net operating losses, tax credits and other carryforwards. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and, in particular, any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years, and match this forecast against the basis differences, deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets. Although we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Among other things this provision prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity's financial statements. It also requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if, as of the balance sheet reporting date, it is more likely than not\u201d (i.e., more than a 50% likelihood) that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits. When making this assessment, management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information. The accounting guidance also clarifies the method of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a company's income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of the Tax Reform Act.\nWarranty - We generally warrant our products for up to 24 months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded. Estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs. If actual future product repair rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates, adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made.\nShare-Based\nCompensation - We calculate share-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of share-based awards. The key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Prior to January 1, 2017, stock-based compensation expense included estimated effects of forfeitures. Upon adopting ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d, in 2017, an accounting policy election was made to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amended guidance requires that all tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement, rather than through equity. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. This ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase additional employee shares for tax withholding purposes without requiring liability accounting and clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee's behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation requirements\nResults of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet Sales. Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestaurant solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,579\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n8.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,758\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n8.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(179\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3.8\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPOS automation and banking\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7,273\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n14.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(632\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(8.0\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCasino and gaming\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n26,593\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n48.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n18,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n33.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7,978\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n42.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLottery\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3,093\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n9,805\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n17.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(6,712\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(68.5\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrintrex\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,297\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,052\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n23.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTSG\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n11,752\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n21.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n14,176\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n25.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(2,424\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(17.1\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n54,587\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n56,311\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,724\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3.1\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational*\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,069\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n20.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,591\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,478\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n45.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>* </td> <td> International sales do not include sales of products made to domestic distributors or other customers who in turn ship those products to international destinations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales for 2018 decreased $1.7 million, or approximately 3%, from 2017. Printer and terminal sales volume decreased by 5% to approximately 142,000 units, driven primarily by a 71% decrease in unit volume from the lottery market and, to a lesser extent, a 6% and 18% decrease in the POS automation and banking market and restaurant solutions market, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales volume of 44% in the casino and gaming market. Although unit volume decreased during 2018 compared to 2017, the average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 7% during 2018 compared to 2017, due primarily to the decreased volume of lottery printers, which carry lower prices than our other products.\nInternational sales increased $3.5 million, or 46%, primarily driven by 81% higher international sales in the casino and gaming market. This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million sales decrease in our international lottery market during 2018 compared to 2017.\nRestaurant solutions: Revenue from the restaurant solutions market includes sales of terminals that combine hardware and software in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and \"enjoy by\" date labels to help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-restaurant operations. A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,133\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 90.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,384\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (251\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,579\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,758\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (179\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to McDonald's. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our newer AccuDate XL2e terminal to three large corporate customers. We expect sales of our restaurant solutions products to increase in 2019 compared to 2018 following the launch of our new BOHA! cloud-based applications and hardware solutions in the first quarter of 2019. The new BOHA! suite of products is designed to provide back-of-house automation solutions to restaurant and foodservice operators.\nInternational restaurant solutions sales increased during 2018 compared to 2017 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 for McDonald's through our Canadian distributor.\nPOS automation and banking: Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal printers used primarily by quick serve restaurants located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels. In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations. A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,122\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n97.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,596\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n96.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(474\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(6.2\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(158\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(51.1\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,273\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(632\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(8.0\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by a 75% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers. We do not expect any future sales of these legacy products, as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018 and have shifted our focus to our newer products. These decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in domestic sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printers of 1% during 2018 compared to 2017, as sales rebounded to prior year, near-record levels during the second and third quarters of 2018. We expect sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 for McDonald's to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\nInternational POS automation and banking sales decreased due to lower sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald's during 2018 compared to 2017.\nCasino and Gaming: Revenue\nfrom the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals, and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide. Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments. Revenue from this market also includes royalties related to our patented casino and gaming technology. In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL\u2122 print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine. A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,518\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n65.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,608\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n73.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,910\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n28.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n9,075\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n34.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n5,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n26.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n4,068\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n81.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,593\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,978\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n42.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due primarily to a 20% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer in 2018 compared to 2017, driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs and a large order from a domestic casino operator for replacement printers. Domestic sales also increased due to a significant sale of our off-premise gaming printers to an OEM that we don't expect to reoccur in 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we also sold our first order of our Epic Edge, our new thermal TITO casino printer, to a large domestic operator in connection with its upcoming casino opening. Sales of EPICENTRAL\u2122 software during 2018 were comparable with our 2017 EPICENTRAL\u2122 sales as we completed two new installations during both 2018 and 2017. Sales of EPICENTRAL\u2122 are project based, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nThe increase in international sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to a 143% increase of thermal casino printer sales. These increases were due to the success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor whose contract ended at the end of 2017 and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. These increases were partially offset by a 5% decrease in international sales of off-premise gaming printers.\nWe expect domestic and international casino and gaming sales in 2019 to be relatively consistent with the sales levels achieved during 2018.\nLottery: Revenue\nfrom the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to IGT and, to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,046\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n98.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,626\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n88.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,580\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(64.7\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,179\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n12.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(1,132\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(96.0\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,093\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,805\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,712\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(68.5\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations that IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. However, our lottery market sales are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for 2019 compared to 2018, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher-value, technology enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.\nThe decrease in international lottery sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a sale of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in 2017 and no comparable sale occurring in 2018.\nPrintrex: Printrex\nbranded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies. Revenue in this market also includes sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,028\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n79.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n80.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n21.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n20.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n19.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n32.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,297\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,052\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n23.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in Printrex sales in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted from a 57% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers due to a continued recovery in the oil and gas market. This increase was partially offset by 87% lower sales of domestic and international medical and mobile printers in 2018 compared to 2017. We expect total Printrex sales to increase slightly in 2019 compared to 2018, as we expect oil and gas sales to continue to increase. However, we do not expect any future medical and mobile printer sales, as we exited this market at the end of 2018 in order to focus on our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.\nTSG: Revenue generated by our TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges. A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,671\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n90.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,657\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n96.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,986\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(21.9\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,081\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n9.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n108.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,752\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,176\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,424\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(17.1\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in domestic revenue from TSG in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to lower sales of replacement parts, non-Printrex consumable products and service revenue. Replacement part sales decreased 36% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. Non-Printrex consumables sales declined 10% due to lower sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers, as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018. Service revenue declined 10% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to paper testing sales that occurred in 2017 but did not repeat in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by increased AccuDate label sales which more than quadrupled in 2018 compared 2017. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments for replacement parts, primarily from IGT, for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\nInternationally, TSG revenue increased primarily due to a 134% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in 2018 compared to 2017, as sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers have increased upon the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers.\nGross\nProfit. Gross profit information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,743\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,662\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n0.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n49.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n47.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations of our EPICENTRAL\u2122 print system. Gross profit increased $81 thousand, or less than 1%, and gross margin increased 170 basis points due primarily to a more favorable sales mix in 2018 compared to 2017. The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology driven solutions, as well as lower sales volume of lottery and POS printers, which carry lower margins than our other products.\nOperating\nExpenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,576\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,303\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n6.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n8.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEngineering, design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design, development and testing services, supplies and contracted software development expenses). Engineering, design and product development expenses increased $273 thousand, or 6%, in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering staff and increased expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets. We expect engineering, design and product development expenses in 2019 to be consistent with 2018.\nOperating\nExpenses - Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,203\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,561\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(4.7\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n13.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses decreased $358 thousand, or 5%, in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of sales commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ. These decreases were partially offset by the hiring of additional sales staff to replace our former exclusive worldwide distributor with a direct selling team for our casino and gaming sales in Europe. We expect selling and marketing expense to increase significantly in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the full year impact from the hiring of additional sales staff during the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as new investments to support our new suite of BOHA! software and hardware solutions.\nOperating\nExpenses - General and Administrative. General and administrative information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,205\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,984\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n15.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n14.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resources and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company. General and administrative expenses increased $221 thousand, or 3%, in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to increased legal expenses and increased administrative expenses related to the expansion of our restaurant solutions sales staff and transitioning to a direct selling model for the casino and gaming market in Europe. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense in 2018 compared to 2017. We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher incentive compensation and additional investment to support restaurant solutions.\nOperating\nIncome. Operating income information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,759\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,814\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(0.8\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n12.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n12.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating income decreased by $55 thousand, or 1%. Despite a sales decline of 3% our operating margin improved, increasing 30 basis points to 12.4% in 2018 compared to 12.1% in 2017, largely due to a 170 basis point increase in gross margin somewhat offset by a 1% increase in operating expenses.\nInterest. We\nrecorded net interest expense of $27 thousand in 2018 compared to $33 thousand in 2017.\nOther,\nnet. We recorded other expense of $266 thousand in 2018 compared to $9 thousand in 2017. The additional expense was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our United Kingdom ( UK\u201d) subsidiary in 2018 compared to 2017. Going forward we may continue to experience more foreign exchange volatility as we increase our casino and gaming sales in Europe.\nIncome\nTaxes. We recorded an income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $1.0 million at an effective tax rate of 16.1%, compared to an income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $3.6 million at an effective tax rate of 52.6%. The effective tax rate in 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate in 2017 due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017. Additionally, the effective tax rate in 2017 was unusually high due to the initial impact of the Tax Reform Act as we recognized a provisional $1.3 million charge to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of revaluing our net deferred tax assets using the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. The Tax Reform Act significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Reform Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate effective January 1, 2018 and, as a result, reduced our statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2019 to be between 12% and 14%.\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2018 of $5.4 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to $3.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for 2017.\nResults of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales.

Printer and terminal sales volume decreased by 13% to approximately 150 thousand units, driven primarily by a 25% and 13% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and casino and gaming market, respectively and, to a lesser extent a 3% decrease in the lottery market and 13% decrease in the restaurant solutions market. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales volume of 112% in the Printrex market. The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to decreased volume of POS automation and banking printers sold in 2017, which carry lower prices than our other products.\nOverall, international sales decreased $4.1 million, or 35%, primarily driven by lower sales in the international casino and gaming market. This decrease was partially offset by a $1 million sales increase in our international lottery market during 2017.\nRestaurant solutions: A\nsummary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,384\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,747\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (363\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (41\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,758\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,162\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our U.S. distributor.

We completed two EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations in both 2017 and 2016, however in 2017 our installations consisted of one full-feature version of EPICENTRAL\u2122 and our first EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE version compared to two full-feature versions of EPICENTRAL\u2122 in 2016. Our EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE software is offered at a lower price compared to our full-feature version of EPICENTRAL\u2122.\nInternational casino and gaming printer sales declined in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a 46% decrease in international sales of our thermal casino printers in Europe, Asia and Australia, as well as a 46% decrease in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to our former exclusive worldwide distributor in Europe and Australia. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. International EPICENTRAL\u2122 software sales also declined 79% as we completed no international EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations in 2017 compared to one completed international installation in

2016 due to higher demand for spare parts in the lottery market in 2017. The increase, to a lesser extent, was also due to a 12% increase in project-oriented testing services that occurred in 2017 but did not occur to the same extent in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-Printrex consumables, largely for legacy POS and banking printers in 2017 compared to 2016.\nGross\nProfit.

We\nrecorded net interest expense of $33 thousand in 2017 compared to $26 thousand in 2016.\nOther,\nnet. We recorded other expense of $9 thousand in 2017 compared to $4 thousand in 2016. The change was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our UK subsidiary in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, we recorded a gain of $5 thousand on the disposal of fixed assets in 2016.\nIncome\nTaxes. In 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $3.6 million at an effective tax rate of 52.6% compared to an income tax provision in 2016 of $1.6 million at an effective tax rate of 30.0%. The effective tax rate in 2017 was negatively impacted by the passage of the Tax Reform Act. As a result of the reduction of our U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $1.3 million charge to income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2017 of $3.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $3.6 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, treasury share repurchases, dividend payments, access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.\nInternal cash generation together with currently available cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing facilities and an ability to access credit lines, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, treasury share repurchases, dividend payments and any increase in working capital that would be required to accommodate a higher level of business activity. We actively seek to expand by acquisition as well as through the growth of our current business. While a significant acquisition may require additional debt and/or equity financing, although no assurances can be given, we believe that we would be able to obtain additional financing based on our historical earnings performance.\nCash Flow\nDuring 2018 our cash balance decreased $816 thousand, or 15%, from December 31, 2017 and we returned a substantial portion of our cash flow to shareholders in the form of $2.7 million of cash dividends paid to common shareholders and $2 million of repurchases of our common stock. Even after funding these items and our capital expenditures, we still ended 2018 with $4.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $2.9 million was held by our UK subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.\nOperating activities: The\nfollowing significant factors primarily affected our cash provided by operating activities of $5.1 million in 2018 as compared to $5.9 million in 2017.

Expenditures in the 2018 period were primarily for computer and networking equipment and furniture and fixtures purchases related to investments made in our UK facility to support the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end-user casino and gaming customers. To a lesser extent, expenditures in the 2018 period included computer and networking equipment for our U.S. operations and leasehold improvements made at our Las Vegas facility. Expenditures in 2017 were primarily comprised of computer and networking equipment, new product tooling equipment and, to a lesser extent, leasehold improvements at our Ithaca, New York facility to upgrade to LED lighting.\nCapital expenditures and additions to capitalized software for 2019 are expected to be approximately $1.3 million, primarily for software development for our new restaurant solutions BOHA! products, new product tooling, and new computer software and equipment purchases.\nFinancing activities: We\nused $4.5 million of cash from financing activities during 2018 to pay dividends of $2.7 million to common shareholders, purchase $2 million of common stock for treasury and $265 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $416 thousand. During 2017, we used $1.9 million of cash from financing activities to pay cash dividends of $2.6 million to common shareholders, purchase $358 thousand of common stock for treasury and $23 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $1 million.\nResource Sufficiency\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows generated from operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.\nCredit Facility and Borrowings\nWe maintain a credit facility (the TD Bank Credit Facility\u201d) with TD Bank N.A. ( TD Bank) which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line. On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022. Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets. We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line. The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.\nThe TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens. We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at December 31, 2018.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> Financial Covenant\n</td> <td> Requirement/Restriction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Calculation at December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating cash flow / Total debt service\n</td> <td>\nMinimum of 1.25 times\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n117.21\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFunded debt / EBITDA\n</td> <td>\nMaximum of 3.0 times\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n0 times\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, undrawn commitments under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.\nShareholder Dividend Payments\nIn 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board's approval each quarter. Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017. Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $2.7 million or $0.36 per share and $2.6 million or $0.35 per share, in 2018 and 2017, respectively. On February 11, 2019, our Board of Directors approved the first quarter 2019 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about March 15, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2019.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program. Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. From the start of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program on March 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, we repurchased 156,410 shares of our common stock for approximately $2 million at an average price per share of $12.79.\nDuring 2016 and 2017, under a prior repurchase program that was in place from February 25, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we purchased 499,843 shares of our common stock for $3.9 million at an average price of $7.86 per share. From January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 4,044,842 shares of common stock for $32.1 million, at an average price of $7.94 per share.\nShareholders' Equity\nShareholders' equity increased $1.6 million to $27.6 million at December 31, 2018 from $26 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to net income of $5.4 million, as well as $148 thousand from the issuance of 96,615 shares of common stock related to employee stock awards, net of relinquishments and share-based compensation expense related to stock awards of $629 thousand. These increases were partially offset by our payment of $2.7 million in dividends and the purchase of 156,410 shares of treasury stock for $2 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,365\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,035\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,743\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7,467\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,467\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,832\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,502\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,743\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements, primarily of fully assembled printers, terminals and component part inventory.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe believe that our business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends during the past three years. However, inflation is still a factor in the worldwide economy and may increase the cost of purchasing products from our contract manufacturers in Asia, as well as the cost of certain raw materials, component parts and labor used in the production of our products. It also may increase our operating expenses, manufacturing overhead expenses and the cost to acquire or replace fixed assets. We have generally been able to maintain or improve our profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent, price increases, and we expect to be able to do the same during 2019.

operate. This involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, as well as net operating losses, tax credits and other carryforwards. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,626\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n88.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,710\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n98.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,084\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(11.2\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1,179\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n12.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n480.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,805\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,913\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(108\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(1.1\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales for our lottery market and TransAct Services Group ( TSG\u201d) market decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to lower sales to International Gaming Technology and its subsidiaries ( IGT\u201d).

Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company's judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,657\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n96.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n92.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,342\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n46.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(262\n</td> <td>\n)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(33.5\n</td> <td>\n%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,176\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,096\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n40.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest.

The transaction price is recognized upon shipment of the order when control of the goods is transferred to the customer and at the time the performance obligation is fulfilled. We also sell a software solution, EPICENTRAL\u2122, that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real-time at the slot machine. EPICENTRALTM is primarily comprised of both a software component, which is licensed to the customer, and a hardware component. EPICENTRAL\u2122 software and hardware are integrated to deliver the system's full functionality. The transaction prices from EPICENTRAL\u2122 software license and hardware are recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer when control of the license is transferred to the customer. For out-of-warranty repairs, the transaction price is recognized after the repair work is completed and the printer or terminal is returned to the customer, as control of the product is transferred to the customer and our performance obligation is completed.\nExpenses - General and Administrative. General and administrative information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2018 of $5.4 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to $3.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for 2017.\nSelling and marketing expenses increased $654 thousand, or 10%, as we completed the build-out of our internal infrastructure, including the hiring of a direct sales force and implementation of a direct marketing campaign dedicated to the restaurant solutions market in 2017.\n \u25cf Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $186 thousand, or 5%, due primarily to a decrease in our accrued incentive compensation. \n\nGross\nNet Sales. Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nand Intangible Assets - We acquire businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with ASC 350-20 Goodwill\u201d, acquired goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change, which indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. Factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate. We reported $2.6 million of goodwill and $797 thousand of unamortized definite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2018. We have determined that no goodwill or intangible asset impairment has occurred and the fair value of goodwill was substantially higher than our carrying value based on our assessment as of December 31, 2018 when the impairment review is performed.\n\n\n\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows generated from operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.\nsummary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nReceivable - We have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts, including: credit reviews of all new customer accounts; ongoing credit evaluations of current customers; credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information; and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current creditworthiness. We also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2018 was $205 thousand, or 2.5% of outstanding accounts receivable, which we believe is appropriate considering the overall quality of our accounts receivable. Although credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established, there is no assurance that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience.\nOperating Expenses - Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nOperating\nShareholder Dividend Payments\nLottery: Revenue\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.\nThe increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to 26% higher sales of our thermal casino printers due mainly to market share gain, including higher sales to our OEMs to support two new casino openings. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in domestic EPICENTRAL\u2122 software sales of 34%. We completed two EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations in both 2017 and 2016, however in 2017 our installations consisted of one full-feature version of EPICENTRAL\u2122 and our first EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE version compared to two full-feature versions of EPICENTRAL\u2122 in 2016. Our EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE software is offered at a lower price compared to our full-feature version of EPICENTRAL\u2122.\n\ncapital expenditures, including capitalized software costs, were $1.5 million and $1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Expenditures in the 2018 period were primarily for computer and networking equipment and furniture and fixtures purchases related to investments made in our UK facility to support the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end-user casino and gaming customers. To a lesser extent, expenditures in the 2018 period included computer and networking equipment for our U.S. operations and leasehold improvements made at our Las Vegas facility. Expenditures in 2017 were primarily comprised of computer and networking equipment, new product tooling equipment and, to a lesser extent, leasehold improvements at our Ithaca, New York facility to upgrade to LED lighting.\nsummary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTaxes. In 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $3.6 million at an effective tax rate of 52.6% compared to an income tax provision in 2016 of $1.6 million at an effective tax rate of 30.0%. The effective tax rate in 2017 was negatively impacted by the passage of the Tax Reform Act. As a result of the reduction of our U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $1.3 million charge to income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nPrintrex: Printrex\nThe increase in Printrex sales in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted from a 57% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers due to a continued recovery in the oil and gas market. This increase was partially offset by 87% lower sales of domestic and international medical and mobile printers in 2018 compared to 2017. We expect total Printrex sales to increase slightly in 2019 compared to 2018, as we expect oil and gas sales to continue to increase. However, we do not expect any future medical and mobile printer sales, as we exited this market at the end of 2018 in order to focus on our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.\nExpenses - General and Administrative. General and administrative information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nOperating\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Among other things this provision prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity's financial statements. It also requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if, as of the balance sheet reporting date, it is more likely than not\u201d (i.e., more than a 50% likelihood) that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits. When making this assessment, management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information. The accounting guidance also clarifies the method of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a company's income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of the Tax Reform Act.\nAs of December 31, 2018, undrawn commitments under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.\nOther,\nNet Sales. Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\n\n \u25cf Deferred income tax provision increased $1.1 million largely due to a $1.3 million charge to income tax expense in 2017 to revalue our net deferred tax asset due to the Tax Reform Act. \nOperationally, our gross margin reached 49% in 2018, an increase of 170 basis points from 2017, representing the highest gross margin we have reported for a full year. We believe gross margin will continue at similar levels in 2019 as our newer, technology-enabled products continue to grow and become a larger portion of our overall sales. In 2018, although operating income decreased slightly by less than 1%, we achieved operating margin of 12.4% compared to 12.1% in 2017 due to our improved gross margin that was offset by slightly higher operating expenses primarily to support our two high growth markets--restaurant solutions and casino and gaming. During 2019, we expect higher operating expenses compared to 2018, due to the full year impact of the investments made during 2018, as well as new investments, in selling and marketing for these two high growth markets\nIncome. Operating income information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nPOS automation and banking: Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal printers used primarily by quick serve restaurants located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels. In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations. A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nOn March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program. Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. From the start of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program on March 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, we repurchased 156,410 shares of our common stock for approximately $2 million at an average price per share of $12.79.\nShareholders' equity increased $1.6 million to $27.6 million at December 31, 2018 from $26 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to net income of $5.4 million, as well as $148 thousand from the issuance of 96,615 shares of common stock related to employee stock awards, net of relinquishments and share-based compensation expense related to stock awards of $629 thousand. These increases were partially offset by our payment of $2.7 million in dividends and the purchase of 156,410 shares of treasury stock for $2 million.\nrecorded net interest expense of $27 thousand in 2018 compared to $33 thousand in 2017.\nNet sales for 2017 decreased $924 thousand, or 2%, from 2016. Printer and terminal sales volume decreased by 13% to approximately 150 thousand units, driven primarily by a 25% and 13% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and casino and gaming market, respectively and, to a lesser extent a 3% decrease in the lottery market and 13% decrease in the restaurant solutions market. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales volume of 112% in the Printrex market. The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to decreased volume of POS automation and banking printers sold in 2017, which carry lower prices than our other products.\n \u25cf We recorded depreciation and amortization of $1.1 million and share-based compensation expense of $609 thousand. \nThe TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens. We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at December 31, 2018.\nFinancing activities: We\nExpenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\n \u25cf Accrued liabilities and other liabilities increased $1.1 million, or 35%, due primarily to an increase in our accrued incentive compensation. \nDuring 2018 our cash balance decreased $816 thousand, or 15%, from December 31, 2017 and we returned a substantial portion of our cash flow to shareholders in the form of $2.7 million of cash dividends paid to common shareholders and $2 million of repurchases of our common stock. Even after funding these items and our capital expenditures, we still ended 2018 with $4.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $2.9 million was held by our UK subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.\nWhen there is more than one performance obligation in a customer arrangement, the Company typically uses the standalone selling price\u201d method to determine the transaction price to allocate to each performance obligation. The Company sells the performance obligations separately and has established standalone selling prices for its products and services. In the case of an overall price discount, the discount is applied to each performance obligation proportionately based on standalone selling price. To determine the standalone selling price for initial EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations, the Company uses the adjusted market assessment approach.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while other contracts contain multiple performance obligations (most commonly when contracts include product and extended warranties). A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price.\nOperating activities: The\n\nPrintrex: A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nThe decrease in domestic revenue from TSG in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to lower sales of replacement parts, non-Printrex consumable products and service revenue. Replacement part sales decreased 36% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. Non-Printrex consumables sales declined 10% due to lower sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers, as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018. Service revenue declined 10% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to paper testing sales that occurred in 2017 but did not repeat in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by increased AccuDate label sales which more than quadrupled in 2018 compared 2017. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments for replacement parts, primarily from IGT, for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect both Balance Sheet items and Statement of Income categories. Such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances. We evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates. Actual results may differ from the original estimates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $717 thousand, or 10%, due primarily to higher incentive compensation expenses incurred in 2017 compared to 2016 and higher recruiting expenses related to the expansion of our sales staff for our restaurant solutions market and European casino and gaming market.\nCredit Facility and Borrowings\nRevenue Recognition - ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and its related amendments (collectively, ASC 606) are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. This ASU is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies in revenue requirements; providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or modified retrospective approach to adopt the amended guidance. We adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 and elected the modified retrospective approach. The results for periods before 2018 were not adjusted for the new standard and there was no cumulative effect for the change in accounting at the date of adoption.\nTSG: A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nWe reported net income of $5.4 million and net income per diluted share of $0.70 for 2018, compared to $3.2 million and net income per diluted share of $0.42 for 2017. In terms of cash flow for 2018, we experienced a very strong year, generating $5.1 million of cash from operating activities. We also returned $4.7 million to our shareholders in the form of $2 million for treasury share repurchases and $2.7 million for cash dividends. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 million and no debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018.\nThe increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due primarily to a 20% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer in 2018 compared to 2017, driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs and a large order from a domestic casino operator for replacement printers. Domestic sales also increased due to a significant sale of our off-premise gaming printers to an OEM that we don't expect to reoccur in 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we also sold our first order of our Epic Edge, our new thermal TITO casino printer, to a large domestic operator in connection with its upcoming casino opening. Sales of EPICENTRAL\u2122 software during 2018 were comparable with our 2017 EPICENTRAL\u2122 sales as we completed two new installations during both 2018 and 2017. Sales of EPICENTRAL\u2122 are project based, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nNet sales for 2018 decreased $1.7 million, or approximately 3%, from 2017. Printer and terminal sales volume decreased by 5% to approximately 142,000 units, driven primarily by a 71% decrease in unit volume from the lottery market and, to a lesser extent, a 6% and 18% decrease in the POS automation and banking market and restaurant solutions market, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales volume of 44% in the casino and gaming market. Although unit volume decreased during 2018 compared to 2017, the average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 7% during 2018 compared to 2017, due primarily to the decreased volume of lottery printers, which carry lower prices than our other products.\nInternational sales increased $3.5 million, or 46%, primarily driven by 81% higher international sales in the casino and gaming market. This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million sales decrease in our international lottery market during 2018 compared to 2017.\n \u25cf We reported a net income of $5.4 million. \nLottery: A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nInternational lottery sales increased due to sales of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in 2017 and no comparable sales occurring in 2016.\nSales of our POS automation and banking products decreased 8% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. In the POS market, we focus primarily on supplying printers that print receipts or linerless labels for customers in the restaurant and quick serve markets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the decline in sales of our POS automation and banking printers was primarily driven by a 75% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers as we exit these markets. In the banking market, we had focused mainly on supplying printers for use in bank teller stations at banks and financial institutions primarily in the U.S. As we continue to shift our focus to our newer products, we do not expect any future sales of these legacy products, as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018. POS automation and banking sales also decreased, although to a lesser extent, due to lower sales of our Ithaca 9000 printers during 2018 compared to the record sales levels of the Ithaca 9000 in 2017.\nInternational casino and gaming printer sales declined in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a 46% decrease in international sales of our thermal casino printers in Europe, Asia and Australia, as well as a 46% decrease in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to our former exclusive worldwide distributor in Europe and Australia. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. International EPICENTRAL\u2122 software sales also declined 79% as we completed no international EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations in 2017 compared to one completed international installation in 2016.\nrecorded net interest expense of $33 thousand in 2017 compared to $26 thousand in 2016.\nSales of our restaurant solutions products decreased approximately 4% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. In the restaurant solutions market, we continue to focus on providing terminals that print food rotational date and nutritional labels to help restaurants and other food service establishments effectively manage food rotation and safety. The decrease in restaurant solutions sales resulted from lower sales of our AccuDate\u2122 9700 terminal due to lower sales to McDonald's. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our newer AccuDate XL2e terminal to three large corporate customers. In 2019, we intend to focus on developing and selling our new BOHA! cloud-based SaaS applications and hardware solutions business.\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resources and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company. General and administrative expenses increased $221 thousand, or 3%, in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to increased legal expenses and increased administrative expenses related to the expansion of our restaurant solutions sales staff and transitioning to a direct selling model for the casino and gaming market in Europe. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense in 2018 compared to 2017. We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher incentive compensation and additional investment to support restaurant solutions.\nStock Repurchase Program\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, total lottery printer sales decreased approximately 69% due primarily to lower sales to IGT. Domestic lottery sales decreased 65% in 2018 compared to 2017. International lottery sales decreased $1.1 million due to a sale to IGT in 2017 for the Canadian lottery and no comparable sales in 2018. Our sales to IGT each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for 2019 compared to 2018, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher-value, technology-enabled market for restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.\nGross profit increased $2.9 million, or 12%, and our gross margin improved 570 basis points to a record 47.3%. These increases were driven by a more favorable sales mix in 2017 compared to 2016, as our 2017 sales included a greater proportion of spare parts sales and a lower portion of sales of POS automation and banking printers.\nfrom the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to IGT and, to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, treasury share repurchases, dividend payments, access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.\nOur operating income decreased by $55 thousand, or 1%. Despite a sales decline of 3% our operating margin improved, increasing 30 basis points to 12.4% in 2018 compared to 12.1% in 2017, largely due to a 170 basis point increase in gross margin somewhat offset by a 1% increase in operating expenses.\nfrom the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals, and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide. Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments. Revenue from this market also includes royalties related to our patented casino and gaming technology. In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL\u2122 print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine. A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nIncome\nCasino and Gaming: Revenue\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2017 of $3.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $3.6 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for 2016.\nOperating\nInventories - Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. We review net realizable value based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion, disposal and transportation, historical usage and estimates of future demand. Assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made, as necessary, to reflect changing market conditions. Based on these reviews, inventory write-downs are recorded, as necessary, to reflect estimated obsolescence, excess quantities and net realizable value. Should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence, additional write-downs of inventory could result in a charge to income.\nGoodwill\nTSG: Revenue generated by our TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges. A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our total net sales decreased 3% to approximately $54.6 million. See the table below for a breakdown of our sales by market:\nThe decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our U.S. distributor. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to McDonald's, increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal and the initial sales of our AccuDate XL terminal in 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 we completed the build-out of our European casino and gaming internal sales team and started selling directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end-user casino and gaming customers in Europe as we terminated our relationship with our worldwide casino and gaming distributor. As a result of this investment, international casino and gaming sales increased 81% in 2018 compared to 2017. During 2018, we also recognized the initial sale of our new Epic Edge ticket-in, ticket-out ( TITO\u201d) printer for a large domestic operator's upcoming new casino opening.\nIncome\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIncome (Loss). Operating income information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment. For our separately priced extended warranty, technical support for our restaurant solution terminals and maintenance agreements (including free one-year maintenance received by the customers upon completion of EPICENTRAL\u2122 installation) revenue is recognized over time as the customer receives the benefit. The transaction price from the maintenance services is recognized ratably over time, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer. For extended warranties, the transaction price is recognized ratably over the warranty period, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer.\nOperating\nGross\nDuring 2016 and 2017, under a prior repurchase program that was in place from February 25, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we purchased 499,843 shares of our common stock for $3.9 million at an average price of $7.86 per share. From January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 4,044,842 shares of common stock for $32.1 million, at an average price of $7.94 per share.\nEngineering, design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design, development and testing services, supplies and contracted software development expenses). Engineering, design and product development expenses increased $273 thousand, or 6%, in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering staff and increased expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets. We expect engineering, design and product development expenses in 2019 to be consistent with 2018.\n\nWe believe that our business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends during the past three years. However, inflation is still a factor in the worldwide economy and may increase the cost of purchasing products from our contract manufacturers in Asia, as well as the cost of certain raw materials, component parts and labor used in the production of our products. It also may increase our operating expenses, manufacturing overhead expenses and the cost to acquire or replace fixed assets. We have generally been able to maintain or improve our profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent, price increases, and we expect to be able to do the same during 2019. As such, we do not believe that inflation will have a significant impact on our business during 2019.\n * International sales do not include sales of products made to domestic distributors or other customers who in turn ship those products to international destinations. \nContractual Obligations\nExpenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nRestaurant solutions: Revenue from the restaurant solutions market includes sales of terminals that combine hardware and software in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and \"enjoy by\" date labels to help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-restaurant operations. A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nThe increase in Printrex printers was due to an 83% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers due to higher demand in 2017 compared to 2016 and a 149% increase in sales of medical and mobile printers primarily due to sales of our mobile printer to one customer.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nInternational POS automation and banking sales decreased due to lower sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald's during 2018 compared to 2017.\n\n \u25cf Accounts payable decreased $332 thousand, or 9%, due to the timing of inventory purchases in 2017 compared to 2018. \nTSG, which sells service, replacement parts and consumable products, including food safety labels, receipt paper, ribbons and inkjet cartridges, continues to offer a recurring revenue stream for the Company. TSG sales decreased 17% in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to unusually high sales of replacement parts to IGT for a legacy lottery printer in 2017. Although the installed base of our thermal lottery printers remains large, and lotteries continue to extend lottery contracts utilizing our existing hardware, including our printers, based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments, primarily from IGT for spare parts, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses decreased $358 thousand, or 5%, in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of sales commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ. These decreases were partially offset by the hiring of additional sales staff to replace our former exclusive worldwide distributor with a direct selling team for our casino and gaming sales in Europe. We expect selling and marketing expense to increase significantly in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the full year impact from the hiring of additional sales staff during the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as new investments to support our new suite of BOHA! software and hardware solutions.\nTaxes. We recorded an income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $1.0 million at an effective tax rate of 16.1%, compared to an income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $3.6 million at an effective tax rate of 52.6%. The effective tax rate in 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate in 2017 due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017. Additionally, the effective tax rate in 2017 was unusually high due to the initial impact of the Tax Reform Act as we recognized a provisional $1.3 million charge to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of revaluing our net deferred tax assets using the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. The Tax Reform Act significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Reform Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate effective January 1, 2018 and, as a result, reduced our statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2019 to be between 12% and 14%.\nThe decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by a 75% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers. We do not expect any future sales of these legacy products, as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018 and have shifted our focus to our newer products. These decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in domestic sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printers of 1% during 2018 compared to 2017, as sales rebounded to prior year, near-record levels during the second and third quarters of 2018. We expect sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 for McDonald's to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking printer revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a 23% decrease in sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's began to slow compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. Additionally, we experienced a 37% decline in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers in 2017 compared to 2016.\n\n\n \u25cf Inventories decreased $834 thousand, or 9%, due to the sell through of inventory on hand during 2017. \nIncome\nGross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations of our EPICENTRAL\u2122 print system. Gross profit increased $81 thousand, or less than 1%, and gross margin increased 170 basis points due primarily to a more favorable sales mix in 2018 compared to 2017. The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology driven solutions, as well as lower sales volume of lottery and POS printers, which carry lower margins than our other products.\nResource Sufficiency\n\nInterest. We\nbranded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies. Revenue in this market also includes sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n \u25cf Accounts receivable decreased $2.7 million, or 25%, due to the collection of past due receivables from 2017 sales made to our former international casino and gaming distributor. \nPOS automation and banking: A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\n\nAccounts\nOur sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations that IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. However, our lottery market sales are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for 2019 compared to 2018, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher-value, technology enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.\nOperating\n\nWe expect domestic and international casino and gaming sales in 2019 to be relatively consistent with the sales levels achieved during 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOperating\n \u25cf Accounts receivable increased $355 thousand, or 3% due to a longer than normal collection process related to sales made to our international casino and gaming distributor. \n \u25cf We recorded depreciation and amortization of $1.0 million and share-based compensation expense of $629 thousand. \nShareholders' Equity\nCompensation - We calculate share-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of share-based awards. The key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Prior to January 1, 2017, stock-based compensation expense included estimated effects of forfeitures. Upon adopting ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d, in 2017, an accounting policy election was made to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amended guidance requires that all tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement, rather than through equity. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. This ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase additional employee shares for tax withholding purposes without requiring liability accounting and clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee's behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation requirements\nCasino and gaming: A\nInternational restaurant solution terminals decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower sales to our Latin American and Canadian distributors.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and, in particular, any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years, and match this forecast against the basis differences, deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets. Although we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made.\nnet. We recorded other expense of $266 thousand in 2018 compared to $9 thousand in 2017. The additional expense was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our United Kingdom ( UK\u201d) subsidiary in 2018 compared to 2017. Going forward we may continue to experience more foreign exchange volatility as we increase our casino and gaming sales in Europe.\nResults of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year ended December 31, 2017\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to focus our efforts on sales execution and growing the revenue of our newer, value-added products and technologies. In addition, on March 4, 2019 we launched our exciting new line of products for the restaurant solution's market, the BOHA! branded suite of cloud-based applications and companion hardware solutions. The new BOHA! products are a suite of products proving a solution to help restaurants and food service operators of any size automate back-of-house operations.\n\n\nused $4.5 million of cash from financing activities during 2018 to pay dividends of $2.7 million to common shareholders, purchase $2 million of common stock for treasury and $265 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $416 thousand. During 2017, we used $1.9 million of cash from financing activities to pay cash dividends of $2.6 million to common shareholders, purchase $358 thousand of common stock for treasury and $23 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $1 million.\n \u25cf We reported a net income of $3.2 million. \nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nCash Flow\nSales of our casino and gaming products increased approximately 43% in 2018 compared to 2017. In our casino and gaming market, our focus lies primarily in supplying printers worldwide for use in slot machines at casinos and racetracks, as well as in other electronic gaming devices that print tickets or receipts. Additionally, we supplement these printer sales with revenue from EPICENTRAL\u2122, our promotional printing system that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and print them real time at the slot machine. The increase of casino and gaming printer sales is primarily due to increased domestic and international sales of our thermal casino printers of 20% and 143%, respectively. The increase in domestic thermal casino printers was driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs and a large order of replacement printers from a domestic casino operator. The increase in international thermal casino printer sales was due to the successful transition away from using our former exclusive worldwide distributor. Rather, we employed our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. Casino and gaming sales also increased due to a 58% increase in sales of our off-premise gaming printers.\nExpenses - Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):", "item_7_text": "\n\nImpact of Inflation\nSales of our Printrex branded printers include wide format, rack mounted and vehicle mounted thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we experienced an approximately 23% increase in Printrex product sales due primarily to the continued recovery of the worldwide oil and gas market that had been negatively impacted from multiple years of declining worldwide oil prices. Although we expect to see continued modest growth in the oil and gas markets during 2019, we do not anticipate significant contribution to total sales from our Printrex products as we shift our focus towards our higher value, technology enabled restaurant solution terminals and casino and gaming products.\nIn 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board's approval each quarter. Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017. Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $2.7 million or $0.36 per share and $2.6 million or $0.35 per share, in 2018 and 2017, respectively. On February 11, 2019, our Board of Directors approved the first quarter 2019 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about March 15, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2019.\nProfit. Gross profit information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\n \u25cf Accounts payable decreased $988 thousand, or 20%, due primarily to increased inventory purchases made towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 to support anticipated sales of our restaurant solutions terminals and subsequently paid in 2017. \nThe following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements. These items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are therefore based on our judgment. Please refer to Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies.\nInternationally, TSG revenue increased primarily due to a 134% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in 2018 compared to 2017, as sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers have increased upon the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers.\nEngineering, design and product development expenses decreased $122 thousand or 3%, due primarily to higher product development costs during 2016 related to the substantial completion of certain software development projects for our EPICENTRAL\u2122 software compared to 2017.\nInvesting activities: Our\nInternal cash generation together with currently available cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing facilities and an ability to access credit lines, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, treasury share repurchases, dividend payments and any increase in working capital that would be required to accommodate a higher level of business activity. We actively seek to expand by acquisition as well as through the growth of our current business. While a significant acquisition may require additional debt and/or equity financing, although no assurances can be given, we believe that we would be able to obtain additional financing based on our historical earnings performance.\nOverall, international sales decreased $4.1 million, or 35%, primarily driven by lower sales in the international casino and gaming market. This decrease was partially offset by a $1 million sales increase in our international lottery market during 2017.\nResults of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\n\nThe decrease in international lottery sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a sale of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in 2017 and no comparable sale occurring in 2018.\nCapital expenditures and additions to capitalized software for 2019 are expected to be approximately $1.3 million, primarily for software development for our new restaurant solutions BOHA! products, new product tooling, and new computer software and equipment purchases.\nfollowing significant factors primarily affected our cash provided by operating activities of $5.1 million in 2018 as compared to $5.9 million in 2017. During 2018:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n * International sales do not include sales of products made to domestic distributors or other customers who in turn ship those products to international destinations. \n\nOperating\n\nRestaurant solutions: A\nDuring 2017:\nWe maintain a credit facility (the TD Bank Credit Facility\u201d) with TD Bank N.A. ( TD Bank) which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line. On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022. Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets. We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line. The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.\nPurchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements, primarily of fully assembled printers, terminals and component part inventory.\nOur operating income increased by $1.6 million, or 31%, primarily due to a 570 basis point improvement in gross margin on a favorable product mix, partially offset by a 7% increase in operating expenses in 2017 compared to 2016.\nShare-Based\n\nThe decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to McDonald's. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our newer AccuDate XL2e terminal to three large corporate customers. We expect sales of our restaurant solutions products to increase in 2019 compared to 2018 following the launch of our new BOHA! cloud-based applications and hardware solutions in the first quarter of 2019. The new BOHA! suite of products is designed to provide back-of-house automation solutions to restaurant and foodservice operators.\nnet. We recorded other expense of $9 thousand in 2017 compared to $4 thousand in 2016. The change was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our UK subsidiary in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, we recorded a gain of $5 thousand on the disposal of fixed assets in 2016.\nOther,\nInternational restaurant solutions sales increased during 2018 compared to 2017 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 for McDonald's through our Canadian distributor.\n \u25cf Inventories increased $4.0 million, or 46%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming market and restaurant solutions market. \nOverview\nTaxes - In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, as well as net operating losses, tax credits and other carryforwards. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nSales for our lottery market and TransAct Services Group ( TSG\u201d) market decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to lower sales to International Gaming Technology and its subsidiaries ( IGT\u201d). TSG sales to IGT decreased due to lower sales of spare parts in the lottery market during 2018 compared to 2017. These sales declines were as expected as we are no longer focusing on the lottery markets. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments we expect lottery and TSG sales to continue to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\n\nOur sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue.\nThe increase in international sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to a 143% increase of thermal casino printer sales. These increases were due to the success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor whose contract ended at the end of 2017 and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. These increases were partially offset by a 5% decrease in international sales of off-premise gaming printers.\n\nThe increase in domestic revenue from TSG was due primarily to a 108% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher demand for spare parts in the lottery market in 2017. The increase, to a lesser extent, was also due to a 12% increase in project-oriented testing services that occurred in 2017 but did not occur to the same extent in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-Printrex consumables, largely for legacy POS and banking printers in 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as price protection, reserves for returns and other allowances, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value\u201d method or the most likely amount\u201d method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company's judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.\nInterest. We\nWarranty - We generally warrant our products for up to 24 months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded. Estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs. If actual future product repair rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates, adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made.\nProfit. Gross profit information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nFor a majority of our revenue, which consists of printers, terminals, consumables, and replacement parts, the Company recognizes revenue as of a point of time. The transaction price is recognized upon shipment of the order when control of the goods is transferred to the customer and at the time the performance obligation is fulfilled. We also sell a software solution, EPICENTRAL\u2122, that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real-time at the slot machine. EPICENTRALTM is primarily comprised of both a software component, which is licensed to the customer, and a hardware component. EPICENTRAL\u2122 software and hardware are integrated to deliver the system's full functionality. The transaction prices from EPICENTRAL\u2122 software license and hardware are recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer when control of the license is transferred to the customer. For out-of-warranty repairs, the transaction price is recognized after the repair work is completed and the printer or terminal is returned to the customer, as control of the product is transferred to the customer and our performance obligation is completed.\nExpenses - General and Administrative. General and administrative information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2018 of $5.4 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to $3.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for 2017.\nSelling and marketing expenses increased $654 thousand, or 10%, as we completed the build-out of our internal infrastructure, including the hiring of a direct sales force and implementation of a direct marketing campaign dedicated to the restaurant solutions market in 2017.\n \u25cf Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $186 thousand, or 5%, due primarily to a decrease in our accrued incentive compensation. \n\nGross\nNet Sales. Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nand Intangible Assets - We acquire businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with ASC 350-20 Goodwill\u201d, acquired goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change, which indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. Factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate. We reported $2.6 million of goodwill and $797 thousand of unamortized definite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2018. We have determined that no goodwill or intangible asset impairment has occurred and the fair value of goodwill was substantially higher than our carrying value based on our assessment as of December 31, 2018 when the impairment review is performed.\n\n\n\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows generated from operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.\nsummary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nReceivable - We have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts, including: credit reviews of all new customer accounts; ongoing credit evaluations of current customers; credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information; and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current creditworthiness. We also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2018 was $205 thousand, or 2.5% of outstanding accounts receivable, which we believe is appropriate considering the overall quality of our accounts receivable. Although credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established, there is no assurance that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience.\nOperating Expenses - Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nOperating\nShareholder Dividend Payments\nLottery: Revenue\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.\nThe increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to 26% higher sales of our thermal casino printers due mainly to market share gain, including higher sales to our OEMs to support two new casino openings. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in domestic EPICENTRAL\u2122 software sales of 34%. We completed two EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations in both 2017 and 2016, however in 2017 our installations consisted of one full-feature version of EPICENTRAL\u2122 and our first EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE version compared to two full-feature versions of EPICENTRAL\u2122 in 2016. Our EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE software is offered at a lower price compared to our full-feature version of EPICENTRAL\u2122.\n\ncapital expenditures, including capitalized software costs, were $1.5 million and $1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Expenditures in the 2018 period were primarily for computer and networking equipment and furniture and fixtures purchases related to investments made in our UK facility to support the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end-user casino and gaming customers. To a lesser extent, expenditures in the 2018 period included computer and networking equipment for our U.S. operations and leasehold improvements made at our Las Vegas facility. Expenditures in 2017 were primarily comprised of computer and networking equipment, new product tooling equipment and, to a lesser extent, leasehold improvements at our Ithaca, New York facility to upgrade to LED lighting.\nsummary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTaxes. In 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $3.6 million at an effective tax rate of 52.6% compared to an income tax provision in 2016 of $1.6 million at an effective tax rate of 30.0%. The effective tax rate in 2017 was negatively impacted by the passage of the Tax Reform Act. As a result of the reduction of our U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $1.3 million charge to income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nPrintrex: Printrex\nThe increase in Printrex sales in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted from a 57% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers due to a continued recovery in the oil and gas market. This increase was partially offset by 87% lower sales of domestic and international medical and mobile printers in 2018 compared to 2017. We expect total Printrex sales to increase slightly in 2019 compared to 2018, as we expect oil and gas sales to continue to increase. However, we do not expect any future medical and mobile printer sales, as we exited this market at the end of 2018 in order to focus on our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.\nExpenses - General and Administrative. General and administrative information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nOperating\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Among other things this provision prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity's financial statements. It also requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if, as of the balance sheet reporting date, it is more likely than not\u201d (i.e., more than a 50% likelihood) that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits. When making this assessment, management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information. The accounting guidance also clarifies the method of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a company's income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of the Tax Reform Act.\nAs of December 31, 2018, undrawn commitments under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.\nOther,\nNet Sales. Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\n\n \u25cf Deferred income tax provision increased $1.1 million largely due to a $1.3 million charge to income tax expense in 2017 to revalue our net deferred tax asset due to the Tax Reform Act. \nOperationally, our gross margin reached 49% in 2018, an increase of 170 basis points from 2017, representing the highest gross margin we have reported for a full year. We believe gross margin will continue at similar levels in 2019 as our newer, technology-enabled products continue to grow and become a larger portion of our overall sales. In 2018, although operating income decreased slightly by less than 1%, we achieved operating margin of 12.4% compared to 12.1% in 2017 due to our improved gross margin that was offset by slightly higher operating expenses primarily to support our two high growth markets--restaurant solutions and casino and gaming. During 2019, we expect higher operating expenses compared to 2018, due to the full year impact of the investments made during 2018, as well as new investments, in selling and marketing for these two high growth markets\nIncome. Operating income information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nPOS automation and banking: Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal printers used primarily by quick serve restaurants located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels. In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations. A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nOn March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program. Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. From the start of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program on March 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, we repurchased 156,410 shares of our common stock for approximately $2 million at an average price per share of $12.79.\nShareholders' equity increased $1.6 million to $27.6 million at December 31, 2018 from $26 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to net income of $5.4 million, as well as $148 thousand from the issuance of 96,615 shares of common stock related to employee stock awards, net of relinquishments and share-based compensation expense related to stock awards of $629 thousand. These increases were partially offset by our payment of $2.7 million in dividends and the purchase of 156,410 shares of treasury stock for $2 million.\nrecorded net interest expense of $27 thousand in 2018 compared to $33 thousand in 2017.\nNet sales for 2017 decreased $924 thousand, or 2%, from 2016. Printer and terminal sales volume decreased by 13% to approximately 150 thousand units, driven primarily by a 25% and 13% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and casino and gaming market, respectively and, to a lesser extent a 3% decrease in the lottery market and 13% decrease in the restaurant solutions market. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales volume of 112% in the Printrex market. The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to decreased volume of POS automation and banking printers sold in 2017, which carry lower prices than our other products.\n \u25cf We recorded depreciation and amortization of $1.1 million and share-based compensation expense of $609 thousand. \nThe TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens. We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at December 31, 2018.\nFinancing activities: We\nExpenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\n \u25cf Accrued liabilities and other liabilities increased $1.1 million, or 35%, due primarily to an increase in our accrued incentive compensation. \nDuring 2018 our cash balance decreased $816 thousand, or 15%, from December 31, 2017 and we returned a substantial portion of our cash flow to shareholders in the form of $2.7 million of cash dividends paid to common shareholders and $2 million of repurchases of our common stock. Even after funding these items and our capital expenditures, we still ended 2018 with $4.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $2.9 million was held by our UK subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.\nWhen there is more than one performance obligation in a customer arrangement, the Company typically uses the standalone selling price\u201d method to determine the transaction price to allocate to each performance obligation. The Company sells the performance obligations separately and has established standalone selling prices for its products and services. In the case of an overall price discount, the discount is applied to each performance obligation proportionately based on standalone selling price. To determine the standalone selling price for initial EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations, the Company uses the adjusted market assessment approach.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while other contracts contain multiple performance obligations (most commonly when contracts include product and extended warranties). A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price.\nOperating activities: The\n\nPrintrex: A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nThe decrease in domestic revenue from TSG in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to lower sales of replacement parts, non-Printrex consumable products and service revenue. Replacement part sales decreased 36% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. Non-Printrex consumables sales declined 10% due to lower sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers, as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018. Service revenue declined 10% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to paper testing sales that occurred in 2017 but did not repeat in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by increased AccuDate label sales which more than quadrupled in 2018 compared 2017. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments for replacement parts, primarily from IGT, for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect both Balance Sheet items and Statement of Income categories. Such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances. We evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates. Actual results may differ from the original estimates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $717 thousand, or 10%, due primarily to higher incentive compensation expenses incurred in 2017 compared to 2016 and higher recruiting expenses related to the expansion of our sales staff for our restaurant solutions market and European casino and gaming market.\nCredit Facility and Borrowings\nRevenue Recognition - ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and its related amendments (collectively, ASC 606) are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. This ASU is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies in revenue requirements; providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or modified retrospective approach to adopt the amended guidance. We adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 and elected the modified retrospective approach. The results for periods before 2018 were not adjusted for the new standard and there was no cumulative effect for the change in accounting at the date of adoption.\nTSG: A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nWe reported net income of $5.4 million and net income per diluted share of $0.70 for 2018, compared to $3.2 million and net income per diluted share of $0.42 for 2017. In terms of cash flow for 2018, we experienced a very strong year, generating $5.1 million of cash from operating activities. We also returned $4.7 million to our shareholders in the form of $2 million for treasury share repurchases and $2.7 million for cash dividends. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 million and no debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018.\nThe increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due primarily to a 20% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer in 2018 compared to 2017, driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs and a large order from a domestic casino operator for replacement printers. Domestic sales also increased due to a significant sale of our off-premise gaming printers to an OEM that we don't expect to reoccur in 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we also sold our first order of our Epic Edge, our new thermal TITO casino printer, to a large domestic operator in connection with its upcoming casino opening. Sales of EPICENTRAL\u2122 software during 2018 were comparable with our 2017 EPICENTRAL\u2122 sales as we completed two new installations during both 2018 and 2017. Sales of EPICENTRAL\u2122 are project based, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nNet sales for 2018 decreased $1.7 million, or approximately 3%, from 2017. Printer and terminal sales volume decreased by 5% to approximately 142,000 units, driven primarily by a 71% decrease in unit volume from the lottery market and, to a lesser extent, a 6% and 18% decrease in the POS automation and banking market and restaurant solutions market, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales volume of 44% in the casino and gaming market. Although unit volume decreased during 2018 compared to 2017, the average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 7% during 2018 compared to 2017, due primarily to the decreased volume of lottery printers, which carry lower prices than our other products.\nInternational sales increased $3.5 million, or 46%, primarily driven by 81% higher international sales in the casino and gaming market. This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million sales decrease in our international lottery market during 2018 compared to 2017.\n \u25cf We reported a net income of $5.4 million. \nLottery: A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nInternational lottery sales increased due to sales of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in 2017 and no comparable sales occurring in 2016.\nSales of our POS automation and banking products decreased 8% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. In the POS market, we focus primarily on supplying printers that print receipts or linerless labels for customers in the restaurant and quick serve markets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the decline in sales of our POS automation and banking printers was primarily driven by a 75% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers as we exit these markets. In the banking market, we had focused mainly on supplying printers for use in bank teller stations at banks and financial institutions primarily in the U.S. As we continue to shift our focus to our newer products, we do not expect any future sales of these legacy products, as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018. POS automation and banking sales also decreased, although to a lesser extent, due to lower sales of our Ithaca 9000 printers during 2018 compared to the record sales levels of the Ithaca 9000 in 2017.\nInternational casino and gaming printer sales declined in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a 46% decrease in international sales of our thermal casino printers in Europe, Asia and Australia, as well as a 46% decrease in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to our former exclusive worldwide distributor in Europe and Australia. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. International EPICENTRAL\u2122 software sales also declined 79% as we completed no international EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations in 2017 compared to one completed international installation in 2016.\nrecorded net interest expense of $33 thousand in 2017 compared to $26 thousand in 2016.\nSales of our restaurant solutions products decreased approximately 4% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. In the restaurant solutions market, we continue to focus on providing terminals that print food rotational date and nutritional labels to help restaurants and other food service establishments effectively manage food rotation and safety. The decrease in restaurant solutions sales resulted from lower sales of our AccuDate\u2122 9700 terminal due to lower sales to McDonald's. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our newer AccuDate XL2e terminal to three large corporate customers. In 2019, we intend to focus on developing and selling our new BOHA! cloud-based SaaS applications and hardware solutions business.\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resources and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company. General and administrative expenses increased $221 thousand, or 3%, in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to increased legal expenses and increased administrative expenses related to the expansion of our restaurant solutions sales staff and transitioning to a direct selling model for the casino and gaming market in Europe. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense in 2018 compared to 2017. We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher incentive compensation and additional investment to support restaurant solutions.\nStock Repurchase Program\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, total lottery printer sales decreased approximately 69% due primarily to lower sales to IGT. Domestic lottery sales decreased 65% in 2018 compared to 2017. International lottery sales decreased $1.1 million due to a sale to IGT in 2017 for the Canadian lottery and no comparable sales in 2018. Our sales to IGT each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for 2019 compared to 2018, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher-value, technology-enabled market for restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.\nGross profit increased $2.9 million, or 12%, and our gross margin improved 570 basis points to a record 47.3%. These increases were driven by a more favorable sales mix in 2017 compared to 2016, as our 2017 sales included a greater proportion of spare parts sales and a lower portion of sales of POS automation and banking printers.\nfrom the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to IGT and, to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, treasury share repurchases, dividend payments, access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.\nOur operating income decreased by $55 thousand, or 1%. Despite a sales decline of 3% our operating margin improved, increasing 30 basis points to 12.4% in 2018 compared to 12.1% in 2017, largely due to a 170 basis point increase in gross margin somewhat offset by a 1% increase in operating expenses.\nfrom the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals, and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide. Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments. Revenue from this market also includes royalties related to our patented casino and gaming technology. In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL\u2122 print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine. A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nIncome\nCasino and Gaming: Revenue\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2017 of $3.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $3.6 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for 2016.\nOperating\nInventories - Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. We review net realizable value based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion, disposal and transportation, historical usage and estimates of future demand. Assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made, as necessary, to reflect changing market conditions. Based on these reviews, inventory write-downs are recorded, as necessary, to reflect estimated obsolescence, excess quantities and net realizable value. Should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence, additional write-downs of inventory could result in a charge to income.\nGoodwill\nTSG: Revenue generated by our TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges. A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our total net sales decreased 3% to approximately $54.6 million. See the table below for a breakdown of our sales by market:\nThe decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our U.S. distributor. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to McDonald's, increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal and the initial sales of our AccuDate XL terminal in 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 we completed the build-out of our European casino and gaming internal sales team and started selling directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end-user casino and gaming customers in Europe as we terminated our relationship with our worldwide casino and gaming distributor. As a result of this investment, international casino and gaming sales increased 81% in 2018 compared to 2017. During 2018, we also recognized the initial sale of our new Epic Edge ticket-in, ticket-out ( TITO\u201d) printer for a large domestic operator's upcoming new casino opening.\nIncome\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIncome (Loss). Operating income information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment. For our separately priced extended warranty, technical support for our restaurant solution terminals and maintenance agreements (including free one-year maintenance received by the customers upon completion of EPICENTRAL\u2122 installation) revenue is recognized over time as the customer receives the benefit. The transaction price from the maintenance services is recognized ratably over time, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer. For extended warranties, the transaction price is recognized ratably over the warranty period, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer.\nOperating\nGross\nDuring 2016 and 2017, under a prior repurchase program that was in place from February 25, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we purchased 499,843 shares of our common stock for $3.9 million at an average price of $7.86 per share. From January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 4,044,842 shares of common stock for $32.1 million, at an average price of $7.94 per share.\nEngineering, design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design, development and testing services, supplies and contracted software development expenses). Engineering, design and product development expenses increased $273 thousand, or 6%, in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering staff and increased expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets. We expect engineering, design and product development expenses in 2019 to be consistent with 2018.\n\nWe believe that our business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends during the past three years. However, inflation is still a factor in the worldwide economy and may increase the cost of purchasing products from our contract manufacturers in Asia, as well as the cost of certain raw materials, component parts and labor used in the production of our products. It also may increase our operating expenses, manufacturing overhead expenses and the cost to acquire or replace fixed assets. We have generally been able to maintain or improve our profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent, price increases, and we expect to be able to do the same during 2019. As such, we do not believe that inflation will have a significant impact on our business during 2019.\n * International sales do not include sales of products made to domestic distributors or other customers who in turn ship those products to international destinations. \nContractual Obligations\nExpenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nRestaurant solutions: Revenue from the restaurant solutions market includes sales of terminals that combine hardware and software in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and \"enjoy by\" date labels to help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-restaurant operations. A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nThe increase in Printrex printers was due to an 83% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers due to higher demand in 2017 compared to 2016 and a 149% increase in sales of medical and mobile printers primarily due to sales of our mobile printer to one customer.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nInternational POS automation and banking sales decreased due to lower sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald's during 2018 compared to 2017.\n\n \u25cf Accounts payable decreased $332 thousand, or 9%, due to the timing of inventory purchases in 2017 compared to 2018. \nTSG, which sells service, replacement parts and consumable products, including food safety labels, receipt paper, ribbons and inkjet cartridges, continues to offer a recurring revenue stream for the Company. TSG sales decreased 17% in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to unusually high sales of replacement parts to IGT for a legacy lottery printer in 2017. Although the installed base of our thermal lottery printers remains large, and lotteries continue to extend lottery contracts utilizing our existing hardware, including our printers, based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments, primarily from IGT for spare parts, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses decreased $358 thousand, or 5%, in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of sales commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ. These decreases were partially offset by the hiring of additional sales staff to replace our former exclusive worldwide distributor with a direct selling team for our casino and gaming sales in Europe. We expect selling and marketing expense to increase significantly in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the full year impact from the hiring of additional sales staff during the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as new investments to support our new suite of BOHA! software and hardware solutions.\nTaxes. We recorded an income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $1.0 million at an effective tax rate of 16.1%, compared to an income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $3.6 million at an effective tax rate of 52.6%. The effective tax rate in 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate in 2017 due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017. Additionally, the effective tax rate in 2017 was unusually high due to the initial impact of the Tax Reform Act as we recognized a provisional $1.3 million charge to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of revaluing our net deferred tax assets using the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. The Tax Reform Act significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Reform Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate effective January 1, 2018 and, as a result, reduced our statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2019 to be between 12% and 14%.\nThe decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by a 75% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers. We do not expect any future sales of these legacy products, as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018 and have shifted our focus to our newer products. These decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in domestic sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printers of 1% during 2018 compared to 2017, as sales rebounded to prior year, near-record levels during the second and third quarters of 2018. We expect sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 for McDonald's to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking printer revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a 23% decrease in sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's began to slow compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. Additionally, we experienced a 37% decline in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers in 2017 compared to 2016.\n\n\n \u25cf Inventories decreased $834 thousand, or 9%, due to the sell through of inventory on hand during 2017. \nIncome\nGross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations of our EPICENTRAL\u2122 print system. Gross profit increased $81 thousand, or less than 1%, and gross margin increased 170 basis points due primarily to a more favorable sales mix in 2018 compared to 2017. The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology driven solutions, as well as lower sales volume of lottery and POS printers, which carry lower margins than our other products.\nResource Sufficiency\n\nInterest. We\nbranded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies. Revenue in this market also includes sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n \u25cf Accounts receivable decreased $2.7 million, or 25%, due to the collection of past due receivables from 2017 sales made to our former international casino and gaming distributor. \nPOS automation and banking: A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\n\nAccounts\nOur sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations that IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. However, our lottery market sales are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for 2019 compared to 2018, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher-value, technology enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.\nOperating\n\nWe expect domestic and international casino and gaming sales in 2019 to be relatively consistent with the sales levels achieved during 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOperating\n \u25cf Accounts receivable increased $355 thousand, or 3% due to a longer than normal collection process related to sales made to our international casino and gaming distributor. \n \u25cf We recorded depreciation and amortization of $1.0 million and share-based compensation expense of $629 thousand. \nShareholders' Equity\nCompensation - We calculate share-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of share-based awards. The key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Prior to January 1, 2017, stock-based compensation expense included estimated effects of forfeitures. Upon adopting ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d, in 2017, an accounting policy election was made to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amended guidance requires that all tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement, rather than through equity. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. This ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase additional employee shares for tax withholding purposes without requiring liability accounting and clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee's behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation requirements\nCasino and gaming: A\nInternational restaurant solution terminals decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower sales to our Latin American and Canadian distributors.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and, in particular, any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years, and match this forecast against the basis differences, deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets. Although we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made.\nnet. We recorded other expense of $266 thousand in 2018 compared to $9 thousand in 2017. The additional expense was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our United Kingdom ( UK\u201d) subsidiary in 2018 compared to 2017. Going forward we may continue to experience more foreign exchange volatility as we increase our casino and gaming sales in Europe.\nResults of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year ended December 31, 2017\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to focus our efforts on sales execution and growing the revenue of our newer, value-added products and technologies. In addition, on March 4, 2019 we launched our exciting new line of products for the restaurant solution's market, the BOHA! branded suite of cloud-based applications and companion hardware solutions. The new BOHA! products are a suite of products proving a solution to help restaurants and food service operators of any size automate back-of-house operations.\n\n\nused $4.5 million of cash from financing activities during 2018 to pay dividends of $2.7 million to common shareholders, purchase $2 million of common stock for treasury and $265 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $416 thousand. During 2017, we used $1.9 million of cash from financing activities to pay cash dividends of $2.6 million to common shareholders, purchase $358 thousand of common stock for treasury and $23 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $1 million.\n \u25cf We reported a net income of $3.2 million. \nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nCash Flow\nSales of our casino and gaming products increased approximately 43% in 2018 compared to 2017. In our casino and gaming market, our focus lies primarily in supplying printers worldwide for use in slot machines at casinos and racetracks, as well as in other electronic gaming devices that print tickets or receipts. Additionally, we supplement these printer sales with revenue from EPICENTRAL\u2122, our promotional printing system that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and print them real time at the slot machine. The increase of casino and gaming printer sales is primarily due to increased domestic and international sales of our thermal casino printers of 20% and 143%, respectively. The increase in domestic thermal casino printers was driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs and a large order of replacement printers from a domestic casino operator. The increase in international thermal casino printer sales was due to the successful transition away from using our former exclusive worldwide distributor. Rather, we employed our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. Casino and gaming sales also increased due to a 58% increase in sales of our off-premise gaming printers.\nExpenses - Selling and Marketing.

This was driven by lower sales in the lottery and POS automation markets, partially offset by growth in the casino & gaming and Printrex markets.\n\n- Net income was $5.4 million or $0.70 per diluted share in 2018, compared to $3.2 million or $0.42 per diluted share in 2017. \n\n- The company returned $4.7 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2018.\n\nKey Results\n- Gross margin reached a record 49% in 2018, a 170 basis point improvement over 2017, due to a shift in sales mix towards higher value products.\n\n- Operating income decreased slightly by less than 1% in 2018 as the higher gross margin was offset by higher operating expenses.\n\nSegment Performance\n- Restaurant solutions sales decreased 4% in 2018 due to lower AccuDate terminal sales, partially offset by new AccuDate XL2e terminal sales. A new BOHA! product line was launched in early 2019.  \n\n- POS automation and banking sales decreased 8% primarily due to exiting the banking printer market and lower Ithaca 9000 printer sales.\n\n- Casino & gaming sales grew 43% driven by domestic and international thermal casino printer growth as well as growth in off-premise gaming printers.  \n\n- Lottery sales decreased 69% as the company shifts focus away from that market. \n\n- Printrex sales increased 23% primarily due to recovering oil & gas printer demand. Medical & mobile printer sales exited.\n\n- TSG sales decreased 17% largely due to lower legacy lottery printer parts sales. Further TSG sales decreases expected.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Strong cash flow from operations of $5.1 million in 2018. Returned $4.7 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. \n\n- Maintains revolving credit facility with no outstanding debt. Compliant with all loan covenants.\n\n- Sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to fund 2019 working capital and capital expenditure needs."}
