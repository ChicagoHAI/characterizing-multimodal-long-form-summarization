Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statement and notes thereto.\nManagement's Focus\nThe Company's focus is on ensuring that our quality, operational and cost performance are world class. As part of our efforts to position the Company for future success, we completed several key initiatives in 2017, including executing the Sustaining Amendment #30 and the 787 Amendment #25 with Boeing (referred to herein collectively as the Definitive Documentation\u201d), which secured pricing terms on our recurring Boeing programs into 2022. In addition, we focused on investments in technology and automation to reduce our internal costs, prepared for increasing production rates, and generated cash with disciplined cash deployment.\nAs we continue to position the Company for future success, our focus in 2018 will revolve around our operational execution with a focus on safety and quality while working to meet our customers' requirements for production rate changes. Additionally, we will focus on positioning ourselves for organic and inorganic growth within the commercial, defense, and fabrication markets. Considering the strong demand for commercial aircraft and the expected continued need for defense aircraft for the foreseeable future, both markets offer possibilities for growth. To help support our work on production rate increases and market growth, we will continue to focus on attracting, developing, and retaining a world-class team at our sites and remaining a trusted partner to our customers and suppliers.\nPrograms\nA350 XWB\nWe continue to support the A350 XWB program through two contracts we have with Airbus, a fuselage contract and a wing contract, both of which are segmented into a non-recurring design engineering phase and a recurring production phase. In addition, we support the development of the work scope for the design and tooling related to the -1000 derivative of the A350 XWB fuselage and wing contracts.\nThe Company has recorded several forward losses on the A350 XWB fuselage recurring program. In earlier stages of production, forward losses were driven by production inefficiencies, engineering changes to the aircraft design, and higher test and transportation costs. In 2016, the Company experienced various disruption and production inefficiencies that exceeded previous estimates, which resulted in forward loss charges. During 2017, the Company recorded an additional forward loss on the A350XWB program of $19.4 million primarily related to unfavorable exchange rate impacts on labor and non-labor costs and supplier claims.\nThe Company could record additional forward loss charges if there are further changes to revenue and cost estimates and/or if risks are not mitigated.\nB787 Program\nAs we continue on our second contract block on the B787 program, our performance for this program depends on our continued ability to achieve cost reductions in our manufacturing and support labor and supply chain. We have had several changes in estimates on the B787 program. Most recently, in 2017, Boeing and Spirit executed the 787 Amendment, which established pricing terms for the B787-8, -9, and -10 derivative models between line unit 501 and line unit 1405 and required the parties to negotiate pricing for B787 line units 1406 and beyond beginning 24 months prior to the scheduled delivery date for line unit 1405.\nAs a result of the expected completion of the 787 Amendment, which caused the Company to extend the current contract block ending at line unit 1003 to line unit 1405, the Company recorded a second quarter 2017 reach-forward loss $352.8 million on the B787 program. In the fourth quarter of 2017, favorable cost initiatives and benefits from absorption of fixed costs due to announced rate increases, resulted in a favorable change in estimate on the B787 program of $41.1 million.\nGoing forward, the B787 program has expected price step downs, which will require Spirit to substantially reduce its operational costs. If Spirit is unable to reduce its costs on the B787 program while successfully executing future rate increases, Spirit may record additional forward losses on the program.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to use estimates and assumptions. The results of these estimates form the basis for making\njudgments which may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the impacts of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventory, income taxes, financing obligations, warranties, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical accounting policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However, the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions, and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe application of these policies requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments to estimate the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nRevenues and Profit Recognition under Long-Term Contracts\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the contract method of accounting and records sales and profits on each contract in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, as further described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. In determining our profits and losses in accordance with this method, we are required to make significant assumptions regarding our future costs and revenues, as well as the estimated number of units to be manufactured under the contract and other variables. We continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and our most recent experience. If we make material changes to our assumptions, such as a reduction in the estimated number of units to be produced under the contract (which could be caused by emerging market trends or other factors), an increase in future production costs, or a change in the recoverability of increased design or production costs, we may experience negative cumulative catch-up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized. In some cases, we may recognize forward loss amounts. For a broader description of the various types of risks we face related to new and maturing programs, see Risk Factors.\u201d For discussion of the impacts of the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606 on revenues and profit recognition, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under the sub-heading New Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is impacted by, among other things, changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws in the countries in which we operate, and changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law legislation referred to as the TCJA. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), including amendments which significantly change the taxation of business entities.\nSome of the more significant changes that impact our Company included in the TCJA are reductions in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the ability to immediately expense certain property for specific tax years, the requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings as the U.S. transitions to a territorial tax system.\nThe staff of the SEC has recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of the TCJA, and, on December 22, 2017, issued guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB 118 clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), if information is not yet available or complete and provides for up to a one-year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting (the measurement period). SAB 118 describes three scenarios (or buckets\u201d) associated with a company's status of accounting for income tax reform: (1) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform, (2) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount, or (3) a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply ASC 740, based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the TCJA being enacted.\nAt December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the TCJA; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and continue to account for those items based on our existing accounting under ASC 740 and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment of the TCJA. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount of $28.7 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.\nProvisional amounts\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities: We re-measured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the TCJA and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. Included within our net deferred tax assets and liabilities are state income tax credits, which are recorded net of federal tax expense. With a lower federal income tax rate of 21%, the net value of these credits has increased. The provisional amount recorded related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset balance was a tax benefit recorded as a component of income tax from continuing operations of $16.2 million.\nForeign tax effects: The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We recorded a provisional amount for our one-time transition tax liability for all of our foreign operating subsidiaries, resulting in an increase in income tax expense of $44.9 million, including the anticipated state income tax effect. For federal income tax purposes, we will elect to pay this over a period of eight years as provided for in the TCJA. We have analyzed and calculated a provisional estimate for the cumulative post-1986 E&P for these foreign operating subsidiaries, the impact of certain expense allocations, the potential impact of any recapture of an Overall Foreign Loss balance and an assessment of potential foreign tax credits. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.\nWe continue to maintain that earnings of all foreign operating subsidiaries are indefinitely invested outside the U.S. on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings to fund working capital requirements, service existing obligations, and invest in efforts to secure future business. As a result, no additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities. We have completed analysis regarding potential withholding tax related to potential future dividends and anticipate that any associated withholding taxes would be immaterial based upon current law. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities (i.e., basis difference in excess of that subject to the one-time transition tax) is not practicable at this time.\nThe TCJA introduces a tax on global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d) for years ending after December 31, 2017. Our analysis and accounting for the effects of the GILTI provision is incomplete and an accounting policy on whether we will account for GILTI as a period expense or record deferred taxes for anticipated GILTI has not been made.\nIncome taxes are accounted for in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Tax rate changes impacting these assets and liabilities are recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs.\nA valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. When determining the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, we assess all available positive and negative evidence. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent the evidence may be objectively verified.\nWe record an income tax expense or benefit based on the net income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. These uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance on accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes. The final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management's original estimates made in determining the income tax provision. A change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods. We use the flow-through accounting method for tax credits. Under this method, tax credits reduce income tax expense.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain of our operating data:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td>

Other components which are part of the same aircraft shipsets could be produced or shipped in earlier or later accounting periods than the components used\nto measure production or shipset deliveries, which may result in slight variations in production or delivery quantities of the various shipset components in any given period.\nNet revenues by prime customer are as follows:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime Customer\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Boeing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,527.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,502.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,596.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Airbus\n</td> <td>1,123.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>992.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>760.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>332.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,983.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,792.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,643.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in Estimates\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we recognized total changes in estimates of ($296.1) million which includes net forward loss charges of ($327.3) million and favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to 2017 of $31.2 million. The net forward loss charges were primarily driven by the Boeing pricing negotiations including the effect of executing the Collective Resolution Memorandum of Understanding with Boeing (the MOU\u201d) and extending the current B787 contract block in the second quarter. Favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments for the periods prior to 2017 were primarily driven by productivity and efficiency improvements and favorable cost performance.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we recognized total changes in estimates of ($81.6) million, which includes net forward loss charges of ($118.2) million and favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to 2016 of $36.6 million. Net forward loss charges were primarily driven by various disruption and production inefficiencies related to achieving production rate increases on the A350 XWB fuselage program. Favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments for the periods prior to 2016 were primarily driven by productivity and efficiency improvements, favorable cost performance, mitigation of risk on maturing programs, and favorable pricing negotiations on a maturing program.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized total changes in estimates of $52.4 million, which includes favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to 2015 of $41.6 million and favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $10.8 million, which is net of forward loss charges of ($6.9) million. Favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments for the periods prior to 2015 and changes in estimates on loss programs were primarily driven by productivity and efficiency improvements, favorable cost performance, mitigation of risk, benefits from increased production rates related to the absorption of fixed costs, and favorable pricing negotiations on a maturing program. Forward loss charges were due to a production rate decrease on a mature program.\nThe Company is currently working on several programs, primarily the B787, A350 XWB, and BR725 programs, that carry risks associated with design responsibility, development of production tooling, production inefficiencies during the early phases of production, hiring and training of qualified personnel, increased capital and funding commitments, supplier performance, delivery schedules and unique customer requirements. The Company has previously recorded forward loss charges on these programs. If the risks related to these programs are not mitigated, then the Company could record additional forward loss charges.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Revenues. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $6,983.0 million, an increase of $190.1 million, or 3%, compared with net revenues of $6,792.9 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the B737, B787, A320, and A350 XWB programs, increased defense related activity, and higher revenues recognized on certain non-recurring Boeing programs, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B747 and B777, decreased GCS&S activity, lower revenue recognized on the B787 Program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, and the absence of a one-time customer claim settlement recorded in the first half of 2016. Approximately 95% of Spirit's net revenues in 2017 came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus.\nDeliveries to Boeing increased to 772 shipsets during 2017, compared to 756 shipsets delivered in the prior year, driven by production increases on the B737, B767, and B787 programs, partially offset by decreases on the B747 and B777 programs. Deliveries to Airbus increased to 791 shipsets during 2017, compared to 739 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by higher production of the A320 and A350 XWB programs, partially offset by decreased production on the A380 program.\nProduction deliveries of business/regional jet wing and wing components remained flat at 88 shipsets during both 2017 and 2016. In total, shipset deliveries increased 4% to 1,651 shipsets in 2017 compared to 1,583 shipsets in 2016.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $820.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $989.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by net forward loss charges recognized for the B787 Program in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the absence of forward loss charges recognized on the A350 XWB fuselage program during 2016.\nSG&A and Research and Development. SG&A expense was $28.0 million lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to expenses related to executive retirements and severance including stock compensation recognized in 2016. Research and development expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $7.4 million higher as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to more internal projects underway.\nImpact of Severe Weather Event. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $19.9 million charge related to the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, compared to $12.1 million recorded in the prior year. The impact of Hurricane Matthew caused the Company's Kinston, North Carolina site operations to temporarily shut down during the fourth quarter of 2016 with carryover effects into 2017.\nOperating Income. Operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $569.1 million, which was $156.0 million lower than operating income of $725.1 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily the result of the B787 net forward loss charges recognized during the second quarter of 2017.\nInterest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization. Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 includes $36.3 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $3.5 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, compared to $38.0 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $19.3 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount for the prior year. During 2016, we recognized $15.8 million in interest expense for the write-down of deferred financing costs, original issue discount and third party fees, and a call premium resulting from the financing activities that occurred during the second quarter of 2016, which included the amendment and restatement of our credit facility and redemption of our senior notes due in 2020 using proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes due in 2026.\nOther (Expense) Income, net. Other income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $7.2 million, compared to other expense of $7.3 million for the same period in the prior year. Other expense during 2016 was primarily driven by foreign exchange rate losses as the British Pound value weakened against the U.S. Dollar.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was $180.0 million compared to $192.1 million for the prior year. The 2017 effective tax rate was 33.7% as compared to 29.1% for 2016. The difference in the effective tax rate recorded for 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily related to higher benefit from foreign rates less than the U.S. rate and incremental federal research tax credits in 2017, offset by the provisional tax impacts recorded in 2017 due to the signing of the TCJA in December 2017. The provisional amounts include the one-time transition tax for all of our operating foreign subsidiaries and the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset balance. The decrease from the U.S. statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to the inclusion of the tax effects of foreign rates less than the U.S. rate, the re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax asset balance, the U.S. qualified domestic production activities deduction, and the generation of state income tax credits offset by the one-time transition tax for all of our operating foreign subsidiaries.\nSegments.

Fuselage Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $3,730.8 million, an increase of $232.0 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the B737 and A350 XWB programs, increased revenue on certain non-recurring Boeing programs, and increased defense related work, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B777 program and decreased GCS&S activity. Fuselage Systems segment operating margins were 9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 13% for the same period in the prior year, with the decrease primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the B787 fuselage program. In 2017, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $4.0 million, as well as ($223.2) million of net forward loss charges. In comparison, during 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $13.6 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements, as well as ($133.4) million of net forward losses.\nPropulsion Systems. Propulsion Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,666.2 million, a decrease of $111.1 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower production deliveries on the B777 and B747 programs, decreased GCS&S activity, and lower net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, partially offset by higher deliveries on the B737 program and increased revenue on a non-recurring Boeing program. Propulsion Systems segment operating margins were 17% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 18% for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the B787 program. In 2017, the segment recorded favorable cumulative\ncatch-up adjustments of $3.8 million and net forward loss charges of ($40.2) million. In comparison, during 2016, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of ($0.4) million and favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $10.1 million.\nWing Systems. Wing Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,578.8 million, an increase of $70.1 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the B737, B787, A320, and A350 XWB programs and higher net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B777, B747, and A380 programs and the absence of a one-time claim settlement with a customer. Wing Systems segment operating margins were 13% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 15% for the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the B787 program. In 2017, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $23.4 million and net forward loss charges of ($63.9) million. In comparison, during 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $23.4 million driven by claim settlements with customers and productivity and efficiency improvements, as well as favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $5.1 million.\nAll Other. All Other segment net revenues consist of sundry sales of miscellaneous services, tooling contracts, and natural gas revenues from the Kansas Industrial Energy Supply Company ( KIESC\u201d a tenancy in common with other Wichita companies established to purchase natural gas where the Company is a major participant). In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, All Other segment net revenues were $7.2 million, a decrease of $0.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The All Other segment recorded 28% operating margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Revenues. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $6,792.9 million, an increase of $149.0 million, or 2%, compared with net revenues of $6,643.9 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the A350 XWB and B767, higher revenues recognized on certain nonrecurring Boeing programs and one-time claim settlements with customers, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B747 and B777 and lower revenue recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, all of which net to a $141.4 million increase in revenue. Approximately 96% of Spirit's net revenues in 2016 came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus.\nDeliveries to Boeing decreased to 756 shipsets during 2016, compared to 763 shipsets delivered in the prior year, as decreased production deliveries on the B747 and B777 offset increased production deliveries on the B767 and B787. Deliveries to Airbus increased by 17% to 739 shipsets during 2016, compared to 632 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by higher production of the A320 and A350 XWB programs. Production deliveries of business/regional jet wing and wing components increased to 88 shipsets during 2016, compared to 62 shipsets delivered in the prior year. In total, shipset deliveries increased 9% to 1,583 shipsets in 2016 compared to 1,457 shipsets in 2015.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $989.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $1,111.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the recognition of forward loss charges on the A350 XWB fuselage program during 2016.\nSG&A and Research and Development. SG&A expense was $7.5 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to expenses related to executive retirements and severance including stock compensation. Research and development expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $4.0 million lower, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to fewer internal projects underway.\nImpact of Severe Weather Event. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a $12.1 million charge against operating income related to the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, which caused the Company's Kinston, North Carolina site operations to temporarily shut down.\nOperating Income. Operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $725.1 million, which was $137.9 million lower than operating income of $863.0 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily the result of net forward loss charges recognized during the second quarter of 2016.\nInterest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization. Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 includes $38.0 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $19.3 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, compared to $45.8 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $6.9 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount for the prior year. During 2016, we recognized $15.8 million in interest expense for the write-down of deferred financing costs, original issue discount and third party fees, and a call premium resulting from the financing activities that occurred during the second quarter of 2016, which included the amendment and restatement of our senior credit agreement and redemption of our senior notes due in 2020 using proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes due in 2026. In March 2015, we entered into\nAmendment No. 5 to our prior credit agreement which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt charge of $3.6 million. Additionally, interest expense for 2016 reflects lower average interest rates on our term loan and bonds compared to the prior year.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $7.3 million, compared to $2.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Other expense, net during 2016 was primarily driven by foreign exchange rate losses as the British Pound value weakened against the U.S. Dollar.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, was $192.1 million compared to $20.6 million for the prior year. The 2016 effective tax rate was 29.1% as compared to 2.6% for 2015. The difference in the effective tax rate recorded for 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily related to the release of the valuation allowance on U.S. federal deferred tax assets in 2015. The decrease from the U.S. statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to the inclusion of the tax effects of the U.S. qualified domestic production activities deduction, foreign rates less than the U.S. rate, the generation of state income tax credits, excess tax benefits in respect of share-based compensation in the income tax provision and federal research tax credits.\nFuselage Systems. Fuselage Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $3,498.8 million, an increase of $51.8 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the A350 XWB and B767 and the absence of charges related to historical non-conformance claims, partially offset by lower net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement and lower production deliveries on the B747 and B777. Fuselage Systems segment operating margins were 13% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to 18% for the same period in the prior year, with the decrease primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the A350 XWB fuselage program. In 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $13.6 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements on mature programs, as well as ($133.4) million of net forward losses. In comparison, during 2015, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $16.1 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements on mature programs, as well as $8.7 million of favorable changes in estimates on loss programs.\nPropulsion Systems. Propulsion Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $1,777.3 million, an increase of $26.6 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue recognized on certain nonrecurring Boeing programs and increased production deliveries on the B767, partially offset by fewer production deliveries on the B747 and B777 and lower net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement. Propulsion Systems segment operating margins were 18% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to 22% for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower production deliveries on the B747, the favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments recorded during 2015, increased revenue from lower-margin programs and the absence of nonrecurring customer incentive payments recorded during 2015. In 2016, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of ($0.4) million and favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $10.1 million. In comparison, during 2015, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $22.8 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements on mature programs, as well as $2.4 million of favorable changes in estimates on loss programs.\nWing Systems. Wing Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $1,508.7 million, an increase of $71.0 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the A350 XWB and one-time claim settlements with customers, partially offset by lower B777 wing related activity and fewer production deliveries on the B747. Wing Systems segment operating margins were 15% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to 12% for the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by favorable labor and material cost performance. In 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $23.4 million driven by claim settlements with customers and productivity and efficiency improvements, as well as favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $5.1 million. In comparison, during 2015, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $2.7 million, partially offset by net forward loss charges of ($0.3) million.\nAll Other. All Other segment net revenues consist of sundry sales of miscellaneous services, tooling contracts and natural gas revenues from KIESC. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, All Other segment net revenues were $8.1 million, a decrease of $0.4 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The All Other segment recorded 20% operating margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary sources of our liquidity include cash on hand, cash flow from operations, which includes receivables from customers, and borrowings made available by the following:\nSenior Unsecured Credit Facility\nOn June 6, 2016, we entered into the senior unsecured Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among Spirit, as borrower, the Company, as parent guarantor, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents named therein (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement provides for a $650.0 revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d) and a $500.0 term loan A facility (the Term Loan\u201d). Each of the Revolver and the Term Loan has a maturity date of June 4, 2021, and each bears interest, at Spirit's option, at either LIBOR plus 1.5% or a defined base rate\u201d plus 0.50%, subject to adjustment to amounts between and including LIBOR plus 1.125% and LIBOR plus 2.0% (or amounts between and including base rate plus 0.125% and base rate plus 1.0%, as applicable) based on changes to Spirit's senior unsecured debt rating provided by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC and/or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. The principal obligations under the Term Loan are to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of $6.25 million, with the remaining balance due at maturity of the Term Loan. The A&R Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that provides Spirit with the option to increase the Revolver commitments and/or institute one or more additional term loans by an amount not to exceed $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the participation of the lenders. Spirit used the proceeds of the Term Loan, along with cash on hand, to pay off the outstanding amounts of the term loan under our prior credit agreement and to pay a portion of the fees and expenses payable in connection with the A&R Credit Agreement.\nOn September 22, 2017, the Company, the lenders, and the administrative agent entered into Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Credit Agreement, which made certain minor administrative changes to the A&R Credit Agreement to account for the Company's upcoming adoption of ASU 2014-09, among other things.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance of the Term Loan was $462.5 million and the carrying value was $460.7 million.\nThe A&R Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on indebtedness liens, types of business, acquisitions, sales or transfers of assets, payments of dividends, transactions with affiliates, change in control, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements.\nSenior Notes\n2022 Notes. In March 2014, the Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due March 15, 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) with interest payable, in cash in arrears, on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2014. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the 2022 Notes was $294.8 million.\n2026 Notes. In June 2016, the Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.850% Senior Notes due June 15, 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d) with interest payable, in cash in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the 2026 Notes was $297.2 million.\nFor additional information on our outstanding debt, please see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt.\nOther\nAdditionally, we may receive proceeds from asset sales and may seek to access the credit markets, if needed. In October 2017, the Company entered into an agreement (the Receivable Sales Agreement\u201d) to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to a third party financial institution. Transfers under this agreement are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from the Company's balance sheet. For additional information on the sale of receivables, please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounts Receivable, net.\nOur liquidity requirements are driven by our long-cycle business model. Our business model is comprised of four to six year non-recurring investment periods, which include design and development efforts, followed by recurring production, in most cases, through the life of the contract, which could extend beyond twenty years. The non-recurring investment periods require significant outflows of cash as we design the product, build tooling, purchase equipment, and build initial production inventories. These activities could be funded partially through customer advances and milestone payments, which are offset against revenue as production units are delivered in the case of customer advances, or recognized as revenue as milestones are achieved in the case of milestone payments. The remaining funds needed to support non-recurring programs come from predictable cash inflows from our mature programs that are in the recurring phase of the production cycle. The non-recurring investment period typically ends concurrently with initial deliveries of completed aircraft by our customers, which indicates that a program has entered into the recurring production phase. When a program reaches steady recurring production, it typically results in long-term generation of cash from operations. As part of our business model, we have continuously added new non-recurring programs, which are supported by mature programs that are in the steady recurring phase of the production cycle to promote growth.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $423.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Based on our planned levels of operations and our strong liquidity position, we currently expect that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and\nborrowings available under our A&R Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations, inventory growth, planned capital investments, research and development expenditures, and scheduled debt service payments for at least the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>469.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>788.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile net income\n</td> <td>241.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>283.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in working capital\n</td> <td>(23.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>470.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>572.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>716.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,289.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(272.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(253.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(357.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(580.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(718.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(351.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate change on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the period\n</td> <td>(275.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(259.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>579.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td>697.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>957.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>697.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>957.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\nOperating Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we had a net cash inflow of $572.7 million from operating activities, a decrease of $143.2 million, compared to a net cash inflow of $716.9 million for the prior year. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the repayment under B787 Amendment #25 of $236.0 million less certain adjustments to Boeing as a retroactive adjustments for payments that were based on interim pricing, partially offset by lower net tax payments in 2017. Net tax payments made during 2017 were $101.9 million, resulting in an increase in net cash of $89.5 million, compared to net tax payments of $191.4 million during the prior year.\nInvesting Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we had a net cash outflow of $272.8 million from investing activities, an increase in outflow of $19.4 million, compared to a net cash outflow of $253.4 million for the prior year. The increase in cash outflow was driven by higher investment in capital during 2017 to support increasing production rates.\nFinancing Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we had a net cash outflow of $580.9 million for financing activities, a decrease in outflow of $137.8 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $718.7 million for the same period in the prior year. During 2017, the Company repurchased 7.5 million shares of its class A common stock for $496.3 million, compared to the repurchase of 14.2 million shares of class A common stock for $649.6 million in 2016. During 2017, the Company paid cash dividends totaling $47.1 million to its stockholders of record. Additionally, during 2016, we entered into the A&R Credit Agreement and issued $300.0 million of 2026 Notes and used those proceeds along with cash on hand to repurchase $300.0 million of our senior notes due in 2020 pursuant to a tender offer and redemption.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\nOperating Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a net cash inflow of $716.9 million from operating activities, a decrease of $572.8 million, compared to a net cash inflow of $1,289.7 million for the prior year. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower cash receipts in 2016 and income tax payments during 2016 as compared to income tax refunds in 2015. In 2016, deferred revenue and advance payments from customers were lower by $290.3 million compared to 2015. Net tax payments made during 2016 were $191.4 million, a decrease in net cash provided of $261.1 million, compared to net tax refunds of $69.7 million received during the prior year.\nInvesting Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a net cash outflow of $253.4 million from investing activities, a decrease in outflow of $104.0 million, compared to a net cash outflow of $357.4 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash outflow was primarily driven by higher investment in capital during 2015 to support increasing production rates.\nFinancing Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a net cash outflow of $718.7 million for financing activities, an increase in outflow of $367.6 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $351.1 million for the same period in the prior year. During 2016, the Company repurchased 14.2 million shares of its class A common stock for $649.6 million, compared to the repurchase of 5.7 million shares of class A common stock for $300.0 million in 2015. Additionally, during 2016, we entered into the A&R Credit Agreement and issued $300.0 million of 2026 Notes and used those proceeds along with cash on hand to repurchase $300.0 million of our senior notes due in 2020 pursuant to a tender offer and redemption. In 2015, we entered into Amendment No. 5 to our senior secured Credit Agreement.\nFuture Cash Needs and Capital Spending\nOur primary future cash needs will consist of working capital, debt service, research and development, capital expenditures, potential share repurchases, dividend payments, and merger and acquisition or disposition activities. We expend significant capital as we undertake new programs, which begin in the non-recurring investment phase of our business model. In addition, we expend significant capital to meet increased production rates on certain mature and maturing programs, including the B737, B787, A320, and A350 XWB programs. In response to announced customer production rate increases, we are evaluating various plans to relieve capacity constraints. We also require capital to develop new technologies for the next generation of aircraft, which may not be funded by our customers. Capital expenditures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $273.1 million, as compared to $254.0 million for the same period in 2016, as we made a higher investment in capital in 2017 to support increasing production rates. We plan to fund future capital expenditures and cash requirements from cash on hand, cash generated by operations, customer cash advances, borrowings available under our A&R Credit Agreement, and proceeds from asset sales, if any.\nOn November 1, 2016, the Company announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $600.0 million of our class A common stock. On July 25, 2017, the Company increased the existing share repurchase program by up to an additional $400.0 million of our class A common stock, resulting in a total program authorization of $1.0 billion. On January 24, 2018, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the program of approximately $500 million. As a result, the total amount remaining in the authorization is approximately $1.0 billion.\nThe Company continues to pay quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.10 per share. The most recent dividend was declared by the Board on January 24, 2018, to be paid on April 9, 2018, to stockholders of record as of March 19, 2018.\nAdvances on the B787 Program. Boeing has made advance payments to Spirit under the B787 Agreement, which are required to be repaid to Boeing by way of offsets against the purchase price for future shipset deliveries. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of advance payments received by us from Boeing under the B787 Agreement and not yet repaid was approximately $331.8 million.\nContractual Obligations:\nThe

The amount of noncurrent U.S. tax payables outstanding at December 31, 2017 was $38.1 million.\nForeign Operations\nWe engage in business in various non-U.S. markets. As of December 31, 2017, we have facilities in the U.K., France, and Malaysia, a worldwide supplier base, and a repair center for the European and Middle-Eastern regions. We purchase certain components, assemblies, and materials that we use in our products from foreign suppliers and a portion of our products will be sold directly to foreign customers, including Airbus, or resold to foreign end-users (e.g., foreign airlines and militaries). In addition, we operate an assembly facility in Saint-Nazaire, France to receive and assemble center fuselage frame sections for the A350 XWB commercial aircraft from the facility in Kinston, North Carolina before they are shipped to Airbus.\nSpirit is party to a joint venture with Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company Limited ( HAECO\u201d), and its subsidiary, Taikoo Aircraft Engineering Company Limited ( TAECO\u201d), Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, and Cal-Asia to develop and implement a state-of-the-art composite and metal bond component repair station in the Asia-Pacific region. The service center is called Taikoo Spirit AeroSystems Composite Co. Ltd.\nCurrency fluctuations, tariffs and similar import limitations, price controls, tax reform, and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations. Other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation, nationalization, restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers and additional political and economic risks. In addition, the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact.\nSales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities with such governments' countries. Furthermore, the political, cultural and economic climate outside the U.S. may be unfavorable to our operations and growth strategy.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1,260.1 million, or 18% of total net revenues for the same period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1,142.8 million, or 17% of total net revenues for the same period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $934.9 million, or 14% of total net revenues for the same period.\nInflation\nA majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long-term contracts that set fixed unit prices. Some but not all of our contracts provide for price adjustment for inflation. The Sustaining Agreement and B787 Agreement, which together generate the significant majority of the Company's revenue, provide for price adjustments in the case of abnormal escalation\u201d based upon a formula referencing specified government price indicies. In addition, we typically consider expected inflation in determining proposed\npricing when we bid on new work. Although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through these protections, sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSpirit's contracts with suppliers currently provide for fixed pricing in U.S. dollars, while contracts with respect to our U.K. operations are denominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling or Euros. In some cases, our supplier arrangements contain inflationary adjustment provisions based on accepted industry indices, and we typically include an inflation component in estimating our supply costs. In addition, Spirit has long-term supply agreements for raw materials with most of its suppliers and for certain raw materials, Spirit is party to collective raw material sourcing contracts arranged through Boeing and Airbus (see", "item_7_truncated": " (2) See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Impact of Severe Weather Event. \nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>469.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>788.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile net income\n</td> <td>241.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>283.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in working capital\n</td> <td>(23.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>470.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>572.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>716.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,289.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(272.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(253.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(357.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(580.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(718.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(351.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate change on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the period\n</td> <td>(275.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(259.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>579.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td>697.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>957.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>697.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>957.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we recognized total changes in estimates of ($81.6) million, which includes net forward loss charges of ($118.2) million and favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to 2016 of $36.6 million. Net forward loss charges were primarily driven by various disruption and production inefficiencies related to achieving production rate increases on the A350 XWB fuselage program. Favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments for the periods prior to 2016 were primarily driven by productivity and efficiency improvements, favorable cost performance, mitigation of risk on maturing programs, and favorable pricing negotiations on a maturing program.\n (3) For 2017, includes charges of $1.8 million and $12.7 million, related to warranty reserve and charges for excess purchases and purchase commitments, respectively. For 2016, includes charges of $13.8 million and $23.6 related to warranty reserve and early retirement incentives, respectively, offset by $7.9 million for the settlement of historical claims with suppliers. For 2015, includes charges of $40.7 million, $0.8 million, and $6.4 million related to warranty reserve, reduction in workforce, and unallocated inventory write-offs, respectively.

The income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was $180.0 million compared to $192.1 million for the prior year. The 2017 effective tax rate was 33.7% as compared to 29.1% for 2016. The difference in the effective tax rate recorded for 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily related to higher benefit from foreign rates less than the U.S. rate and incremental federal research tax credits in 2017, offset by the provisional tax impacts recorded in 2017 due to the signing of the TCJA in December 2017. The provisional amounts include the one-time transition tax for all of our operating foreign subsidiaries and the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset balance. The decrease from the U.S. statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to the inclusion of the tax effects of foreign rates less than the U.S. rate, the re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax asset balance, the U.S. qualified domestic production activities deduction, and the generation of state income tax credits offset by the one-time transition tax for all of our operating foreign subsidiaries.\n_______________________________________\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $820.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $989.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by net forward loss charges recognized for the B787 Program in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the absence of forward loss charges recognized on the A350 XWB fuselage program during 2016.\n (2) The $6.7 million of unrecognized tax benefit liability for uncertain tax positions has been excluded from this table due to uncertainty involving the ultimate settlement period.

increased to 772 shipsets during 2017, compared to 756 shipsets delivered in the prior year, driven by production increases on the B737, B767, and B787 programs, partially offset by decreases on the B747 and B777 programs. Deliveries to Airbus increased to 791 shipsets during 2017, compared to 739 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by higher production of the A320 and A350 XWB programs, partially offset by decreased production on the A380 program.\nFinancing Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a net cash outflow of $718.7 million for financing activities, an increase in outflow of $367.6 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $351.1 million for the same period in the prior year. During 2016, the Company repurchased 14.2 million shares of its class A common stock for $649.6 million, compared to the repurchase of 5.7 million shares of class A common stock for $300.0 million in 2015. Additionally, during 2016, we entered into the A&R Credit Agreement and issued $300.0 million of 2026 Notes and used those proceeds along with cash on hand to repurchase $300.0 million of our senior notes due in 2020 pursuant to a tender offer and redemption.

Propulsion Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,666.2 million, a decrease of $111.1 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower production deliveries on the B777 and B747 programs, decreased GCS&S activity, and lower net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, partially offset by higher deliveries on the B737 program and increased revenue on a non-recurring Boeing program. Propulsion Systems segment operating margins were 17% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 18% for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the B787 program. In 2017, the segment recorded favorable cumulative\nThe Company is currently working on several programs, primarily the B787, A350 XWB, and BR725 programs, that carry risks associated with design responsibility, development of production tooling, production inefficiencies during the early phases of production, hiring and training of qualified personnel, increased capital and funding commitments, supplier performance, delivery schedules and unique customer requirements. The Company has previously recorded forward loss charges on these programs. If the risks related to these programs are not mitigated, then the Company could record additional forward loss charges.\nThe primary sources of our liquidity include cash on hand, cash flow from operations, which includes receivables from customers, and borrowings made available by the following:\nAll Other. All Other segment net revenues consist of sundry sales of miscellaneous services, tooling contracts, and natural gas revenues from the Kansas Industrial Energy Supply Company ( KIESC\u201d a tenancy in common with other Wichita companies established to purchase natural gas where the Company is a major participant). In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, All Other segment net revenues were $7.2 million, a decrease of $0.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The All Other segment recorded 28% operating margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we recognized total changes in estimates of ($296.1) million which includes net forward loss charges of ($327.3) million and favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to 2017 of $31.2 million. The net forward loss charges were primarily driven by the Boeing pricing negotiations including the effect of executing the Collective Resolution Memorandum of Understanding with Boeing (the MOU\u201d) and extending the current B787 contract block in the second quarter. Favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments for the periods prior to 2017 were primarily driven by productivity and efficiency improvements and favorable cost performance.\nGoing forward, the B787 program has expected price step downs, which will require Spirit to substantially reduce its operational costs. If Spirit is unable to reduce its costs on the B787 program while successfully executing future rate increases, Spirit may record additional forward losses on the program.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities with such governments' countries. Furthermore, the political, cultural and economic climate outside the U.S. may be unfavorable to our operations and growth strategy.\nThe Company's focus is on ensuring that our quality, operational and cost performance are world class. As part of our efforts to position the Company for future success, we completed several key initiatives in 2017, including executing the Sustaining Amendment #30 and the 787 Amendment #25 with Boeing (referred to herein collectively as the Definitive Documentation\u201d), which secured pricing terms on our recurring Boeing programs into 2022. In addition, we focused on investments in technology and automation to reduce our internal costs, prepared for increasing production rates, and generated cash with disciplined cash deployment.\nAs a result of the expected completion of the 787 Amendment, which caused the Company to extend the current contract block ending at line unit 1003 to line unit 1405, the Company recorded a second quarter 2017 reach-forward loss $352.8 million on the B787 program. In the fourth quarter of 2017, favorable cost initiatives and benefits from absorption of fixed costs due to announced rate increases, resulted in a favorable change in estimate on the B787 program of $41.1 million.\nFuture Cash Needs and Capital Spending\nInterest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization. Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 includes $36.3 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $3.5 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, compared to $38.0 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $19.3 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount for the prior year. During 2016, we recognized $15.8 million in interest expense for the write-down of deferred financing costs, original issue discount and third party fees, and a call premium resulting from the financing activities that occurred during the second quarter of 2016, which included the amendment and restatement of our credit facility and redemption of our senior notes due in 2020 using proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes due in 2026.\nWe continue to support the A350 XWB program through two contracts we have with Airbus, a fuselage contract and a wing contract, both of which are segmented into a non-recurring design engineering phase and a recurring production phase. In addition, we support the development of the work scope for the design and tooling related to the -1000 derivative of the A350 XWB fuselage and wing contracts.\n2022 Notes. In March 2014, the Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due March 15, 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) with interest payable, in cash in arrears, on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2014. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the 2022 Notes was $294.8 million.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $7.3 million, compared to $2.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Other expense, net during 2016 was primarily driven by foreign exchange rate losses as the British Pound value weakened against the U.S. Dollar.\nA valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. When determining the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, we assess all available positive and negative evidence. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent the evidence may be objectively verified.\nOur liquidity requirements are driven by our long-cycle business model. Our business model is comprised of four to six year non-recurring investment periods, which include design and development efforts, followed by recurring production, in most cases, through the life of the contract, which could extend beyond twenty years. The non-recurring investment periods require significant outflows of cash as we design the product, build tooling, purchase equipment, and build initial production inventories. These activities could be funded partially through customer advances and milestone payments, which are offset against revenue as production units are delivered in the case of customer advances, or recognized as revenue as milestones are achieved in the case of milestone payments. The remaining funds needed to support non-recurring programs come from predictable cash inflows from our mature programs that are in the recurring phase of the production cycle. The non-recurring investment period typically ends concurrently with initial deliveries of completed aircraft by our customers, which indicates that a program has entered into the recurring production phase. When a program reaches steady recurring production, it typically results in long-term generation of cash from operations. As part of our business model, we have continuously added new non-recurring programs, which are supported by mature programs that are in the steady recurring phase of the production cycle to promote growth.\nborrowings available under our A&R Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations, inventory growth, planned capital investments, research and development expenditures, and scheduled debt service payments for at least the next twelve months.\nNet Revenues. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $6,792.9 million, an increase of $149.0 million, or 2%, compared with net revenues of $6,643.9 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the A350 XWB and B767, higher revenues recognized on certain nonrecurring Boeing programs and one-time claim settlements with customers, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B747 and B777 and lower revenue recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, all of which net to a $141.4 million increase in revenue. Approximately 96% of Spirit's net revenues in 2016 came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus.\nThe staff of the SEC has recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of the TCJA, and, on December 22, 2017, issued guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB 118 clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), if information is not yet available or complete and provides for up to a one-year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting (the measurement period). SAB 118 describes three scenarios (or buckets\u201d) associated with a company's status of accounting for income tax reform: (1) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform, (2) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount, or (3) a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply ASC 740, based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the TCJA being enacted.\nInvesting Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a net cash outflow of $253.4 million from investing activities, a decrease in outflow of $104.0 million, compared to a net cash outflow of $357.4 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash outflow was primarily driven by higher investment in capital during 2015 to support increasing production rates.\nOther (Expense) Income, net. Other income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $7.2 million, compared to other expense of $7.3 million for the same period in the prior year. Other expense during 2016 was primarily driven by foreign exchange rate losses as the British Pound value weakened against the U.S. Dollar.\nNet Revenues. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $6,983.0 million, an increase of $190.1 million, or 3%, compared with net revenues of $6,792.9 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the B737, B787, A320, and A350 XWB programs, increased defense related activity, and higher revenues recognized on certain non-recurring Boeing programs, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B747 and B777, decreased GCS&S activity, lower revenue recognized on the B787 Program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, and the absence of a one-time customer claim settlement recorded in the first half of 2016. Approximately 95% of Spirit's net revenues in 2017 came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus.\nContractual Obligations:\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $989.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $1,111.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the recognition of forward loss charges on the A350 XWB fuselage program during 2016.\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\nProvisional amounts\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\n\nImpact of Severe Weather Event. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $19.9 million charge related to the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, compared to $12.1 million recorded in the prior year. The impact of Hurricane Matthew caused the Company's Kinston, North Carolina site operations to temporarily shut down during the fourth quarter of 2016 with carryover effects into 2017.\nThe Company could record additional forward loss charges if there are further changes to revenue and cost estimates and/or if risks are not mitigated.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $423.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Based on our planned levels of operations and our strong liquidity position, we currently expect that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and\nWe record an income tax expense or benefit based on the net income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. These uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance on accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes. The final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management's original estimates made in determining the income tax provision. A change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods. We use the flow-through accounting method for tax credits. Under this method, tax credits reduce income tax expense.\nProduction deliveries of business/regional jet wing and wing components remained flat at 88 shipsets during both 2017 and 2016. In total, shipset deliveries increased 4% to 1,651 shipsets in 2017 compared to 1,583 shipsets in 2016.\nOn September 22, 2017, the Company, the lenders, and the administrative agent entered into Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Credit Agreement, which made certain minor administrative changes to the A&R Credit Agreement to account for the Company's upcoming adoption of ASU 2014-09, among other things.\nNet revenues by prime customer are as follows:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDeliveries to Boeing decreased to 756 shipsets during 2016, compared to 763 shipsets delivered in the prior year, as decreased production deliveries on the B747 and B777 offset increased production deliveries on the B767 and B787. Deliveries to Airbus increased by 17% to 739 shipsets during 2016, compared to 632 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by higher production of the A320 and A350 XWB programs. Production deliveries of business/regional jet wing and wing components increased to 88 shipsets during 2016, compared to 62 shipsets delivered in the prior year. In total, shipset deliveries increased 9% to 1,583 shipsets in 2016 compared to 1,457 shipsets in 2015.\njudgments which may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the impacts of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventory, income taxes, financing obligations, warranties, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical accounting policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However, the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions, and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe application of these policies requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments to estimate the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nForeign tax effects: The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We recorded a provisional amount for our one-time transition tax liability for all of our foreign operating subsidiaries, resulting in an increase in income tax expense of $44.9 million, including the anticipated state income tax effect. For federal income tax purposes, we will elect to pay this over a period of eight years as provided for in the TCJA. We have analyzed and calculated a provisional estimate for the cumulative post-1986 E&P for these foreign operating subsidiaries, the impact of certain expense allocations, the potential impact of any recapture of an Overall Foreign Loss balance and an assessment of potential foreign tax credits. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.\n\nOur effective tax rate is impacted by, among other things, changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws in the countries in which we operate, and changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates.\n (1) Does not include repayment of $515.6 million of B787 advances or deferred revenue credits to Boeing, or $2.0 million of Airbus advances or deferred revenue credits, which are reflected in our balance sheet as short-term and long-term liabilities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Advance Payments and Deferred Revenue/Credits. \nCurrency fluctuations, tariffs and similar import limitations, price controls, tax reform, and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations. Other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation, nationalization, restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers and additional political and economic risks. In addition, the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, was $192.1 million compared to $20.6 million for the prior year. The 2016 effective tax rate was 29.1% as compared to 2.6% for 2015. The difference in the effective tax rate recorded for 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily related to the release of the valuation allowance on U.S. federal deferred tax assets in 2015. The decrease from the U.S. statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to the inclusion of the tax effects of the U.S. qualified domestic production activities deduction, foreign rates less than the U.S. rate, the generation of state income tax credits, excess tax benefits in respect of share-based compensation in the income tax provision and federal research tax credits.\nThe amount of current net U.S. and state tax receivables outstanding at December 31, 2017 was $27.1 million. The amount of noncurrent U.S. tax payables outstanding at December 31, 2017 was $38.1 million.\nSpirit's contracts with suppliers currently provide for fixed pricing in U.S. dollars, while contracts with respect to our U.K. operations are denominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling or Euros. In some cases, our supplier arrangements contain inflationary adjustment provisions based on accepted industry indices, and we typically include an inflation component in estimating our supply costs. In addition, Spirit has long-term supply agreements for raw materials with most of its suppliers and for certain raw materials, Spirit is party to collective raw material sourcing contracts arranged through Boeing and Airbus (see\n2026 Notes. In June 2016, the Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.850% Senior Notes due June 15, 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d) with interest payable, in cash in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the 2026 Notes was $297.2 million.\nSenior Notes\nThe A&R Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on indebtedness liens, types of business, acquisitions, sales or transfers of assets, payments of dividends, transactions with affiliates, change in control, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the contract method of accounting and records sales and profits on each contract in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, as further described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. In determining our profits and losses in accordance with this method, we are required to make significant assumptions regarding our future costs and revenues, as well as the estimated number of units to be manufactured under the contract and other variables. We continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and our most recent experience. If we make material changes to our assumptions, such as a reduction in the estimated number of units to be produced under the contract (which could be caused by emerging market trends or other factors), an increase in future production costs, or a change in the recoverability of increased design or production costs, we may experience negative cumulative catch-up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized. In some cases, we may recognize forward loss amounts. For a broader description of the various types of risks we face related to new and maturing programs, see Risk Factors.\u201d For discussion of the impacts of the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606 on revenues and profit recognition, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under the sub-heading New Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\n\n (2) See Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\u201d for detailed discussion of operating data. \nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statement and notes thereto.\nFuselage Systems. Fuselage Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $3,730.8 million, an increase of $232.0 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the B737 and A350 XWB programs, increased revenue on certain non-recurring Boeing programs, and increased defense related work, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B777 program and decreased GCS&S activity. Fuselage Systems segment operating margins were 9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 13% for the same period in the prior year, with the decrease primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the B787 fuselage program. In 2017, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $4.0 million, as well as ($223.2) million of net forward loss charges. In comparison, during 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $13.6 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements, as well as ($133.4) million of net forward losses.\nOperating Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we had a net cash inflow of $572.7 million from operating activities, a decrease of $143.2 million, compared to a net cash inflow of $716.9 million for the prior year. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the repayment under B787 Amendment #25 of $236.0 million less certain adjustments to Boeing as a retroactive adjustments for payments that were based on interim pricing, partially offset by lower net tax payments in 2017. Net tax payments made during 2017 were $101.9 million, resulting in an increase in net cash of $89.5 million, compared to net tax payments of $191.4 million during the prior year.\nThe TCJA introduces a tax on global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d) for years ending after December 31, 2017. Our analysis and accounting for the effects of the GILTI provision is incomplete and an accounting policy on whether we will account for GILTI as a period expense or record deferred taxes for anticipated GILTI has not been made.\nWing Systems. Wing Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $1,508.7 million, an increase of $71.0 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the A350 XWB and one-time claim settlements with customers, partially offset by lower B777 wing related activity and fewer production deliveries on the B747. Wing Systems segment operating margins were 15% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to 12% for the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by favorable labor and material cost performance. In 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $23.4 million driven by claim settlements with customers and productivity and efficiency improvements, as well as favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $5.1 million. In comparison, during 2015, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $2.7 million, partially offset by net forward loss charges of ($0.3) million.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\nAdditionally, we may receive proceeds from asset sales and may seek to access the credit markets, if needed. In October 2017, the Company entered into an agreement (the Receivable Sales Agreement\u201d) to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to a third party financial institution. Transfers under this agreement are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from the Company's balance sheet. For additional information on the sale of receivables, please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounts Receivable, net.\nInvesting Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we had a net cash outflow of $272.8 million from investing activities, an increase in outflow of $19.4 million, compared to a net cash outflow of $253.4 million for the prior year. The increase in cash outflow was driven by higher investment in capital during 2017 to support increasing production rates.\nA majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long-term contracts that set fixed unit prices. Some but not all of our contracts provide for price adjustment for inflation. The Sustaining Agreement and B787 Agreement, which together generate the significant majority of the Company's revenue, provide for price adjustments in the case of abnormal escalation\u201d based upon a formula referencing specified government price indicies. In addition, we typically consider expected inflation in determining proposed\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1,260.1 million, or 18% of total net revenues for the same period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1,142.8 million, or 17% of total net revenues for the same period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $934.9 million, or 14% of total net revenues for the same period.\nAt December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the TCJA; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and continue to account for those items based on our existing accounting under ASC 740 and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment of the TCJA. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount of $28.7 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.\nto measure production or shipset deliveries, which may result in slight variations in production or delivery quantities of the various shipset components in any given period.\nAs we continue to position the Company for future success, our focus in 2018 will revolve around our operational execution with a focus on safety and quality while working to meet our customers' requirements for production rate changes. Additionally, we will focus on positioning ourselves for organic and inorganic growth within the commercial, defense, and fabrication markets. Considering the strong demand for commercial aircraft and the expected continued need for defense aircraft for the foreseeable future, both markets offer possibilities for growth. To help support our work on production rate increases and market growth, we will continue to focus on attracting, developing, and retaining a world-class team at our sites and remaining a trusted partner to our customers and suppliers.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance of the Term Loan was $462.5 million and the carrying value was $460.7 million.\nOn June 6, 2016, we entered into the senior unsecured Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among Spirit, as borrower, the Company, as parent guarantor, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents named therein (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement provides for a $650.0 revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d) and a $500.0 term loan A facility (the Term Loan\u201d). Each of the Revolver and the Term Loan has a maturity date of June 4, 2021, and each bears interest, at Spirit's option, at either LIBOR plus 1.5% or a defined base rate\u201d plus 0.50%, subject to adjustment to amounts between and including LIBOR plus 1.125% and LIBOR plus 2.0% (or amounts between and including base rate plus 0.125% and base rate plus 1.0%, as applicable) based on changes to Spirit's senior unsecured debt rating provided by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC and/or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. The principal obligations under the Term Loan are to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of $6.25 million, with the remaining balance due at maturity of the Term Loan. The A&R Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that provides Spirit with the option to increase the Revolver commitments and/or institute one or more additional term loans by an amount not to exceed $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the participation of the lenders. Spirit used the proceeds of the Term Loan, along with cash on hand, to pay off the outstanding amounts of the term loan under our prior credit agreement and to pay a portion of the fees and expenses payable in connection with the A&R Credit Agreement.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law legislation referred to as the TCJA. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), including amendments which significantly change the taxation of business entities.\nResults of Operations\nFinancing Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we had a net cash outflow of $580.9 million for financing activities, a decrease in outflow of $137.8 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $718.7 million for the same period in the prior year. During 2017, the Company repurchased 7.5 million shares of its class A common stock for $496.3 million, compared to the repurchase of 14.2 million shares of class A common stock for $649.6 million in 2016. During 2017, the Company paid cash dividends totaling $47.1 million to its stockholders of record. Additionally, during 2016, we entered into the A&R Credit Agreement and issued $300.0 million of 2026 Notes and used those proceeds along with cash on hand to repurchase $300.0 million of our senior notes due in 2020 pursuant to a tender offer and redemption.\nOperating Income. Operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $569.1 million, which was $156.0 million lower than operating income of $725.1 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily the result of the B787 net forward loss charges recognized during the second quarter of 2017.\nWe engage in business in various non-U.S. markets. As of December 31, 2017, we have facilities in the U.K., France, and Malaysia, a worldwide supplier base, and a repair center for the European and Middle-Eastern regions. We purchase certain components, assemblies, and materials that we use in our products from foreign suppliers and a portion of our products will be sold directly to foreign customers, including Airbus, or resold to foreign end-users (e.g., foreign airlines and militaries). In addition, we operate an assembly facility in Saint-Nazaire, France to receive and assemble center fuselage frame sections for the A350 XWB commercial aircraft from the facility in Kinston, North Carolina before they are shipped to Airbus.\nSegments. The following table shows segment revenues and operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nPropulsion Systems. Propulsion Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $1,777.3 million, an increase of $26.6 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue recognized on certain nonrecurring Boeing programs and increased production deliveries on the B767, partially offset by fewer production deliveries on the B747 and B777 and lower net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement. Propulsion Systems segment operating margins were 18% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to 22% for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower production deliveries on the B747, the favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments recorded during 2015, increased revenue from lower-margin programs and the absence of nonrecurring customer incentive payments recorded during 2015. In 2016, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of ($0.4) million and favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $10.1 million. In comparison, during 2015, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $22.8 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements on mature programs, as well as $2.4 million of favorable changes in estimates on loss programs.\nWing Systems. Wing Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,578.8 million, an increase of $70.1 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the B737, B787, A320, and A350 XWB programs and higher net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B777, B747, and A380 programs and the absence of a one-time claim settlement with a customer. Wing Systems segment operating margins were 13% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 15% for the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the B787 program. In 2017, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $23.4 million and net forward loss charges of ($63.9) million. In comparison, during 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $23.4 million driven by claim settlements with customers and productivity and efficiency improvements, as well as favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $5.1 million.\nThe Company has recorded several forward losses on the A350 XWB fuselage recurring program. In earlier stages of production, forward losses were driven by production inefficiencies, engineering changes to the aircraft design, and higher test and transportation costs. In 2016, the Company experienced various disruption and production inefficiencies that exceeded previous estimates, which resulted in forward loss charges. During 2017, the Company recorded an additional forward loss on the A350XWB program of $19.4 million primarily related to unfavorable exchange rate impacts on labor and non-labor costs and supplier claims.\n (3) Interest on our Term Loan was calculated for all years using the three-month LIBOR yield curve as of December 31, 2017 plus applicable margin. \nOur primary future cash needs will consist of working capital, debt service, research and development, capital expenditures, potential share repurchases, dividend payments, and merger and acquisition or disposition activities. We expend significant capital as we undertake new programs, which begin in the non-recurring investment phase of our business model. In addition, we expend significant capital to meet increased production rates on certain mature and maturing programs, including the B737, B787, A320, and A350 XWB programs. In response to announced customer production rate increases, we are evaluating various plans to relieve capacity constraints. We also require capital to develop new technologies for the next generation of aircraft, which may not be funded by our customers. Capital expenditures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $273.1 million, as compared to $254.0 million for the same period in 2016, as we made a higher investment in capital in 2017 to support increasing production rates. We plan to fund future capital expenditures and cash requirements from cash on hand, cash generated by operations, customer cash advances, borrowings available under our A&R Credit Agreement, and proceeds from asset sales, if any.\nOther\nAs we continue on our second contract block on the B787 program, our performance for this program depends on our continued ability to achieve cost reductions in our manufacturing and support labor and supply chain. We have had several changes in estimates on the B787 program. Most recently, in 2017, Boeing and Spirit executed the 787 Amendment, which established pricing terms for the B787-8, -9, and -10 derivative models between line unit 501 and line unit 1405 and required the parties to negotiate pricing for B787 line units 1406 and beyond beginning 24 months prior to the scheduled delivery date for line unit 1405.\ncatch-up adjustments of $3.8 million and net forward loss charges of ($40.2) million. In comparison, during 2016, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of ($0.4) million and favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $10.1 million.\nOther than operating leases disclosed in the notes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017.\nAmendment No. 5 to our prior credit agreement which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt charge of $3.6 million. Additionally, interest expense for 2016 reflects lower average interest rates on our term loan and bonds compared to the prior year.\nChanges in Estimates\nOn November 1, 2016, the Company announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $600.0 million of our class A common stock. On July 25, 2017, the Company increased the existing share repurchase program by up to an additional $400.0 million of our class A common stock, resulting in a total program authorization of $1.0 billion. On January 24, 2018, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the program of approximately $500 million. As a result, the total amount remaining in the authorization is approximately $1.0 billion.\n (4) Provisional amount for our one-time transition tax liability for all of our operating foreign subsidiaries, which we will elect to pay over a period of eight years as provided for in the TCJA. The state income tax effect of the transition tax will be offset by state income tax credit carryforwards. \nSG&A and Research and Development. SG&A expense was $7.5 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to expenses related to executive retirements and severance including stock compensation. Research and development expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $4.0 million lower, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to fewer internal projects underway.\n (1) Inclusive of forward losses, changes in estimates on loss programs, and cumulative catch-up adjustments. These changes in estimates for the periods ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 are further detailed in the segment discussions below and in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Changes in Estimates. \nForeign Operations\nIncome taxes are accounted for in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Tax rate changes impacting these assets and liabilities are recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs.\n\nSpirit is party to a joint venture with Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company Limited ( HAECO\u201d), and its subsidiary, Taikoo Aircraft Engineering Company Limited ( TAECO\u201d), Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, and Cal-Asia to develop and implement a state-of-the-art composite and metal bond component repair station in the Asia-Pacific region. The service center is called Taikoo Spirit AeroSystems Composite Co. Ltd.\nPrograms\nA350 XWB\nOperating Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a net cash inflow of $716.9 million from operating activities, a decrease of $572.8 million, compared to a net cash inflow of $1,289.7 million for the prior year. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower cash receipts in 2016 and income tax payments during 2016 as compared to income tax refunds in 2015. In 2016, deferred revenue and advance payments from customers were lower by $290.3 million compared to 2015. Net tax payments made during 2016 were $191.4 million, a decrease in net cash provided of $261.1 million, compared to net tax refunds of $69.7 million received during the prior year.\n (1) See Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\u201d for detailed discussion of operating data. \nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized total changes in estimates of $52.4 million, which includes favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to 2015 of $41.6 million and favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $10.8 million, which is net of forward loss charges of ($6.9) million. Favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments for the periods prior to 2015 and changes in estimates on loss programs were primarily driven by productivity and efficiency improvements, favorable cost performance, mitigation of risk, benefits from increased production rates related to the absorption of fixed costs, and favorable pricing negotiations on a maturing program. Forward loss charges were due to a production rate decrease on a mature program.\nTax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities: We re-measured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the TCJA and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. Included within our net deferred tax assets and liabilities are state income tax credits, which are recorded net of federal tax expense. With a lower federal income tax rate of 21%, the net value of these credits has increased. The provisional amount recorded related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset balance was a tax benefit recorded as a component of income tax from continuing operations of $16.2 million.\nThe Company continues to pay quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.10 per share. The most recent dividend was declared by the Board on January 24, 2018, to be paid on April 9, 2018, to stockholders of record as of March 19, 2018.\nAdvances on the B787 Program. Boeing has made advance payments to Spirit under the B787 Agreement, which are required to be repaid to Boeing by way of offsets against the purchase price for future shipset deliveries. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of advance payments received by us from Boeing under the B787 Agreement and not yet repaid was approximately $331.8 million.\n_______________________________________\nWe continue to maintain that earnings of all foreign operating subsidiaries are indefinitely invested outside the U.S. on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings to fund working capital requirements, service existing obligations, and invest in efforts to secure future business. As a result, no additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities. We have completed analysis regarding potential withholding tax related to potential future dividends and anticipate that any associated withholding taxes would be immaterial based upon current law. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities (i.e., basis difference in excess of that subject to the one-time transition tax) is not practicable at this time.\nFor additional information on our outstanding debt, please see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt.\n_______________________________________\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\nSenior Unsecured Credit Facility\n\nOperating Income. Operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $725.1 million, which was $137.9 million lower than operating income of $863.0 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily the result of net forward loss charges recognized during the second quarter of 2016.\nSG&A and Research and Development. SG&A expense was $28.0 million lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to expenses related to executive retirements and severance including stock compensation recognized in 2016. Research and development expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $7.4 million higher as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to more internal projects underway.\nManagement's Focus\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain of our operating data:\nAll Other. All Other segment net revenues consist of sundry sales of miscellaneous services, tooling contracts and natural gas revenues from KIESC. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, All Other segment net revenues were $8.1 million, a decrease of $0.4 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The All Other segment recorded 20% operating margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\npricing when we bid on new work. Although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through these protections, sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRevenues and Profit Recognition under Long-Term Contracts\n (5) Purchase obligations represent computing, tooling, and property, plant and equipment commitments as of December 31, 2017.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSome of the more significant changes that impact our Company included in the TCJA are reductions in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the ability to immediately expense certain property for specific tax years, the requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings as the U.S. transitions to a territorial tax system.\nFuselage Systems. Fuselage Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $3,498.8 million, an increase of $51.8 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the A350 XWB and B767 and the absence of charges related to historical non-conformance claims, partially offset by lower net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement and lower production deliveries on the B747 and B777. Fuselage Systems segment operating margins were 13% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to 18% for the same period in the prior year, with the decrease primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the A350 XWB fuselage program. In 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $13.6 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements on mature programs, as well as ($133.4) million of net forward losses. In comparison, during 2015, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $16.1 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements on mature programs, as well as $8.7 million of favorable changes in estimates on loss programs.\nCash Flows", "item_7_text": " (2) See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Impact of Severe Weather Event. \nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we recognized total changes in estimates of ($81.6) million, which includes net forward loss charges of ($118.2) million and favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to 2016 of $36.6 million. Net forward loss charges were primarily driven by various disruption and production inefficiencies related to achieving production rate increases on the A350 XWB fuselage program. Favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments for the periods prior to 2016 were primarily driven by productivity and efficiency improvements, favorable cost performance, mitigation of risk on maturing programs, and favorable pricing negotiations on a maturing program.\n (3) For 2017, includes charges of $1.8 million and $12.7 million, related to warranty reserve and charges for excess purchases and purchase commitments, respectively. For 2016, includes charges of $13.8 million and $23.6 related to warranty reserve and early retirement incentives, respectively, offset by $7.9 million for the settlement of historical claims with suppliers. For 2015, includes charges of $40.7 million, $0.8 million, and $6.4 million related to warranty reserve, reduction in workforce, and unallocated inventory write-offs, respectively.  Fuselage Systems, Propulsion Systems, Wing Systems, and All Other represented approximately 53%, 24%, 23%, and less than 1%, respectively, of our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to use estimates and assumptions. The results of these estimates form the basis for making\nImpact of Severe Weather Event. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a $12.1 million charge against operating income related to the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, which caused the Company's Kinston, North Carolina site operations to temporarily shut down.\nInflation\nProvision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was $180.0 million compared to $192.1 million for the prior year. The 2017 effective tax rate was 33.7% as compared to 29.1% for 2016. The difference in the effective tax rate recorded for 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily related to higher benefit from foreign rates less than the U.S. rate and incremental federal research tax credits in 2017, offset by the provisional tax impacts recorded in 2017 due to the signing of the TCJA in December 2017. The provisional amounts include the one-time transition tax for all of our operating foreign subsidiaries and the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset balance. The decrease from the U.S. statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to the inclusion of the tax effects of foreign rates less than the U.S. rate, the re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax asset balance, the U.S. qualified domestic production activities deduction, and the generation of state income tax credits offset by the one-time transition tax for all of our operating foreign subsidiaries.\n_______________________________________\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $820.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $989.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by net forward loss charges recognized for the B787 Program in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the absence of forward loss charges recognized on the A350 XWB fuselage program during 2016.\n (2) The $6.7 million of unrecognized tax benefit liability for uncertain tax positions has been excluded from this table due to uncertainty involving the ultimate settlement period. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Income Taxes. \nComparative shipset deliveries by model are as follows:\n\nInterest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization. Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 includes $38.0 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $19.3 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, compared to $45.8 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $6.9 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount for the prior year. During 2016, we recognized $15.8 million in interest expense for the write-down of deferred financing costs, original issue discount and third party fees, and a call premium resulting from the financing activities that occurred during the second quarter of 2016, which included the amendment and restatement of our senior credit agreement and redemption of our senior notes due in 2020 using proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes due in 2026. In March 2015, we entered into\nB787 Program\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDeliveries to Boeing increased to 772 shipsets during 2017, compared to 756 shipsets delivered in the prior year, driven by production increases on the B737, B767, and B787 programs, partially offset by decreases on the B747 and B777 programs. Deliveries to Airbus increased to 791 shipsets during 2017, compared to 739 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by higher production of the A320 and A350 XWB programs, partially offset by decreased production on the A380 program.\nFinancing Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a net cash outflow of $718.7 million for financing activities, an increase in outflow of $367.6 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $351.1 million for the same period in the prior year. During 2016, the Company repurchased 14.2 million shares of its class A common stock for $649.6 million, compared to the repurchase of 5.7 million shares of class A common stock for $300.0 million in 2015. Additionally, during 2016, we entered into the A&R Credit Agreement and issued $300.0 million of 2026 Notes and used those proceeds along with cash on hand to repurchase $300.0 million of our senior notes due in 2020 pursuant to a tender offer and redemption. In 2015, we entered into Amendment No. 5 to our senior secured Credit Agreement.\nFor purposes of measuring production or shipset deliveries for Boeing aircraft in a given period, the term shipset\u201d refers to sets of structural fuselage components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period. For purposes of measuring production or shipset deliveries for Airbus and Business/Regional Jet aircraft in a given period, the term shipset\u201d refers to all structural aircraft components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period. For the purposes of measuring wing shipset deliveries, the term shipset\u201d refers to all wing components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period. Other components which are part of the same aircraft shipsets could be produced or shipped in earlier or later accounting periods than the components used\nPropulsion Systems. Propulsion Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,666.2 million, a decrease of $111.1 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower production deliveries on the B777 and B747 programs, decreased GCS&S activity, and lower net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, partially offset by higher deliveries on the B737 program and increased revenue on a non-recurring Boeing program. Propulsion Systems segment operating margins were 17% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 18% for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the B787 program. In 2017, the segment recorded favorable cumulative\nThe Company is currently working on several programs, primarily the B787, A350 XWB, and BR725 programs, that carry risks associated with design responsibility, development of production tooling, production inefficiencies during the early phases of production, hiring and training of qualified personnel, increased capital and funding commitments, supplier performance, delivery schedules and unique customer requirements. The Company has previously recorded forward loss charges on these programs. If the risks related to these programs are not mitigated, then the Company could record additional forward loss charges.\nThe primary sources of our liquidity include cash on hand, cash flow from operations, which includes receivables from customers, and borrowings made available by the following:\nAll Other. All Other segment net revenues consist of sundry sales of miscellaneous services, tooling contracts, and natural gas revenues from the Kansas Industrial Energy Supply Company ( KIESC\u201d a tenancy in common with other Wichita companies established to purchase natural gas where the Company is a major participant). In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, All Other segment net revenues were $7.2 million, a decrease of $0.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The All Other segment recorded 28% operating margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we recognized total changes in estimates of ($296.1) million which includes net forward loss charges of ($327.3) million and favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to 2017 of $31.2 million. The net forward loss charges were primarily driven by the Boeing pricing negotiations including the effect of executing the Collective Resolution Memorandum of Understanding with Boeing (the MOU\u201d) and extending the current B787 contract block in the second quarter. Favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments for the periods prior to 2017 were primarily driven by productivity and efficiency improvements and favorable cost performance.\nGoing forward, the B787 program has expected price step downs, which will require Spirit to substantially reduce its operational costs. If Spirit is unable to reduce its costs on the B787 program while successfully executing future rate increases, Spirit may record additional forward losses on the program.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities with such governments' countries. Furthermore, the political, cultural and economic climate outside the U.S. may be unfavorable to our operations and growth strategy.\nThe Company's focus is on ensuring that our quality, operational and cost performance are world class. As part of our efforts to position the Company for future success, we completed several key initiatives in 2017, including executing the Sustaining Amendment #30 and the 787 Amendment #25 with Boeing (referred to herein collectively as the Definitive Documentation\u201d), which secured pricing terms on our recurring Boeing programs into 2022. In addition, we focused on investments in technology and automation to reduce our internal costs, prepared for increasing production rates, and generated cash with disciplined cash deployment.\nAs a result of the expected completion of the 787 Amendment, which caused the Company to extend the current contract block ending at line unit 1003 to line unit 1405, the Company recorded a second quarter 2017 reach-forward loss $352.8 million on the B787 program. In the fourth quarter of 2017, favorable cost initiatives and benefits from absorption of fixed costs due to announced rate increases, resulted in a favorable change in estimate on the B787 program of $41.1 million.\nFuture Cash Needs and Capital Spending\nInterest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization. Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 includes $36.3 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $3.5 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, compared to $38.0 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $19.3 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount for the prior year. During 2016, we recognized $15.8 million in interest expense for the write-down of deferred financing costs, original issue discount and third party fees, and a call premium resulting from the financing activities that occurred during the second quarter of 2016, which included the amendment and restatement of our credit facility and redemption of our senior notes due in 2020 using proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes due in 2026.\nWe continue to support the A350 XWB program through two contracts we have with Airbus, a fuselage contract and a wing contract, both of which are segmented into a non-recurring design engineering phase and a recurring production phase. In addition, we support the development of the work scope for the design and tooling related to the -1000 derivative of the A350 XWB fuselage and wing contracts.\n2022 Notes. In March 2014, the Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due March 15, 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) with interest payable, in cash in arrears, on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2014. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the 2022 Notes was $294.8 million.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $7.3 million, compared to $2.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Other expense, net during 2016 was primarily driven by foreign exchange rate losses as the British Pound value weakened against the U.S. Dollar.\nA valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. When determining the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, we assess all available positive and negative evidence. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent the evidence may be objectively verified.\nOur liquidity requirements are driven by our long-cycle business model. Our business model is comprised of four to six year non-recurring investment periods, which include design and development efforts, followed by recurring production, in most cases, through the life of the contract, which could extend beyond twenty years. The non-recurring investment periods require significant outflows of cash as we design the product, build tooling, purchase equipment, and build initial production inventories. These activities could be funded partially through customer advances and milestone payments, which are offset against revenue as production units are delivered in the case of customer advances, or recognized as revenue as milestones are achieved in the case of milestone payments. The remaining funds needed to support non-recurring programs come from predictable cash inflows from our mature programs that are in the recurring phase of the production cycle. The non-recurring investment period typically ends concurrently with initial deliveries of completed aircraft by our customers, which indicates that a program has entered into the recurring production phase. When a program reaches steady recurring production, it typically results in long-term generation of cash from operations. As part of our business model, we have continuously added new non-recurring programs, which are supported by mature programs that are in the steady recurring phase of the production cycle to promote growth.\nborrowings available under our A&R Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations, inventory growth, planned capital investments, research and development expenditures, and scheduled debt service payments for at least the next twelve months.\nNet Revenues. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $6,792.9 million, an increase of $149.0 million, or 2%, compared with net revenues of $6,643.9 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the A350 XWB and B767, higher revenues recognized on certain nonrecurring Boeing programs and one-time claim settlements with customers, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B747 and B777 and lower revenue recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, all of which net to a $141.4 million increase in revenue. Approximately 96% of Spirit's net revenues in 2016 came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus.\nThe staff of the SEC has recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of the TCJA, and, on December 22, 2017, issued guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB 118 clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), if information is not yet available or complete and provides for up to a one-year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting (the measurement period). SAB 118 describes three scenarios (or buckets\u201d) associated with a company's status of accounting for income tax reform: (1) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform, (2) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount, or (3) a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply ASC 740, based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the TCJA being enacted.\nInvesting Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a net cash outflow of $253.4 million from investing activities, a decrease in outflow of $104.0 million, compared to a net cash outflow of $357.4 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash outflow was primarily driven by higher investment in capital during 2015 to support increasing production rates.\nOther (Expense) Income, net. Other income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $7.2 million, compared to other expense of $7.3 million for the same period in the prior year. Other expense during 2016 was primarily driven by foreign exchange rate losses as the British Pound value weakened against the U.S. Dollar.\nNet Revenues. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $6,983.0 million, an increase of $190.1 million, or 3%, compared with net revenues of $6,792.9 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the B737, B787, A320, and A350 XWB programs, increased defense related activity, and higher revenues recognized on certain non-recurring Boeing programs, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B747 and B777, decreased GCS&S activity, lower revenue recognized on the B787 Program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, and the absence of a one-time customer claim settlement recorded in the first half of 2016. Approximately 95% of Spirit's net revenues in 2017 came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus.\nContractual Obligations:\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $989.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $1,111.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the recognition of forward loss charges on the A350 XWB fuselage program during 2016.\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\nProvisional amounts\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\n\nImpact of Severe Weather Event. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $19.9 million charge related to the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, compared to $12.1 million recorded in the prior year. The impact of Hurricane Matthew caused the Company's Kinston, North Carolina site operations to temporarily shut down during the fourth quarter of 2016 with carryover effects into 2017.\nThe Company could record additional forward loss charges if there are further changes to revenue and cost estimates and/or if risks are not mitigated.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $423.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Based on our planned levels of operations and our strong liquidity position, we currently expect that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and\nWe record an income tax expense or benefit based on the net income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. These uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance on accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes. The final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management's original estimates made in determining the income tax provision. A change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods. We use the flow-through accounting method for tax credits. Under this method, tax credits reduce income tax expense.\nProduction deliveries of business/regional jet wing and wing components remained flat at 88 shipsets during both 2017 and 2016. In total, shipset deliveries increased 4% to 1,651 shipsets in 2017 compared to 1,583 shipsets in 2016.\nOn September 22, 2017, the Company, the lenders, and the administrative agent entered into Amendment No. 1 to the A&R Credit Agreement, which made certain minor administrative changes to the A&R Credit Agreement to account for the Company's upcoming adoption of ASU 2014-09, among other things.\nNet revenues by prime customer are as follows:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDeliveries to Boeing decreased to 756 shipsets during 2016, compared to 763 shipsets delivered in the prior year, as decreased production deliveries on the B747 and B777 offset increased production deliveries on the B767 and B787. Deliveries to Airbus increased by 17% to 739 shipsets during 2016, compared to 632 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by higher production of the A320 and A350 XWB programs. Production deliveries of business/regional jet wing and wing components increased to 88 shipsets during 2016, compared to 62 shipsets delivered in the prior year. In total, shipset deliveries increased 9% to 1,583 shipsets in 2016 compared to 1,457 shipsets in 2015.\njudgments which may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the impacts of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventory, income taxes, financing obligations, warranties, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical accounting policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However, the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions, and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe application of these policies requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments to estimate the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nForeign tax effects: The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We recorded a provisional amount for our one-time transition tax liability for all of our foreign operating subsidiaries, resulting in an increase in income tax expense of $44.9 million, including the anticipated state income tax effect. For federal income tax purposes, we will elect to pay this over a period of eight years as provided for in the TCJA. We have analyzed and calculated a provisional estimate for the cumulative post-1986 E&P for these foreign operating subsidiaries, the impact of certain expense allocations, the potential impact of any recapture of an Overall Foreign Loss balance and an assessment of potential foreign tax credits. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.\n\nOur effective tax rate is impacted by, among other things, changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws in the countries in which we operate, and changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates.\n (1) Does not include repayment of $515.6 million of B787 advances or deferred revenue credits to Boeing, or $2.0 million of Airbus advances or deferred revenue credits, which are reflected in our balance sheet as short-term and long-term liabilities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Advance Payments and Deferred Revenue/Credits. \nCurrency fluctuations, tariffs and similar import limitations, price controls, tax reform, and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations. Other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation, nationalization, restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers and additional political and economic risks. In addition, the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, was $192.1 million compared to $20.6 million for the prior year. The 2016 effective tax rate was 29.1% as compared to 2.6% for 2015. The difference in the effective tax rate recorded for 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily related to the release of the valuation allowance on U.S. federal deferred tax assets in 2015. The decrease from the U.S. statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to the inclusion of the tax effects of the U.S. qualified domestic production activities deduction, foreign rates less than the U.S. rate, the generation of state income tax credits, excess tax benefits in respect of share-based compensation in the income tax provision and federal research tax credits.\nThe amount of current net U.S. and state tax receivables outstanding at December 31, 2017 was $27.1 million. The amount of noncurrent U.S. tax payables outstanding at December 31, 2017 was $38.1 million.\nSpirit's contracts with suppliers currently provide for fixed pricing in U.S. dollars, while contracts with respect to our U.K. operations are denominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling or Euros. In some cases, our supplier arrangements contain inflationary adjustment provisions based on accepted industry indices, and we typically include an inflation component in estimating our supply costs. In addition, Spirit has long-term supply agreements for raw materials with most of its suppliers and for certain raw materials, Spirit is party to collective raw material sourcing contracts arranged through Boeing and Airbus (see\n2026 Notes. In June 2016, the Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.850% Senior Notes due June 15, 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d) with interest payable, in cash in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the 2026 Notes was $297.2 million.\nSenior Notes\nThe A&R Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on indebtedness liens, types of business, acquisitions, sales or transfers of assets, payments of dividends, transactions with affiliates, change in control, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the contract method of accounting and records sales and profits on each contract in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, as further described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. In determining our profits and losses in accordance with this method, we are required to make significant assumptions regarding our future costs and revenues, as well as the estimated number of units to be manufactured under the contract and other variables. We continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and our most recent experience. If we make material changes to our assumptions, such as a reduction in the estimated number of units to be produced under the contract (which could be caused by emerging market trends or other factors), an increase in future production costs, or a change in the recoverability of increased design or production costs, we may experience negative cumulative catch-up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized. In some cases, we may recognize forward loss amounts. For a broader description of the various types of risks we face related to new and maturing programs, see Risk Factors.\u201d For discussion of the impacts of the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606 on revenues and profit recognition, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under the sub-heading New Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\n\n (2) See Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\u201d for detailed discussion of operating data. \nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statement and notes thereto.\nFuselage Systems. Fuselage Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $3,730.8 million, an increase of $232.0 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the B737 and A350 XWB programs, increased revenue on certain non-recurring Boeing programs, and increased defense related work, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B777 program and decreased GCS&S activity. Fuselage Systems segment operating margins were 9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 13% for the same period in the prior year, with the decrease primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the B787 fuselage program. In 2017, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $4.0 million, as well as ($223.2) million of net forward loss charges. In comparison, during 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $13.6 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements, as well as ($133.4) million of net forward losses.\nOperating Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we had a net cash inflow of $572.7 million from operating activities, a decrease of $143.2 million, compared to a net cash inflow of $716.9 million for the prior year. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the repayment under B787 Amendment #25 of $236.0 million less certain adjustments to Boeing as a retroactive adjustments for payments that were based on interim pricing, partially offset by lower net tax payments in 2017. Net tax payments made during 2017 were $101.9 million, resulting in an increase in net cash of $89.5 million, compared to net tax payments of $191.4 million during the prior year.\nThe TCJA introduces a tax on global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d) for years ending after December 31, 2017. Our analysis and accounting for the effects of the GILTI provision is incomplete and an accounting policy on whether we will account for GILTI as a period expense or record deferred taxes for anticipated GILTI has not been made.\nWing Systems. Wing Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $1,508.7 million, an increase of $71.0 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the A350 XWB and one-time claim settlements with customers, partially offset by lower B777 wing related activity and fewer production deliveries on the B747. Wing Systems segment operating margins were 15% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to 12% for the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by favorable labor and material cost performance. In 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $23.4 million driven by claim settlements with customers and productivity and efficiency improvements, as well as favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $5.1 million. In comparison, during 2015, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $2.7 million, partially offset by net forward loss charges of ($0.3) million.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\nAdditionally, we may receive proceeds from asset sales and may seek to access the credit markets, if needed. In October 2017, the Company entered into an agreement (the Receivable Sales Agreement\u201d) to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to a third party financial institution. Transfers under this agreement are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from the Company's balance sheet. For additional information on the sale of receivables, please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounts Receivable, net.\nInvesting Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we had a net cash outflow of $272.8 million from investing activities, an increase in outflow of $19.4 million, compared to a net cash outflow of $253.4 million for the prior year. The increase in cash outflow was driven by higher investment in capital during 2017 to support increasing production rates.\nA majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long-term contracts that set fixed unit prices. Some but not all of our contracts provide for price adjustment for inflation. The Sustaining Agreement and B787 Agreement, which together generate the significant majority of the Company's revenue, provide for price adjustments in the case of abnormal escalation\u201d based upon a formula referencing specified government price indicies. In addition, we typically consider expected inflation in determining proposed\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1,260.1 million, or 18% of total net revenues for the same period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1,142.8 million, or 17% of total net revenues for the same period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $934.9 million, or 14% of total net revenues for the same period.\nAt December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the TCJA; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and continue to account for those items based on our existing accounting under ASC 740 and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment of the TCJA. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount of $28.7 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.\nto measure production or shipset deliveries, which may result in slight variations in production or delivery quantities of the various shipset components in any given period.\nAs we continue to position the Company for future success, our focus in 2018 will revolve around our operational execution with a focus on safety and quality while working to meet our customers' requirements for production rate changes. Additionally, we will focus on positioning ourselves for organic and inorganic growth within the commercial, defense, and fabrication markets. Considering the strong demand for commercial aircraft and the expected continued need for defense aircraft for the foreseeable future, both markets offer possibilities for growth. To help support our work on production rate increases and market growth, we will continue to focus on attracting, developing, and retaining a world-class team at our sites and remaining a trusted partner to our customers and suppliers.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance of the Term Loan was $462.5 million and the carrying value was $460.7 million.\nOn June 6, 2016, we entered into the senior unsecured Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among Spirit, as borrower, the Company, as parent guarantor, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents named therein (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement provides for a $650.0 revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d) and a $500.0 term loan A facility (the Term Loan\u201d). Each of the Revolver and the Term Loan has a maturity date of June 4, 2021, and each bears interest, at Spirit's option, at either LIBOR plus 1.5% or a defined base rate\u201d plus 0.50%, subject to adjustment to amounts between and including LIBOR plus 1.125% and LIBOR plus 2.0% (or amounts between and including base rate plus 0.125% and base rate plus 1.0%, as applicable) based on changes to Spirit's senior unsecured debt rating provided by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC and/or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. The principal obligations under the Term Loan are to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of $6.25 million, with the remaining balance due at maturity of the Term Loan. The A&R Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that provides Spirit with the option to increase the Revolver commitments and/or institute one or more additional term loans by an amount not to exceed $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the participation of the lenders. Spirit used the proceeds of the Term Loan, along with cash on hand, to pay off the outstanding amounts of the term loan under our prior credit agreement and to pay a portion of the fees and expenses payable in connection with the A&R Credit Agreement.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law legislation referred to as the TCJA. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), including amendments which significantly change the taxation of business entities.\nResults of Operations\nFinancing Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we had a net cash outflow of $580.9 million for financing activities, a decrease in outflow of $137.8 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $718.7 million for the same period in the prior year. During 2017, the Company repurchased 7.5 million shares of its class A common stock for $496.3 million, compared to the repurchase of 14.2 million shares of class A common stock for $649.6 million in 2016. During 2017, the Company paid cash dividends totaling $47.1 million to its stockholders of record. Additionally, during 2016, we entered into the A&R Credit Agreement and issued $300.0 million of 2026 Notes and used those proceeds along with cash on hand to repurchase $300.0 million of our senior notes due in 2020 pursuant to a tender offer and redemption.\nOperating Income. Operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $569.1 million, which was $156.0 million lower than operating income of $725.1 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily the result of the B787 net forward loss charges recognized during the second quarter of 2017.\nWe engage in business in various non-U.S. markets. As of December 31, 2017, we have facilities in the U.K., France, and Malaysia, a worldwide supplier base, and a repair center for the European and Middle-Eastern regions. We purchase certain components, assemblies, and materials that we use in our products from foreign suppliers and a portion of our products will be sold directly to foreign customers, including Airbus, or resold to foreign end-users (e.g., foreign airlines and militaries). In addition, we operate an assembly facility in Saint-Nazaire, France to receive and assemble center fuselage frame sections for the A350 XWB commercial aircraft from the facility in Kinston, North Carolina before they are shipped to Airbus.\nSegments. The following table shows segment revenues and operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nPropulsion Systems. Propulsion Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $1,777.3 million, an increase of $26.6 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue recognized on certain nonrecurring Boeing programs and increased production deliveries on the B767, partially offset by fewer production deliveries on the B747 and B777 and lower net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement. Propulsion Systems segment operating margins were 18% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to 22% for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower production deliveries on the B747, the favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments recorded during 2015, increased revenue from lower-margin programs and the absence of nonrecurring customer incentive payments recorded during 2015. In 2016, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of ($0.4) million and favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $10.1 million. In comparison, during 2015, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $22.8 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements on mature programs, as well as $2.4 million of favorable changes in estimates on loss programs.\nWing Systems. Wing Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,578.8 million, an increase of $70.1 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the B737, B787, A320, and A350 XWB programs and higher net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the B777, B747, and A380 programs and the absence of a one-time claim settlement with a customer. Wing Systems segment operating margins were 13% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 15% for the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the B787 program. In 2017, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $23.4 million and net forward loss charges of ($63.9) million. In comparison, during 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $23.4 million driven by claim settlements with customers and productivity and efficiency improvements, as well as favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $5.1 million.\nThe Company has recorded several forward losses on the A350 XWB fuselage recurring program. In earlier stages of production, forward losses were driven by production inefficiencies, engineering changes to the aircraft design, and higher test and transportation costs. In 2016, the Company experienced various disruption and production inefficiencies that exceeded previous estimates, which resulted in forward loss charges. During 2017, the Company recorded an additional forward loss on the A350XWB program of $19.4 million primarily related to unfavorable exchange rate impacts on labor and non-labor costs and supplier claims.\n (3) Interest on our Term Loan was calculated for all years using the three-month LIBOR yield curve as of December 31, 2017 plus applicable margin. \nOur primary future cash needs will consist of working capital, debt service, research and development, capital expenditures, potential share repurchases, dividend payments, and merger and acquisition or disposition activities. We expend significant capital as we undertake new programs, which begin in the non-recurring investment phase of our business model. In addition, we expend significant capital to meet increased production rates on certain mature and maturing programs, including the B737, B787, A320, and A350 XWB programs. In response to announced customer production rate increases, we are evaluating various plans to relieve capacity constraints. We also require capital to develop new technologies for the next generation of aircraft, which may not be funded by our customers. Capital expenditures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $273.1 million, as compared to $254.0 million for the same period in 2016, as we made a higher investment in capital in 2017 to support increasing production rates. We plan to fund future capital expenditures and cash requirements from cash on hand, cash generated by operations, customer cash advances, borrowings available under our A&R Credit Agreement, and proceeds from asset sales, if any.\nOther\nAs we continue on our second contract block on the B787 program, our performance for this program depends on our continued ability to achieve cost reductions in our manufacturing and support labor and supply chain. We have had several changes in estimates on the B787 program. Most recently, in 2017, Boeing and Spirit executed the 787 Amendment, which established pricing terms for the B787-8, -9, and -10 derivative models between line unit 501 and line unit 1405 and required the parties to negotiate pricing for B787 line units 1406 and beyond beginning 24 months prior to the scheduled delivery date for line unit 1405.\ncatch-up adjustments of $3.8 million and net forward loss charges of ($40.2) million. In comparison, during 2016, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of ($0.4) million and favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $10.1 million.\nOther than operating leases disclosed in the notes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017.\nAmendment No. 5 to our prior credit agreement which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt charge of $3.6 million. Additionally, interest expense for 2016 reflects lower average interest rates on our term loan and bonds compared to the prior year.\nChanges in Estimates\nOn November 1, 2016, the Company announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $600.0 million of our class A common stock. On July 25, 2017, the Company increased the existing share repurchase program by up to an additional $400.0 million of our class A common stock, resulting in a total program authorization of $1.0 billion. On January 24, 2018, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the program of approximately $500 million. As a result, the total amount remaining in the authorization is approximately $1.0 billion.\n (4) Provisional amount for our one-time transition tax liability for all of our operating foreign subsidiaries, which we will elect to pay over a period of eight years as provided for in the TCJA. The state income tax effect of the transition tax will be offset by state income tax credit carryforwards. \nSG&A and Research and Development. SG&A expense was $7.5 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to expenses related to executive retirements and severance including stock compensation. Research and development expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $4.0 million lower, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to fewer internal projects underway.\n (1) Inclusive of forward losses, changes in estimates on loss programs, and cumulative catch-up adjustments. These changes in estimates for the periods ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 are further detailed in the segment discussions below and in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Changes in Estimates. \nForeign Operations\nIncome taxes are accounted for in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Tax rate changes impacting these assets and liabilities are recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs.\n\nSpirit is party to a joint venture with Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company Limited ( HAECO\u201d), and its subsidiary, Taikoo Aircraft Engineering Company Limited ( TAECO\u201d), Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, and Cal-Asia to develop and implement a state-of-the-art composite and metal bond component repair station in the Asia-Pacific region. The service center is called Taikoo Spirit AeroSystems Composite Co. Ltd.\nPrograms\nA350 XWB\nOperating Activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had a net cash inflow of $716.9 million from operating activities, a decrease of $572.8 million, compared to a net cash inflow of $1,289.7 million for the prior year. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower cash receipts in 2016 and income tax payments during 2016 as compared to income tax refunds in 2015. In 2016, deferred revenue and advance payments from customers were lower by $290.3 million compared to 2015. Net tax payments made during 2016 were $191.4 million, a decrease in net cash provided of $261.1 million, compared to net tax refunds of $69.7 million received during the prior year.\n (1) See Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\u201d for detailed discussion of operating data. \nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized total changes in estimates of $52.4 million, which includes favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments related to periods prior to 2015 of $41.6 million and favorable changes in estimates on loss programs of $10.8 million, which is net of forward loss charges of ($6.9) million. Favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments for the periods prior to 2015 and changes in estimates on loss programs were primarily driven by productivity and efficiency improvements, favorable cost performance, mitigation of risk, benefits from increased production rates related to the absorption of fixed costs, and favorable pricing negotiations on a maturing program. Forward loss charges were due to a production rate decrease on a mature program.\nTax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities: We re-measured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the TCJA and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. Included within our net deferred tax assets and liabilities are state income tax credits, which are recorded net of federal tax expense. With a lower federal income tax rate of 21%, the net value of these credits has increased. The provisional amount recorded related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset balance was a tax benefit recorded as a component of income tax from continuing operations of $16.2 million.\nThe Company continues to pay quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.10 per share. The most recent dividend was declared by the Board on January 24, 2018, to be paid on April 9, 2018, to stockholders of record as of March 19, 2018.\nAdvances on the B787 Program. Boeing has made advance payments to Spirit under the B787 Agreement, which are required to be repaid to Boeing by way of offsets against the purchase price for future shipset deliveries. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of advance payments received by us from Boeing under the B787 Agreement and not yet repaid was approximately $331.8 million.\n_______________________________________\nWe continue to maintain that earnings of all foreign operating subsidiaries are indefinitely invested outside the U.S. on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings to fund working capital requirements, service existing obligations, and invest in efforts to secure future business. As a result, no additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities. We have completed analysis regarding potential withholding tax related to potential future dividends and anticipate that any associated withholding taxes would be immaterial based upon current law. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities (i.e., basis difference in excess of that subject to the one-time transition tax) is not practicable at this time.\nFor additional information on our outstanding debt, please see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt.\n_______________________________________\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\nSenior Unsecured Credit Facility\n\nOperating Income. Operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $725.1 million, which was $137.9 million lower than operating income of $863.0 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily the result of net forward loss charges recognized during the second quarter of 2016.\nSG&A and Research and Development. SG&A expense was $28.0 million lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to expenses related to executive retirements and severance including stock compensation recognized in 2016. Research and development expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $7.4 million higher as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to more internal projects underway.\nManagement's Focus\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain of our operating data:\nAll Other. All Other segment net revenues consist of sundry sales of miscellaneous services, tooling contracts and natural gas revenues from KIESC. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, All Other segment net revenues were $8.1 million, a decrease of $0.4 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The All Other segment recorded 20% operating margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\npricing when we bid on new work. Although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through these protections, sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRevenues and Profit Recognition under Long-Term Contracts\n (5) Purchase obligations represent computing, tooling, and property, plant and equipment commitments as of December 31, 2017.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSome of the more significant changes that impact our Company included in the TCJA are reductions in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the ability to immediately expense certain property for specific tax years, the requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings as the U.S. transitions to a territorial tax system.\nFuselage Systems. Fuselage Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $3,498.8 million, an increase of $51.8 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher production deliveries on the A350 XWB and B767 and the absence of charges related to historical non-conformance claims, partially offset by lower net revenues recognized on the B787 program in accordance with pricing terms under the B787 Agreement and lower production deliveries on the B747 and B777. Fuselage Systems segment operating margins were 13% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to 18% for the same period in the prior year, with the decrease primarily driven by the net forward loss charges recorded on the A350 XWB fuselage program. In 2016, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $13.6 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements on mature programs, as well as ($133.4) million of net forward losses. In comparison, during 2015, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $16.1 million driven by productivity and efficiency improvements on mature programs, as well as $8.7 million of favorable changes in estimates on loss programs.\nCash Flows", "item_7_tables": "Table 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
