Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis report, and in particular this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Please see the cautionary language at the very beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the identification of and risks relating to forward-looking statements, as well as Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" as set out in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an independent international energy company incorporated in the United States and engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration, development and production. Our principal business activity is in Colombia and we also have business activities in Peru and Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 97% (year ended December 31, 2014 - 95%; year ended December 31, 2013 - 96%) of our revenue and other income was generated in Colombia. We are headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nDuring early 2015, largely as a result of the low commodity price environment and drilling results in Peru, we ceased all development expenditures in the Breta\u00f1a Field on Block 95 in Peru other than what was necessary to maintain tangible asset integrity and security. As a result, all probable and possible reserves associated with the field were reclassified as contingent resources.\nOn May 7, 2015, we entered into an agreement (the Agreement\u201d) with West Face SPV (Cayman) I L.P. ( West Face\u201d) pursuant to which we settled a proxy contest. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Gary Guidry was appointed as our\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Guidry replaced Duncan Nightingale in that role, who was serving as interim Chief Executive Officer since February 2015 and, with the appointment of Mr. Guidry as Chief Executive Officer, was designated as Executive Vice President until February 19, 2016, when he ceased performing this role. Additionally, effective May 11, 2015, Ryan Ellson was appointed as Chief Financial Officer. In connection with our entry into the Agreement, the size of our Board of Directors was expanded, new directors were appointed to fill the newly created vacancies and certain existing directors agreed not to stand for re-election at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders. In June 2015, our Board of Directors approved a new capital program focusing on development activities in Colombia.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had estimated proved reserves NAR of 38.9 MMBOE, approximately 98% oil, of which 80% were proved developed reserves. Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from our operations and cash on hand.\nOn January 13, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Petroamerica Oil Corp (\"Petroamerica\") for cash consideration of $70.6 million and the issuance of 13,656,719 shares of Gran Tierra common stock with a value of $25.8 million. On January 25, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of PetroGranada Colombia Limited (\"PGC\") for a net purchase price of $19.0 million, after giving consideration to estimated net working capital of $18.7 million. In addition, we agreed to pay contingent consideration of $4.0 million if cumulative production from the Putumayo-7 Block plus gross proved plus probable reserves under the Putumayo-7 Block meet or exceed 8 MMbbl. Combined proved NAR oil and gas reserves of Petroamerica and PGC as at December 31, 2015, were 3.9 MMBOE.\nOil prices are volatile and unpredictable and influenced by concerns over world supply and demand imbalance and many other market factors outside of our control. Oil prices started falling in July 2014 and fell dramatically during the period December 2014 to March 2015. Prices have remained low and volatile. During 2015, the average price realized for our oil was $41.56 per bbl (2014 - $83.22; 2013 - $92.31). Average Brent oil price for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $52.35 per bbl compared with $99.02 per bbl in 2014 and $108.64 in 2013. Average West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") oil price for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $48.78 per bbl compared with $93.00 per bbl in 2014 and $97.97 in 2013.\nHighlights\nTable 57:

previously discussed, all probable and possible reserves associated with the Breta\u00f1a Field on Block 95 in Peru were reclassified as contingent resources in a report with an effective date of January 31, 2015. These reserves are excluded from the table above. Estimated proved, probable and possible oil and gas reserves, NAR, as at December 31, 2013, included 4.4, 2.1 and 10.3 MMBOE, respectively, in Argentina.\nWith the exception of reserves and net income, the 2014 and 2013 amounts in the table above exclude amounts relating to discontinued operations. Oil and gas production NAR associated with discontinued operations was nil BOEPD for the year ended December 31, 2015 (2014 - 1,361 BOEPD; 2013 - 3,028 BOEPD). Argentina production for the December 31, 2014, was calculated to the date of sale of June 25, 2014.\n(1) Sales volumes represent production NAR adjusted for inventory changes and losses.\nNon-GAAP measures\nOperating netback, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and funds flow from continuing operations are non-GAAP measures which do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP. Investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to net income or loss or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\n(2) Operating netback as presented is oil and gas sales net of royalties and operating and transportation expenses. Management believes that netback is a useful supplemental measure for management and investors to analyze operating performance and provide an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of other income and expenses.\n(3) EBITDA, as presented, is net income or loss adjusted for loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, depletion, depreciation and accretion ( DD&A\u201d) expenses, asset impairment and income tax recovery or expense. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for foreign exchange gains. Management uses these financial measures to analyze performance and income or loss generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of how non-cash items affect that income or loss, and believes that these financial measures are also useful supplemental information for investors to analyze performance and our financial results.

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our new management changed our method of calculating funds flow from continuing operations to be more consistent with our peers. Funds flow from continuing operations is no longer net of cash settlement of asset retirement obligation. Additionally, foreign exchange losses on cash and cash equivalents have been excluded from funds flow. Comparative information has been reclassified to be calculated on a consistent basis. Management uses this financial measure to analyze performance and income or loss generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of how non-cash items affect that income or loss, and believes that this financial measure is also useful supplemental information for investors to analyze performance and our financial results.

Oil prices are volatile and unpredictable and are influenced by concerns about the quantity of world supply and demand, market competition between large suppliers to the market for market share, political influences, financial markets and the impact of the worldwide economy on oil supply and demand growth.\nWe believe that our current operations and 2016 capital expenditure program can be funded from cash flow from existing operations and cash on hand. Should our operating cash flow decline due to unforeseen events, including additional pipeline delivery restrictions in Colombia or continued downturn in oil and gas prices, we would consider financing our capital expenditure program with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or capital markets transactions, or a combination thereof, or we would consider reducing our capital expenditure program. Given the current economic environment and unstable conditions in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe and the current over supply of oil in world markets, the oil price environment is unpredictable and unstable. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, these events may have on oil prices and demand. The timing and execution of our capital expenditure program are also affected by the availability of services from third party oil field contractors and our ability to obtain, sustain or renew necessary government licenses and permits on a timely basis to conduct exploration and development activities. Any delay may affect our ability to execute our capital expenditure program.\nThe credit markets, including the high yield bond market and other debt markets that provide capital to oil and gas companies have experienced adverse conditions. We have not been materially impacted by these conditions; however, continuing volatility in oil prices may continue to contribute to these adverse conditions, which could increase costs associated with renewing or issuing debt or affect our ability to access those markets.\nOur future growth and acquisitions may depend on our ability to raise additional funds through equity and debt markets. Should we be required to raise debt or equity financing to fund capital expenditures or other acquisition and development opportunities, such funding may be affected by the market value of shares of our Common Stock. The current low and volatile oil price has had a negative impact on the value of shares of our Common Stock. Also, raising funds by issuing shares or other equity securities would further dilute our existing shareholders, and this dilution would be exacerbated by a decline in our share price. Any securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to our existing equity securities. Borrowing money may also involve further pledging of some or all of our assets, may require compliance with debt covenants and will expose us to interest rate risk. Depending on the currency used to borrow money, we may also be exposed to further foreign exchange risk. Our ability to borrow money and the interest rate we pay for any money we borrow will be affected by market conditions and we cannot predict what price we may pay for any borrowed money.\nFor over 40 years, the Colombian government has been engaged in a conflict with two main Marxist guerrilla groups: the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\"FARC\") and the National Liberation Army (\"ELN\"). Both of these groups have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States and the European Union. Another threat comes from criminal gangs formed from the former members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia militia, a paramilitary group that originally sprouted up to combat FARC and ELN, which the Colombian government successfully dissolved. We operate principally in the Putumayo Basin in Colombia. Pipelines have been primary targets because such pipelines cannot be adequately secured due to the sheer length of such pipelines and the remoteness of the areas in which the pipelines are laid. The CENIT S.A-operated Trans-Andean oil pipeline (the \"OTA pipeline\u201d) which transports oil from the Putumayo region and which is one of our export routes, has been targeted by these guerrilla groups. In 2015, the OTA pipeline was shutdown for approximately 213 days, which included 117 days as a result of a landslide.\nWhile peace talks continue between the Colombian government and the FARC, peace process negotiations between the government and FARC may not generate the intended outcome for both parties, though the Colombian government has stated that a resolution is expected to be reached during the first quarter of 2016. The impact of such a peace process is not determinable on our operations. Continuing attempts by the Colombian government to reduce or prevent guerrilla activity may not be successful and guerrilla activity may continue to disrupt our operations in the future. Our efforts to increase security measures may not be successful and there can also be no assurance that we can maintain the safety of our or our contractors' field personnel and Bogota head office personnel or operations in Colombia or that this violence will not continue to adversely affect our operations in the future and cause significant loss.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTable 61:

Production during the year ended December 31, 2015, reflected approximately 213 days of OTA pipeline disruptions in Colombia compared with 180 days in 2014. Despite the OTA pipeline being down for 213 days we did not have to shut in any production in 2015 due to the different routes available to transport our crude oil.\nIn Brazil, our operations in the Ti\u00ea Field were suspended by the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Petr\u00f3leo G\u00e1s Natural e Biocombust\u00edveis (\"ANP\") from March 11, 2015, to May 15, 2015, due to alleged non-compliance with certain requirements regarding the health and safety management system identified during a safety and operational audit conducted by the ANP in early 2015. Clearance to resume production was received on May 15, 2015. However, during the second half of 2015, our production in Brazil was limited by a temporary capacity reduction at a third party's shipping facility due to an integrity issue with one of their oil receiving tanks. The operator of the facility has advised that it expects to have this tank repaired and operational by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nOil and gas production NAR for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased by 1% to 19,283 BOEPD compared with 19,071 BOEPD in 2013. In 2014 in Colombia, production from new wells in the Moqueta Field in the Chaza Block and a new well in the Llanos-22 Block were partially offset by the impact of well downtime for workovers and a water cut increase in the Costayaco Field in the Chaza Block. Production during the year ended December 31, 2014, reflected approximately 180 days of OTA pipeline disruptions in Colombia compared with 229 days in 2013.\nOil and gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015, decreased by 1% to 18,260 BOEPD compared with 18,523 BOEPD in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, an oil inventory increase accounted for 0.4 MMbbl, or 1,229 bopd, of reduced sales compared with an oil inventory increase in 2014 which accounted for 0.3 MMbbl, or 760 bopd, reduced sales. Oil inventory changes are primarily in Colombia.\nOil and gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased by 4% to 18,523 BOEPD compared with 19,239 BOEPD in 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, an oil inventory increase in 2014 accounted for 0.3 MMbbl, or 760 bopd, of reduced sales compared with an oil inventory decrease in 2013 which accounted for

Refer to non-GAAP measures disclosure above regarding this measure.\nOil and gas sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, decreased to $276.0 million from $559.4 million in 2014 primarily as a result of the effect of decreased realized prices. Average realized prices decreased by 50% to $41.41 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $82.74 per BOE for 2014 primarily due to lower benchmark oil prices. Average Brent oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $52.35 per bbl compared with $99.02 per bbl in 2014. WTI oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $48.78 per bbl compared with $93.00 per bbl in 2014.\nDuring periods of OTA pipeline disruptions we have multiple transportation alternatives. Each transportation route has varying effects on realized prices and transportation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 62% of our oil and gas volumes sold in Colombia were through alternative transportation routes alternatives compared with 52% in 2014.\nOil and gas sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased to $559.4 million from $647.0 million in 2013 as a result of the combined effect of decreased sales and realized prices. Average realized prices decreased by 10% to $82.74 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2014, from $92.13 per BOE for 2013. Average Brent oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $99.02 per bbl compared with $108.64 per bbl in 2013. WTI oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $93.00 per bbl compared with $97.97 per bbl in 2013. Additionally, beginning July 1, 2014, the port operations fee component of the OTA pipeline pricing structure increased by $2.94 per bbl resulting in a reduction of realized oil prices by this amount on sales delivered through the OTA pipeline. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 52% of our oil and gas volumes sold in Colombia were through alternative transportation routes alternatives compared with 64% in 2013.\nTransportation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $40.2 million, or $6.03 per BOE, compared with $24.2 million, or $3.58 per BOE, in 2014. On a per BOE basis, transportation expenses increased by 68%. The increase in transportation expenses per BOE was primarily due to the alternative transportation routes used during periods of OTA pipeline disruptions. During 2015, we used new alternative transportation routes which carried higher transportation costs, but higher realized prices compared with other customers.\nTransportation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $24.2 million, or $3.58 per BOE, compared with $18.9 million, or $2.70 per BOE, in 2013. On a per BOE basis, transportation expenses increased by 33%. The increase in transportation expenses per BOE was primarily due to higher transportation costs associated with higher sales using the OTA pipeline which carried higher transportation costs instead of the realized price reductions that we incurred with some alternative customers in 2013.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $75.6 million, or $11.34 per BOE, compared with $89.8 million, or $13.28 per BOE in 2014. On a per BOE basis, operating expenses decreased by 15%. The decrease in operating expenses per BOE in 2015 was primarily due to Colombian operating cost savings and the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies in South America. In Brazil, in the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $1.7 million, or $8.98 per bbl based on volumes sold in Brazil, of one-time penalties relating to alleged non-compliance with certain requirements regarding the health and safety management system, identified during a safety and operational audit conducted by the ANP in early 2015.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $89.8 million, or $13.28 per BOE, compared with $91.2 million, or $12.99 per BOE, in 2013. Operating expenses per BOE increased in 2014 primarily due to increased workover expenses.\nDD&A Expenses\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, thousands of U.S. Dollars\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, U.S. Dollars Per BOE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, thousands of U.S. Dollars\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, U.S. Dollars Per BOE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colombia\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil\n</td> <td>6,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Peru\n</td> <td>789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>1,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, thousands of U.S. Dollars\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, U.S. Dollars Per BOE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colombia\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil\n</td> <td>14,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Peru\n</td> <td>362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>1,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDD&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, decreased to $176.4 million from $185.9 million in 2014. On a per BOE basis, the depletion rate decreased by 4% to $26.47 from $27.49. On a per BOE basis, the decrease was due to lower costs in the depletable base and increased proved reserves at year end.\nDD&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased to $185.9 million from $200.9 million in 2013. On a per BOE basis, the depletion rate decreased by 4% to $27.49 from $28.60. Increased proved reserves, were only partially offset by increased costs in the depletable base.\nAsset Impairment\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. Under this method, the net book value of properties on a country-by-country basis, less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling\u201d. The ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties, discounted at 10% per year. In calculating discounted future net revenues, oil and natural gas prices are determined using the average price during the 12 months period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the balance sheet, calculated as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month within such period for that oil and natural gas. That average price is then held constant, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts. Therefore, ceiling test estimates are based on historical prices discounted at 10% per year and it should not be assumed that estimates of future net revenues represent the fair market value of our reserves. We used an average Brent price of $54.08 per bbl for the purposes of the December 31, 2015, ceiling test calculations.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands of U.S. Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of oil and gas properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colombia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Peru\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, ceiling test impairment losses in our Colombia and Brazil cost centers and inventory impairment losses were primarily due to lower oil prices. The ceiling test impairment loss in our Brazil cost center was recognized during the first three quarters of 2015. As a result of a technical evaluation of the Brazil cost center reserves completed during the fourth quarter of 2015, an upward technical revision in proved reserves resulted in no ceiling test impairment loss during that quarter. Impairment losses in our Peru cost center related to costs incurred on Block 95.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2014, impairment losses in our Peru cost center related to costs incurred on Block 95, and in the year ended December 31, 2013, ceiling test impairment losses in our Brazil cost center related to lower realized prices and an increase in operating costs.\nG&A Expenses\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands of U.S. Dollars)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>G&A Expenses Before Stock-Based Compensation, Gross\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-Based Compensation\n</td> <td>2,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized G&A and Overhead Recoveries\n</td> <td>(36,471\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(53,359\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(47,857\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Dollars Per BOE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>G&A Expenses Before Stock-Based Compensation, Gross\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-Based Compensation\n</td> <td>0.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized G&A and Overhead Recoveries\n</td> <td>(5.47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7.90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6.82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, of $32.4 million decreased by 37% from $51.2 million in 2014. These decreases were mainly due to reductions in the number of our employees as part of our cost saving measures, a focus on reductions of our other G&A expenses and the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies in South America and Canada, which resulted in savings for costs denominated in local currency. Additionally, G&A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015, were net of a credit of $2.6 million relating to the reversal of stock-based compensation expense for unvested options and RSUs associated with terminated employees. These G&A expense reductions were partially offset by lower allocations to capital projects due to lower capital activity and deferred financing fees expensed as a result of the cancellation of our previous credit facility. G&A expenses per BOE in the year ended December 31, 2015, of $4.85 were 36% lower compared with $7.58 in 2014 for the same reasons, partially offset by lower sales.\nG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, of $51.2 million increased by 25% from $41.1 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher salary and consulting expenses associated with increased activity for expanded operations in Peru in 2014.\nSeverance Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, severance expenses were $9.0 million compared with nil in 2014 and 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced the number of our employees and contractors.\nEquity Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, equity tax expense of $3.8 million represented a Colombian tax which was calculated based on our Colombian legal entities' balance sheet equity for tax purposes at January 1, 2015. The legal obligation for each year's equity tax liability arises on January 1 of each year, therefore, we recognized the 2015 annual equity tax amount in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2015.\nForeign Exchange Gains\nFor the years ended December, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had foreign exchange gains of $17.2 million, $39.5 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred taxes are considered a monetary liability and require translation from local\ncurrency to U.S. dollar functional currency at each balance sheet date. This translation was the main source of the foreign exchange gains.

(\"Madalena\") shares we received in connection with the sale of our Argentina business unit in June 2014.\nForeign currency derivative gains and losses related to our Colombian peso non-deliverable forward contracts. We purchased these contracts for purposes of fixing the exchange rate at which we would purchase or sell Colombian pesos to settle our income tax installments and payments. At December 30, 2015, we did not have any open foreign currency derivative positions.\nOther Gains and Losses\nOther gains and losses in the three years ended December 31, 2015, related to a contingent loss accrued in connection with a legal dispute. In 2013, we received an adverse legal judgment and the amount awarded in the legal judgment was denominated in bbl of oil. We filed an appeal against the judgment. Other gains in the year ended December 31, 2014, related to a reduction in the value of this contingent loss due to lower oil prices. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we received an adverse legal judgment from the appeal court. We paid $1.9 million, the amount awarded by the appeal court, during the fourth quarter of 2015 and a gain was recognized as a result of a reduction in the in the value of the previously recognized contingent loss.\nIncome Tax Expense and Recovery\nIncome tax recovery was $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 ($15.4 million current income tax expense and $115.4 million deferred income tax recovery), compared with income tax expense of $127.2 million in 2014 ($92.9 million current income tax expense and $34.4 million deferred income tax expense). Current income tax expense was lower in 2015 as a result of lower taxable income in Colombia. The deferred tax recovery for the year ended December 31, 2015, included $91.7 million associated with the ceiling test impairment loss in Colombia. In 2014, deferred income tax recovery associated with impairment losses in Peru was offset by a full valuation allowance\nOur effective tax rate was 27% for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we had income tax expense despite having losses from continuing operations. In 2014, our loss before income taxes was primarily due to impairment losses in Peru which were fully offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014 was primarily due to a smaller increase in the valuation allowance as a result of lower impairment losses in Peru where there is a full valuation allowance and an increase in foreign currency translation adjustments. Additionally, our income tax expense in 2014 reflected the impact of future income tax rate changes in Colombia on our deferred tax liability. In 2014, tax legislation was enacted in Colombia which increased the 2015 to 2018 tax rates resulting in an increase of the Colombian deferred tax liability of approximately $31.0 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the difference between the effective tax rate of 27% and the 35% U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance, non-deductible third party royalty in Colombia and other local taxes, partially offset by the impact of foreign taxes, foreign currency translation adjustments and other permanent differences.\nIncome tax expense was $127.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $128.3 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower taxable income in Colombia and lower taxes in Brazil, partially offset by the impact of future tax rate changes on the Colombian deferred tax liability, as discussed above. In 2013 in Brazil, a net payment of $54.0 million from a third party in connection with the termination of a farm-in agreement resulted in a current tax expense of approximately $10.4 million.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2014, we had income tax expense despite having loss from continuing operations, compared with an effective tax rate of 41% in 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the difference between the effective tax rate and the 35% U.S. statutory rate was primarily a result of a loss before income taxes caused by the 2014 impairment loss in Peru which was fully offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. Other factors that affected the effective tax rate in 2014 were the change in the Colombian future tax rate, a non-deductible third party royalty in Colombia, the impact of other local taxes, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments and other permanent differences.\nThe variance from the 35% U.S. statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance, a non-deductible third party royalty in Colombia, the impact of local taxes, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by other permanent differences, foreign currency translation adjustments and the foreign tax rate differential.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nOn June 25, 2014, we sold our Argentina business unit to Madalena for aggregate consideration of $69.3 million, comprising $55.4 million in cash and $13.9 million in Madalena shares. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we met the criteria to classify our Argentina business unit as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2014. As such, the results of operations for our Argentina business unit are reflected as loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes and discussed further in Note 3, \"Discontinued Operations,\" of our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2015.\nFunds Flow From Continuing Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, funds flow from continuing operations decreased by 66% from $319.6 million to $108.3 million primarily due to decreased oil and natural gas sales, higher transportation, severance and equity tax expenses and cash outflow on settlement of foreign currency derivatives, partially offset by decreased operating, G&A and income tax expenses and higher realized foreign exchange gains.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, funds flow from continuing operations decreased by 8% from $348.0 million to $319.6 million primarily due to decreased oil and natural gas sales, increased transportation and G&A expenses and lower realized foreign exchange gains, partially offset by decreased operating and income tax expenses and cash inflows on settlement of foreign currency derivatives.\n2016 Capital Program\nIn January 2016, we announced our 2016 capital budget. Our base 2016 capital program of $107 million consists of: $76 million for Colombia; $8 million for Brazil; $6 million for Peru; and $17 million for other.\nIn Colombia, our base 2016 capital program includes two water injector wells in the Costayaco Field and three development wells in the Moqueta Field, both on the Chaza Block (100% WI, operated), two exploration wells and a development well in the Putumayo-7 Block (subject to regulatory approval, 100% WI, operated) and an exploration well on the Llanos-10 Block (50% WI, non-operated) with the costs being carried by a third party. Facilities work is also planned for the Chaza Block.\nIn Peru, the 2016 capital program includes only those activities required for retention of lands and security of assets. In Brazil, the capital program includes minimal activity to implement water injection for reservoir pressure maintenance, and to preserve current production levels. In both Peru and Brazil, operations have been scaled back significantly, with the aim of allowing time to explore and execute on options to maximize shareholder value.\nIn addition to our 2016 base capital budget, we have a discretionary capital budget of $61 million that we may utilize during 2016 in the event of an increase in commodity prices. If deployed, we expect that our discretionary capital budget would target six exploration wells, five development wells and seismic activities in Colombia.\nWe expect to finance our 2016 capital program through cash flows from operations and cash on hand, while retaining financial flexibility to undertake further development opportunities and opportunistically pursue acquisitions.\nCapital Program - Colombia\nCapital expenditures in our Colombian segment during the year ended December 31, 2015, were $87.7 million, including drilling of $60.5 million, facilities of $13.6 million, seismic expenditures of $6.2 million and $7.4 million of other expenditures.\nThe significant elements of our 2015 capital program in Colombia were:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On the Chaza Block (100% working interest (\"WI\"), operated), we drilled and completed the Costayaco-25D and Costayaco-26D development wells in the Costayaco Field, and the Moqueta-17 and Moqueta-21D development wells in the Moqueta Field, as oil producers. The Moqueta-19i well was completed as a water injector as planned.

We encountered approximately six feet of oil pay above the oil-water contact in the Vivian Sandstone Reservoir. This oil column was less than what we had estimated prior to drilling. As previously discussed, in February 2015, we ceased all further development expenditures in the Breta\u00f1a Field on Block 95 other than what is necessary to maintain tangible asset integrity and security. Prior to the decision to cease further development expenditures in the Breta\u00f1a Field, we continued construction of the long-term test facilities, continued the FEED study for full field development and completed a workover on the water disposal well Breta\u00f1a Norte 95-2-1XD ST on this field.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On Blocks 107 and 133 (100% WI, operated), we continued the environmental permitting process.

Both of these planning activities were suspended at the end of February 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutlook - Peru\nOur base 2016 capital program in Peru is $6 million and includes only those activities required for retention of lands and security of assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $145.3 million compared with $331.8 million at December 31, 2014, and $428.8 million at December 31, 2013.\nWe believe that our cash resources, including cash on hand and cash generated from operations, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our strategic objectives and planned capital program for 2016, given current oil price trends and production levels. In accordance with our investment policy, cash balances are held in our primary cash management bank in interest earning current accounts or are invested in U.S. or Canadian government-backed federal, provincial or state securities or other money market instruments with high credit ratings and short-term liquidity. We believe that our current financial position provides us the flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions.\nAt December 31, 2015, 92% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by subsidiaries and partnerships outside of Canada and the United States. This cash was generally not available to fund domestic or head office operations unless funds were repatriated. At this time, we do not intend to repatriate further funds, but if we did, we might have to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain jurisdictions on the distribution of accumulated earnings. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested and a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.\nThe government in Brazil requires us to register funds that enter and exit the country with its central bank. In Brazil and Colombia, all transactions must be carried out in the local currency of the country. In Colombia, we participate in a special exchange regime, which allows us to receive revenue in U.S. dollars offshore. We may also pay invoices denominated in U.S. dollars for our Colombian business from these U.S. dollars received offshore. In Peru, expenditures may be paid in local currency or U.S. dollars.\nWe have a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. Availability under the credit facility is determined by a proven reserves-based borrowing base, and remains subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent set forth in the credit agreement. Loans under the credit agreement will mature on September 18, 2018. The initial borrowing base is $200 million and the borrowing base will be re-determined semi-annually based on reserve evaluation reports, subject to a maximum of $500 million. The borrowing base for the credit facility is supported by the present value of the petroleum reserves of two of our subsidiaries with operating branches in Colombia. The credit agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $100 million. Amounts drawn down under the facility bear interest, at our option, at the USD LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 2.00% and\n3.00% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% per annum to 2.00% per annum, in each case based on the borrowing base utilization percentage. Undrawn amounts under the credit facility bear interest at 0.75% per annum, based on the average daily amount of unused commitments. A letter of credit participation fee of 0.25% per annum will accrue on the average daily amount of letter of credit exposure. Under the terms of the credit facility, we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial and operating covenants which include: the maintenance of a ratio of debt, including letters of credit, to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses (\"EBITDAX\") not to exceed 4.00 to 1.0; the maintenance of a ratio of senior secured obligations to EBITDAX not to exceed 3.00 to 1.00; and the maintenance of a ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense of at least 2.5 to 1.0. As at December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants in our credit agreement. No amounts have been drawn on this facility. This credit facility was entered into and became effective on September 18, 2015, and replaced our previous credit facility which was canceled on this date. Under the terms of the credit facility, we cannot pay any dividends to our shareholders if we are in default under the facility and, if we are not in default, we are required to obtain bank approval for dividend payments to shareholders outside of the credit facility group.\nCash Flows\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $186.5 million as a result of cash used in investing activities of $233.0 million, cash used in financing activities of $9.3 million and foreign exchange loss on cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 million, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $62.3 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $97.0 million as a result of cash used in investing activities of $316.8 million (including $30.4 million cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations) and foreign exchange loss on cash and cash equivalents of $7.5 million, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $216.2 million (including $4.8 million of cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations) and cash provided by financing activities of $11.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $216.2 million as a result of cash provided by operating activities of $523.6 million (including $31.1 million of cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations) and cash provided by financing activities of $3.8 million, partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $308.5 million (including $18.8 million cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations) and foreign exchange loss on cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 million.\nCash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily affected by decreased oil and natural gas sales, higher transportation, severance and equity tax expenses, cash outflow on settlement of foreign currency derivatives, partially offset by decreased operating, and G&A and income tax expenses and higher realized foreign exchange gains. The main changes in assets and liabilities from operating activities were as follows: accounts receivable decreased by $44.4 million primarily due to lower oil and gas sales; inventory increased by $1.6 million primarily due to higher inventory volumes as a result of OTA pipeline disruptions, partially offset by lower inventory costs per bbl; accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $34.5 million due to the timing of payments for drilling activity; and net taxes payable decreased by $48.3 million primarily due to lower current income taxes for 2015 in Colombia.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily affected by\ndecreased oil and natural gas sales, increased transportation and G&A expenses and lower realized foreign exchange gain, partially offset by decreased operating and income tax expenses and cash inflows on settlement of foreign currency derivatives. The main changes in assets and liabilities from operating activities were as follows: accounts receivable increased by $34.5 million primarily due to an increase in the number of days of sales outstanding in Colombia as a result of a higher portion of sales being to Ecopetrol which has longer payment terms than our other significant customers; inventory increased by $2.9 million primarily due to the timing of recognition of oil sales to a customer in Colombia where the sale is not recognized until the customer exports oil; accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $0.6 million due to the timing of payments for drilling activity and higher accruals for trucking costs; and net taxes payable decreased by $61.1 million primarily due to payment of 2013 income taxes in Colombia and lower current income taxes for 2014 in Colombia.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily affected by increased oil and natural gas sales, decreased G&A expenses, decreased realized foreign exchange losses and a $146.6 million change in assets and liabilities from operating activities. These increases were partially offset by increased operating and income tax expenses. The main changes in assets and liabilities from operating activities were as follows: accounts receivable and other long-term assets decreased by $59.0 million primarily due to a reduction in the number of days of sales outstanding in Colombia which resulted from a larger portion of sales in 2013 being to a customer with more favorable payment terms; inventory decreased by $14.2 million primarily due to the reduced oil inventory in the OTA pipeline and associated Ecopetrol\noperated facilities in the Putumayo Basin and reduced oil inventory related to the timing of recognition of oil sales to a short-term customer in Colombia; accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $8.8 million due to the timing of payments for drilling activity; and net taxes payable increased by $84.7 million due to increased taxable income in Colombia and the reimbursement of value added tax receivable in Colombia.\nCash outflows from investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, included capital expenditures of $156.6 million and $76.8 million of net cash outflows related to changes in assets and liabilities associated with investing activities, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $0.5 million. Cash outflows from investing activities of continuing operations in the year ended year ended December 31, 2014, included capital expenditures of $391.5 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.1 million, partially offset by $44.5 million of net cash inflows related to changes in assets and liabilities associated with investing activities. Cash outflows from investing activities of continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2013, included capital expenditures of $345.9 million, and an increase in restricted cash of $1.6 million, partially offset by $2.3 million of net cash inflows related to changes in assets and liabilities associated with investing activities and proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties of $55.5 million.\nCash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the repurchase of shares of our Common Stock pursuant to a normal course issuer bid, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of stock options Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 related to proceeds from issuance of shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of stock options.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a schedule by year of purchase obligations, future minimum payments for firm agreements and leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands of U.S. Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil transportation services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling, completions and seismic\n</td> <td>7,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>7,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software and telecommunication\n</td> <td>479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above table does not reflect estimated amounts expected to be incurred in the future associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties and other long-term liabilities, as we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of such payments. Information regarding our asset retirement obligation can be found in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligation, in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d,\nAt December 31, 2015, we had provided promissory notes totaling $76.5 million as security for letters of credit relating to work commitment guarantees contained in exploration contracts and other capital or operating requirements.\nAs is customary in the oil and gas industry, we may at times have commitments in place to reserve or earn certain acreage positions or wells. If we do not meet such commitments, the acreage positions or wells may be lost and associated penalties may be payable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements under GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the revenues and expenses reported and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Changes in these estimates related to judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information, and, accordingly, actual results could differ from amounts estimated.\nOn a regular basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nCertain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes; and (b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. The areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made are discussed below.\nFull Cost Method of Accounting, Proved Reserves, DD&A and Impairments of Oil and Gas Properties\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10, as described in Note 2 to our annual consolidated financial statements. Under the full cost method of accounting, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of properties are capitalized, including internal costs directly attributable to these activities. The sum of net capitalized costs, including estimated asset retirement obligations (\"ARO\"), and estimated future development costs to be incurred in developing proved reserves are depleted using the unit-of-production method.\nCompanies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation. The ceiling test limits pooled costs to the aggregate of the discounted estimated after-tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties, plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects.\nIf our net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, is in excess of the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written off as an expense. Any such write-down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower DD&A expenses in future periods. The ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. An expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.\nOur estimates of proved oil and gas reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations. Additionally, our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of production and the amount and timing of future expenditures. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data.\nWe believe our assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time we prepare our estimates. However, these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change.\nManagement is responsible for estimating the quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and for preparing related disclosures. Estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with SEC requirements and generally accepted industry practices in the United States as prescribed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Reserve estimates are evaluated at least annually by independent qualified reserves consultants.\nWhile the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the associated prices of oil and natural gas and the applicable discount rate, that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that a 10% discount factor be used and future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent the average of the first day of each month price for the 12-month period. Therefore, the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs, but reflect adjustments for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market. Estimates of standardized measure of our future cash flows from proved reserves for our December 31, 2015, ceiling tests were based on wellhead prices per BOE as of the first day of each month within that twelve month period of $43.51 for Colombia and $37.72 for Brazil.\nBecause the ceiling test calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10% discount factor, the resulting value should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties. Historical oil and gas prices for any particular 12-month period can be either higher or lower than our price forecast. Therefore, oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation, and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves.\nOur Reserves Committee oversees the annual review of our oil and gas reserves and related disclosures. The Board meets with management periodically to review the reserves process, results and related disclosures and appoints and meets with the independent reserves consultants to review the scope of their work, whether they have had access to sufficient information, the nature and satisfactory resolution of any material differences of opinion, and in the case of the independent reserves consultants, their independence.\nWe assessed our oil and gas properties for impairment as at December 31, 2015, and recorded ceiling test impairment losses of $232.4 million in our Colombia cost center, and $46.9 million in our Brazil cost center, related to lower oil prices. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we also recorded impairment losses in our Peru cost center of $41.9 million, related to costs incurred on Block 95. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an impairment loss of unproved properties in our Peru cost center of $265.1 million due to the lack of continued investment planned for Block 95. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a ceiling test impairment loss of $2.0 million in our Brazil cost center as a result of lower realized prices and increased operating costs.\nHolding all factors constant other than benchmark oil prices, it is reasonably likely that we will experience ceiling test impairment losses in our Brazil and Colombia cost centers in the first quarter of 2016. The calculation excludes the effect of our acquisitions of Petroamerica and PGC which closed subsequent to year end.\nIt is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairment losses given the many factors impacting the asset base and the cash flows used in the prescribed U.S. GAAP ceiling test calculation. These factors include, but are not limited to, future commodity pricing, royalty rates in different pricing environments, operating costs and negotiated savings, foreign exchange rates, capital expenditures timing and negotiated savings, production and its impact on depletion and cost base, upward or downward reserve revisions as a result of ongoing exploration and development activity, and tax attributes. Subject to these factors and inherent limitations, we believe that ceiling test impairment losses in the first quarter of 2016 could exceed $8 million in Brazil and $131 million in Colombia. The calculation of the impact of lower commodity prices on our estimated ceiling test calculation was prepared based on the presumption that all other inputs and assumptions are held constant with the exception of benchmark oil prices. Therefore, this calculation strictly isolates the impact of commodity prices on the prescribed GAAP ceiling test. This calculation was based on pro forma Brent oil price of $48.82 per bbl for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. These pro forma oil prices were calculated using a 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of oil prices, and included the oil prices on the first day of the month for the nine months ended December 2015, and, for the three months ended March 2016, estimated oil prices using the forward price curve forecast for the first quarter of 2015 of our independent reserves evaluator dated January 1, 2016.\nAs noted above, actual cash flows may be materially affected by other factors. For example, in Colombia, cash royalties are levied at lower rates in low oil price environments and foreign exchange rates can materially impact the deferred tax component of the asset base, operating costs, and the income tax calculation. In Brazil, foreign exchange rates can materially impact operating costs and the income tax calculation.\nHolding all factors constant other than benchmark oil prices and related royalty rates, we do not expect any downward adjustment to our consolidated NAR reserve volumes during the first quarter of 2016. This disclosure is based on a pro forma Brent oil price of $48.82 per bbl for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016, calculated as described above.\nUnproved properties\nUnproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves. Costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined. Unproved properties are evaluated quarterly to ascertain whether impairment has occurred. Unproved properties, the costs of which are individually significant, are assessed individually by considering seismic data, plans or requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results and activity, remaining time in the commitment period, remaining capital plans and political, economic and market conditions. Where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant, these properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment. During any period in which factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative costs incurred to date for such property are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization. The transfer of costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on our drilling plans and results, seismic evaluations, the assignment of proved reserves, availability of capital and other factors. For countries where a reserve base has not yet been established, the impairment is charged to earnings.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe are required to remove or remedy the effect of our activities on the environment at our present and former operating sites by dismantling and removing production facilities and remediating any damage caused. Estimating our future ARO requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to activities that will occur many years into the future. In addition, the ultimate financial impact of environmental laws and regulations is not always clearly known and cannot be reasonably estimated as standards evolve in the countries in which we operate.\nWe record ARO in our consolidated financial statements by discounting the present value of the estimated retirement obligations associated with our oil and gas wells and facilities. In arriving at amounts recorded, we make numerous assumptions and judgments with respect to the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO, estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements, inflation factors, credit-adjusted risk-free discount rates and changes in legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. Because costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. In periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, we must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized costs, including revisions thereto, are charged to expense through DD&A.\nIt is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one of our assumptions. As a result, we are unable to provide a reasonable sensitivity analysis of the impact a change in our assumptions would have on our financial results.\nAllocation of Consideration Transferred in Business Combinations\nThe acquisition of properties in Brazil in 2012 was accounted for using the acquisition method, with Gran Tierra being the acquirer, whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration transferred was equal to the fair value of the net assets acquired and no gain or goodwill was recorded on acquisition. Calculation of fair values of assets and liabilities, which was done with the assistance of independent advisors, was subject to estimates which include various assumptions including the fair value of proved and unproved reserves of the assets acquired as well as future production and development costs and future oil and gas prices.\nWhile these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources, they can have an effect on the future results of operations. Generally, the higher the fair value assigned to both oil and gas properties and non-oil and gas properties, the lower future net income will be as a result of higher future DD&A expenses. Also, a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties, based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices, will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling write down in the event that future oil and gas prices drop below the price forecast used to originally determine fair value.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The goodwill on our balance sheet resulted from the Solana Resources Limited and Argosy Energy International L.P. acquisitions, in 2008 and 2006 respectively, and relates entirely to the Colombia reporting unit.\nAt each reporting date, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Changes in our future cash flows, operating results, growth rates, capital expenditures, cost of capital, discount rates, stock price or related market capitalization, could affect the results of our annual goodwill assessment and, accordingly, potentially lead to future goodwill impairment charges.\nThe two-step goodwill impairment test would require a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the net book value of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value, including goodwill, we would write down the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. The most significant judgments involved in estimating the fair values of our reporting units would relate to the valuation of our property and equipment. A lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge. Unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge. A goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources. However, it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period.\nAt December 31, 2015, we performed a valuation of our Colombia reporting unit and passed the first step of the goodwill impairment test at each of the low, medium, and high valuation cases. Ceiling test impairment losses in our Colombian cost center of $232.4 million net of the associated deferred tax recovery of $91.7 million reduced the carrying value of the reporting unit in 2015 by $140.7 million. Additionally, forward curve oil prices as at December 31, 2015, were higher after the first two years of cash flows than those used in the ceiling test impairment calculation. This reduction in carrying value combined with increased reserves and forward curve oil prices as at December 31, 2015, resulted in no impairment of goodwill.\nIncome Taxes\nWe follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and other types of carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe carry on business in several countries and as a result, we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. The determination of our income tax provision is inherently complex and we are required to interpret continually changing regulations and make certain judgments. While income tax filings are subject to audits and reassessments, we believe we have made adequate provision for all income tax obligations. However, changes in facts and circumstances as a result of income tax audits, reassessments, jurisprudence and any new legislation may result in an increase or decrease in our provision for income taxes.\nTo assess the realization of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. An estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item. We consider the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when it is more likely than not that we will not realize the full tax benefit of the position. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.\nWe routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and establish accruals for such amounts.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nA provision for legal and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management. In many cases, management's judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and/or courts of law. Management closely monitors known and potential legal and other contingencies and periodically determines when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. The compensation cost is recognized net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period. GAAP requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nWe utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of all of our stock options. The use of such models requires substantial judgment with respect to expected life, volatility, expected returns and other factors. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our shares. We use historical experience for exercises to determine expected life. We are responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share based payment awards.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". The ASU creates a single source of revenue guidance for all companies in all industries and requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. The amendments in the ASU can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date\". The ASU defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition model by one year. As a result, the guidance will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosure.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\". The ASU provides guidance for the subsequent measurement of inventory and requires that inventory that is measured using average cost be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The ASU will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The implementation of this update is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows or disclosure.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, \"Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\". ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Prospective adoption is required. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows or disclosure.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, \"Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\". ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as long-term in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We implemented this update retrospectively in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, so that the balance sheet is presented on a comparable basis. Deferred tax liabilities and assets of $1.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, have been reclassified from current to long-term in our December 31, 2014 balance sheet. The implementation of this update did not impact our consolidated results of operations or cash flows.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, \"Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\". ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows or disclosure.", "item_7_truncated": "Oil and gas sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased to $559.4 million from $647.0 million in 2013 as a result of the combined effect of decreased sales and realized prices. Average realized prices decreased by 10% to $82.74 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2014, from $92.13 per BOE for 2013. Average Brent oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $99.02 per bbl compared with $108.64 per bbl in 2013. WTI oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $93.00 per bbl compared with $97.97 per bbl in 2013. Additionally, beginning July 1, 2014, the port operations fee component of the OTA pipeline pricing structure increased by $2.94 per bbl resulting in a reduction of realized oil prices by this amount on sales delivered through the OTA pipeline. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 52% of our oil and gas volumes sold in Colombia were through alternative transportation routes alternatives compared with 64% in 2013.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, thousands of U.S. Dollars\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, U.S. Dollars Per BOE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, thousands of U.S. Dollars\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, U.S. Dollars Per BOE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colombia\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil\n</td> <td>6,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Peru\n</td> <td>789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>1,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, thousands of U.S. Dollars\n</td> <td>DD&A expenses, U.S. Dollars Per BOE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colombia\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil\n</td> <td>14,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Peru\n</td> <td>362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>1,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Daily Volumes (BOEPD) -

$91.2 million, or $12.99 per BOE, in 2013. Operating expenses per BOE increased in 2014 primarily due to increased workover expenses.\nIt is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairment losses given the many factors impacting the asset base and the cash flows used in the prescribed U.S. GAAP ceiling test calculation. These factors include, but are not limited to, future commodity pricing, royalty rates in different pricing environments, operating costs and negotiated savings, foreign exchange rates, capital expenditures timing and negotiated savings, production and its impact on depletion and cost base, upward or downward reserve revisions as a result of ongoing exploration and development activity, and tax attributes. Subject to these factors and inherent limitations, we believe that ceiling test impairment losses in the first quarter of 2016 could exceed $8 million in Brazil and $131 million in Colombia. The calculation of the impact of lower commodity prices on our estimated ceiling test calculation was prepared based on the presumption that all other inputs and assumptions are held constant with the exception of benchmark oil prices. Therefore, this calculation strictly isolates the impact of commodity prices on the prescribed GAAP ceiling test. This calculation was based on pro forma Brent oil price of $48.82 per bbl for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. These pro forma oil prices were calculated using a 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of oil prices, and included the oil prices on the first day of the month for the nine months ended December 2015, and, for the three months ended March 2016, estimated oil prices using the forward price curve forecast for the first quarter of 2015 of our independent reserves evaluator dated January 1, 2016.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds Flow From Continuing Operations - Non-GAAP Measure ($000s)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(268,029\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(171,339\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to funds flow from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DD&A expenses\n</td> <td>176,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment\n</td> <td>323,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax (recovery) expense\n</td> <td>(115,442\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,865\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>2,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial instruments loss\n</td> <td>2,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized foreign exchange gain\n</td> <td>(8,380\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,941\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash settlement of foreign currency derivatives\n</td> <td>(3,749\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other loss\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other gain\n</td> <td>(502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity tax\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,283\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds flow from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>319,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2) Operating netback as presented is oil and gas sales net of royalties and operating and transportation expenses.

In the year ended December 31, 2014, we had income tax expense despite having losses from continuing operations. In 2014, our loss before income taxes was primarily due to impairment losses in Peru which were fully offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014 was primarily due to a smaller increase in the valuation allowance as a result of lower impairment losses in Peru where there is a full valuation allowance and an increase in foreign currency translation adjustments. Additionally, our income tax expense in 2014 reflected the impact of future income tax rate changes in Colombia on our deferred tax liability. In 2014, tax legislation was enacted in Colombia which increased the 2015 to 2018 tax rates resulting in an increase of the Colombian deferred tax liability of approximately $31.0 million.\nTable 67:

Another threat comes from criminal gangs formed from the former members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia militia, a paramilitary group that originally sprouted up to combat FARC and ELN, which the Colombian government successfully dissolved. We operate principally in the Putumayo Basin in Colombia. Pipelines have been primary targets because such pipelines cannot be adequately secured due to the sheer length of such pipelines and the remoteness of the areas in which the pipelines are laid. The CENIT S.A-operated Trans-Andean oil pipeline (the \"OTA pipeline\u201d) which transports oil from the Putumayo region and which is one of our export routes, has been targeted by these guerrilla groups.

Argentina production for the year ended December 31, 2014, was calculated to the date of sale of June 25, 2014.\nDD&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, decreased to $176.4 million from $185.9 million in 2014. On a per BOE basis, the depletion rate decreased by 4% to $26.47 from $27.49. On a per BOE basis, the decrease was due to lower costs in the depletable base and increased proved reserves at year end.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands of U.S. Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of oil and gas properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colombia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Peru\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur base 2016 capital program in Colombia is $76 million and includes two water injector wells in the Costayaco Field and three development wells in the Moqueta Field, both on the Chaza Block (100% WI, operated), two exploration wells and a development well in the Putumayo-7 Block (subject to regulatory approval, 100% WI, operated) and an exploration well in the Llanos-10 Block (50% WI, non-operated). The Llanos-10 exploration well is being drilled by an industry partner and our share of the cost is expected to be less than $0.5 million. Facilities work is also planned for the Chaza Block.\n \u2022 On the Chaza Block (100% working interest (\"WI\"), operated), we drilled and completed the Costayaco-25D and Costayaco-26D development wells in the Costayaco Field, and the Moqueta-17 and Moqueta-21D development wells in the Moqueta Field, as oil producers. The Moqueta-19i well was completed as a water injector as planned. We commenced drilling the Costayaco-24D and Costayaco-27i development well and started pre-drilling activities for the Moqueta-20, 22 and 23 development wells. We also drilled the Moqueta-18i development well and encountered mechanical difficulties. The well is currently suspended. \nOn January 13, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Petroamerica Oil Corp (\"Petroamerica\") for cash consideration of $70.6 million and the issuance of 13,656,719 shares of Gran Tierra common stock with a value of $25.8 million. On January 25, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of PetroGranada Colombia Limited (\"PGC\") for a net purchase price of $19.0 million, after giving consideration to estimated net working capital of $18.7 million. In addition, we agreed to pay contingent consideration of $4.0 million if cumulative production from the Putumayo-7 Block plus gross proved plus probable reserves under the Putumayo-7 Block meet or exceed 8 MMbbl. Combined proved NAR oil and gas reserves of Petroamerica and PGC as at December 31, 2015, were 3.9 MMBOE.\nAt December 31, 2015, 92% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by subsidiaries and partnerships outside of Canada and the United States. This cash was generally not available to fund domestic or head office operations unless funds were repatriated. At this time, we do not intend to repatriate further funds, but if we did, we might have to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain jurisdictions on the distribution of accumulated earnings. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested and a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.\n(5) In 2013, capital expenditures are net of proceeds of $54.0 million relating to termination of a farm-in agreement in Brazil; and $1.5 million relating to the sale of our working interest of a block in Colombia.\n\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\". The ASU provides guidance for the subsequent measurement of inventory and requires that inventory that is measured using average cost be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The ASU will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The implementation of this update is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows or disclosure.\nCapital Program - Colombia\nConsolidated Results of Continuing Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015, Compared with the Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nIn January 2016, we announced our 2016 capital budget. Our base 2016 capital program of $107 million consists of: $76 million for Colombia; $8 million for Brazil; $6 million for Peru; and $17 million for other.\nOil prices are volatile and unpredictable and influenced by concerns over world supply and demand imbalance and many other market factors outside of our control. Oil prices started falling in July 2014 and fell dramatically during the period December 2014 to March 2015. Prices have remained low and volatile. During 2015, the average price realized for our oil was $41.56 per bbl (2014 - $83.22; 2013 - $92.31). Average Brent oil price for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $52.35 per bbl compared with $99.02 per bbl in 2014 and $108.64 in 2013. Average West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") oil price for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $48.78 per bbl compared with $93.00 per bbl in 2014 and $97.97 in 2013.\nWe assessed our oil and gas properties for impairment as at December 31, 2015, and recorded ceiling test impairment losses of $232.4 million in our Colombia cost center, and $46.9 million in our Brazil cost center, related to lower oil prices. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we also recorded impairment losses in our Peru cost center of $41.9 million, related to costs incurred on Block 95. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an impairment loss of unproved properties in our Peru cost center of $265.1 million due to the lack of continued investment planned for Block 95. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a ceiling test impairment loss of $2.0 million in our Brazil cost center as a result of lower realized prices and increased operating costs.\nDD&A Expenses\nOur base 2016 capital program in Peru is $6 million and includes only those activities required for retention of lands and security of assets.\nThe credit markets, including the high yield bond market and other debt markets that provide capital to oil and gas companies have experienced adverse conditions. We have not been materially impacted by these conditions; however, continuing volatility in oil prices may continue to contribute to these adverse conditions, which could increase costs associated with renewing or issuing debt or affect our ability to access those markets.\nOutlook - Peru\n\n\n(3) EBITDA, as presented, is net income or loss adjusted for loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, depletion, depreciation and accretion ( DD&A\u201d) expenses, asset impairment and income tax recovery or expense. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for foreign exchange gains. Management uses these financial measures to analyze performance and income or loss generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of how non-cash items affect that income or loss, and believes that these financial measures are also useful supplemental information for investors to analyze performance and our financial results. A reconciliation from net income or loss to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nAt December 31, 2015, we had provided promissory notes totaling $76.5 million as security for letters of credit relating to work commitment guarantees contained in exploration contracts and other capital or operating requirements.\nHolding all factors constant other than benchmark oil prices, it is reasonably likely that we will experience ceiling test impairment losses in our Brazil and Colombia cost centers in the first quarter of 2016. The calculation excludes the effect of our acquisitions of Petroamerica and PGC which closed subsequent to year end.\n\nThe above table does not reflect estimated amounts expected to be incurred in the future associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties and other long-term liabilities, as we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of such payments. Information regarding our asset retirement obligation can be found in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligation, in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d,\nForeign currency derivative gains and losses related to our Colombian peso non-deliverable forward contracts. We purchased these contracts for purposes of fixing the exchange rate at which we would purchase or sell Colombian pesos to settle our income tax installments and payments. At December 30, 2015, we did not have any open foreign currency derivative positions.\n2016 Capital Program\nAs previously discussed, all probable and possible reserves associated with the Breta\u00f1a Field on Block 95 in Peru were reclassified as contingent resources in a report with an effective date of January 31, 2015. These reserves are excluded from the table above. Estimated proved, probable and possible oil and gas reserves, NAR, as at December 31, 2013, included 4.4, 2.1 and 10.3 MMBOE, respectively, in Argentina.\nIn 2015 in Colombia, production from new wells in the Moqueta Field in the Chaza Block and increased production from the Jilguero Field in the Garibay Block, as a result of the unitization of that field and new wells coming on stream, was offset by the impact of normal field production declines in the Costayaco Field in the Chaza Block and the Juanambu Field in the Guayuyaco Block. Production during the year ended December 31, 2015, reflected approximately 213 days of OTA pipeline disruptions in Colombia compared with 180 days in 2014. Despite the OTA pipeline being down for 213 days we did not have to shut in any production in 2015 due to the different routes available to transport our crude oil.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Guidry replaced Duncan Nightingale in that role, who was serving as interim Chief Executive Officer since February 2015 and, with the appointment of Mr. Guidry as Chief Executive Officer, was designated as Executive Vice President until February 19, 2016, when he ceased performing this role. Additionally, effective May 11, 2015, Ryan Ellson was appointed as Chief Financial Officer. In connection with our entry into the Agreement, the size of our Board of Directors was expanded, new directors were appointed to fill the newly created vacancies and certain existing directors agreed not to stand for re-election at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders. In June 2015, our Board of Directors approved a new capital program focusing on development activities in Colombia.\n(1) Operating netback is a non-GAAP measure which does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP. Refer to non-GAAP measures disclosure above regarding this measure.\nCapital expenditures in our Colombian segment during the year ended December 31, 2015, were $87.7 million, including drilling of $60.5 million, facilities of $13.6 million, seismic expenditures of $6.2 million and $7.4 million of other expenditures.\nNon-GAAP measures\n\nWe are required to remove or remedy the effect of our activities on the environment at our present and former operating sites by dismantling and removing production facilities and remediating any damage caused. Estimating our future ARO requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to activities that will occur many years into the future. In addition, the ultimate financial impact of environmental laws and regulations is not always clearly known and cannot be reasonably estimated as standards evolve in the countries in which we operate.\nAs is customary in the oil and gas industry, we may at times have commitments in place to reserve or earn certain acreage positions or wells. If we do not meet such commitments, the acreage positions or wells may be lost and associated penalties may be payable.\nTransportation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $40.2 million, or $6.03 per BOE, compared with $24.2 million, or $3.58 per BOE, in 2014. On a per BOE basis, transportation expenses increased by 68%. The increase in transportation expenses per BOE was primarily due to the alternative transportation routes used during periods of OTA pipeline disruptions. During 2015, we used new alternative transportation routes which carried higher transportation costs, but higher realized prices compared with other customers.\nTrading securities losses related to unrealized losses on the Madalena Energy Inc. (\"Madalena\") shares we received in connection with the sale of our Argentina business unit in June 2014.\nCapital Program - Brazil\nWhile peace talks continue between the Colombian government and the FARC, peace process negotiations between the government and FARC may not generate the intended outcome for both parties, though the Colombian government has stated that a resolution is expected to be reached during the first quarter of 2016. The impact of such a peace process is not determinable on our operations. Continuing attempts by the Colombian government to reduce or prevent guerrilla activity may not be successful and guerrilla activity may continue to disrupt our operations in the future. Our efforts to increase security measures may not be successful and there can also be no assurance that we can maintain the safety of our or our contractors' field personnel and Bogota head office personnel or operations in Colombia or that this violence will not continue to adversely affect our operations in the future and cause significant loss.\nAsset Impairment\nOur future growth and acquisitions may depend on our ability to raise additional funds through equity and debt markets. Should we be required to raise debt or equity financing to fund capital expenditures or other acquisition and development opportunities, such funding may be affected by the market value of shares of our Common Stock. The current low and volatile oil price has had a negative impact on the value of shares of our Common Stock. Also, raising funds by issuing shares or other equity securities would further dilute our existing shareholders, and this dilution would be exacerbated by a decline in our share price. Any securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to our existing equity securities. Borrowing money may also involve further pledging of some or all of our assets, may require compliance with debt covenants and will expose us to interest rate risk. Depending on the currency used to borrow money, we may also be exposed to further foreign exchange risk. Our ability to borrow money and the interest rate we pay for any money we borrow will be affected by market conditions and we cannot predict what price we may pay for any borrowed money.\ndecreased oil and natural gas sales, increased transportation and G&A expenses and lower realized foreign exchange gain, partially offset by decreased operating and income tax expenses and cash inflows on settlement of foreign currency derivatives. The main changes in assets and liabilities from operating activities were as follows: accounts receivable increased by $34.5 million primarily due to an increase in the number of days of sales outstanding in Colombia as a result of a higher portion of sales being to Ecopetrol which has longer payment terms than our other significant customers; inventory increased by $2.9 million primarily due to the timing of recognition of oil sales to a customer in Colombia where the sale is not recognized until the customer exports oil; accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $0.6 million due to the timing of payments for drilling activity and higher accruals for trucking costs; and net taxes payable decreased by $61.1 million primarily due to payment of 2013 income taxes in Colombia and lower current income taxes for 2014 in Colombia.\nFull Cost Method of Accounting, Proved Reserves, DD&A and Impairments of Oil and Gas Properties\nOn May 7, 2015, we entered into an agreement (the Agreement\u201d) with West Face SPV (Cayman) I L.P. ( West Face\u201d) pursuant to which we settled a proxy contest. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Gary Guidry was appointed as our\nSeverance Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, funds flow from continuing operations decreased by 8% from $348.0 million to $319.6 million primarily due to decreased oil and natural gas sales, increased transportation and G&A expenses and lower realized foreign exchange gains, partially offset by decreased operating and income tax expenses and cash inflows on settlement of foreign currency derivatives.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCash outflows from investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, included capital expenditures of $156.6 million and $76.8 million of net cash outflows related to changes in assets and liabilities associated with investing activities, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $0.5 million. Cash outflows from investing activities of continuing operations in the year ended year ended December 31, 2014, included capital expenditures of $391.5 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.1 million, partially offset by $44.5 million of net cash inflows related to changes in assets and liabilities associated with investing activities. Cash outflows from investing activities of continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2013, included capital expenditures of $345.9 million, and an increase in restricted cash of $1.6 million, partially offset by $2.3 million of net cash inflows related to changes in assets and liabilities associated with investing activities and proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties of $55.5 million.\nThe variance from the 35% U.S. statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance, a non-deductible third party royalty in Colombia, the impact of local taxes, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by other permanent differences, foreign currency translation adjustments and the foreign tax rate differential.\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $75.6 million, or $11.34 per BOE, compared with $89.8 million, or $13.28 per BOE in 2014. On a per BOE basis, operating expenses decreased by 15%. The decrease in operating expenses per BOE in 2015 was primarily due to Colombian operating cost savings and the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies in South America. In Brazil, in the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $1.7 million, or $8.98 per bbl based on volumes sold in Brazil, of one-time penalties relating to alleged non-compliance with certain requirements regarding the health and safety management system, identified during a safety and operational audit conducted by the ANP in early 2015.\nOutlook - Brazil\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, \"Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\". ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Prospective adoption is required. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows or disclosure.\nWe believe our assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time we prepare our estimates. However, these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWhile these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources, they can have an effect on the future results of operations. Generally, the higher the fair value assigned to both oil and gas properties and non-oil and gas properties, the lower future net income will be as a result of higher future DD&A expenses. Also, a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties, based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices, will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling write down in the event that future oil and gas prices drop below the price forecast used to originally determine fair value.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily affected by increased oil and natural gas sales, decreased G&A expenses, decreased realized foreign exchange losses and a $146.6 million change in assets and liabilities from operating activities. These increases were partially offset by increased operating and income tax expenses. The main changes in assets and liabilities from operating activities were as follows: accounts receivable and other long-term assets decreased by $59.0 million primarily due to a reduction in the number of days of sales outstanding in Colombia which resulted from a larger portion of sales in 2013 being to a customer with more favorable payment terms; inventory decreased by $14.2 million primarily due to the reduced oil inventory in the OTA pipeline and associated Ecopetrol\n(4) Funds flow from continuing operations, as presented, is net income or loss adjusted for loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, DD&A expenses, asset impairment, deferred tax recovery or expense, non-cash stock-based compensation, financial instrument loss, unrealized foreign exchange gains, cash settlement of foreign currency derivatives, other gains and losses and equity tax. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our new management changed our method of calculating funds flow from continuing operations to be more consistent with our peers. Funds flow from continuing operations is no longer net of cash settlement of asset retirement obligation. Additionally, foreign exchange losses on cash and cash equivalents have been excluded from funds flow. Comparative information has been reclassified to be calculated on a consistent basis. Management uses this financial measure to analyze performance and income or loss generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of how non-cash items affect that income or loss, and believes that this financial measure is also useful supplemental information for investors to analyze performance and our financial results. A reconciliation from net income or loss to funds flow from continuing operations is as follows:\nCapital expenditures in our Brazilian segment during the year ended December 31, 2015, were $20.0 million, including drilling of $0.8 million, facilities of $5.6 million, seismic of $10.1 million and $3.5 million of other expenditures.\nThe significant elements of our 2015 capital program in Colombia were:\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOperating Netbacks\nWhile the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the associated prices of oil and natural gas and the applicable discount rate, that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that a 10% discount factor be used and future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent the average of the first day of each month price for the 12-month period. Therefore, the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs, but reflect adjustments for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market. Estimates of standardized measure of our future cash flows from proved reserves for our December 31, 2015, ceiling tests were based on wellhead prices per BOE as of the first day of each month within that twelve month period of $43.51 for Colombia and $37.72 for Brazil.\nCash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the repurchase of shares of our Common Stock pursuant to a normal course issuer bid, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of stock options Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 related to proceeds from issuance of shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of stock options.\nOil and gas sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, decreased to $276.0 million from $559.4 million in 2014 primarily as a result of the effect of decreased realized prices. Average realized prices decreased by 50% to $41.41 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $82.74 per BOE for 2014 primarily due to lower benchmark oil prices. Average Brent oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $52.35 per bbl compared with $99.02 per bbl in 2014. WTI oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $48.78 per bbl compared with $93.00 per bbl in 2014.\nOn a regular basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nFinancial Instrument Gains and Losses\nOil and gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased by 4% to 18,523 BOEPD compared with 19,239 BOEPD in 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, an oil inventory increase in 2014 accounted for 0.3 MMbbl, or 760 bopd, of reduced sales compared with an oil inventory decrease in 2013 which accounted for 0.1 MMbbl, or 168 bopd, of increased sales.\nWe believe that our current operations and 2016 capital expenditure program can be funded from cash flow from existing operations and cash on hand. Should our operating cash flow decline due to unforeseen events, including additional pipeline delivery restrictions in Colombia or continued downturn in oil and gas prices, we would consider financing our capital expenditure program with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or capital markets transactions, or a combination thereof, or we would consider reducing our capital expenditure program. Given the current economic environment and unstable conditions in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe and the current over supply of oil in world markets, the oil price environment is unpredictable and unstable. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, these events may have on oil prices and demand. The timing and execution of our capital expenditure program are also affected by the availability of services from third party oil field contractors and our ability to obtain, sustain or renew necessary government licenses and permits on a timely basis to conduct exploration and development activities. Any delay may affect our ability to execute our capital expenditure program.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 On Block 95 (100% WI, operated), we completed drilling operations in the Breta\u00f1a Sur 95-3-4-1X appraisal well on the L4 lobe in the Breta\u00f1a Field, which satisfied our work obligation for the fifth exploration period. We encountered approximately six feet of oil pay above the oil-water contact in the Vivian Sandstone Reservoir. This oil column was less than what we had estimated prior to drilling. As previously discussed, in February 2015, we ceased all further development expenditures in the Breta\u00f1a Field on Block 95 other than what is necessary to maintain tangible asset integrity and security. Prior to the decision to cease further development expenditures in the Breta\u00f1a Field, we continued construction of the long-term test facilities, continued the FEED study for full field development and completed a workover on the water disposal well Breta\u00f1a Norte 95-2-1XD ST on this field. \nOn June 25, 2014, we sold our Argentina business unit to Madalena for aggregate consideration of $69.3 million, comprising $55.4 million in cash and $13.9 million in Madalena shares. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we met the criteria to classify our Argentina business unit as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2014. As such, the results of operations for our Argentina business unit are reflected as loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes and discussed further in Note 3, \"Discontinued Operations,\" of our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2015.\nUnproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves. Costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined. Unproved properties are evaluated quarterly to ascertain whether impairment has occurred. Unproved properties, the costs of which are individually significant, are assessed individually by considering seismic data, plans or requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results and activity, remaining time in the commitment period, remaining capital plans and political, economic and market conditions. Where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant, these properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment. During any period in which factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative costs incurred to date for such property are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization. The transfer of costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on our drilling plans and results, seismic evaluations, the assignment of proved reserves, availability of capital and other factors. For countries where a reserve base has not yet been established, the impairment is charged to earnings.\nThe acquisition of properties in Brazil in 2012 was accounted for using the acquisition method, with Gran Tierra being the acquirer, whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration transferred was equal to the fair value of the net assets acquired and no gain or goodwill was recorded on acquisition. Calculation of fair values of assets and liabilities, which was done with the assistance of independent advisors, was subject to estimates which include various assumptions including the fair value of proved and unproved reserves of the assets acquired as well as future production and development costs and future oil and gas prices.\nWe utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of all of our stock options. The use of such models requires substantial judgment with respect to expected life, volatility, expected returns and other factors. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our shares. We use historical experience for exercises to determine expected life. We are responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share based payment awards.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe significant elements of our 2015 capital program in Peru were:\nIncome tax expense was $127.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $128.3 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower taxable income in Colombia and lower taxes in Brazil, partially offset by the impact of future tax rate changes on the Colombian deferred tax liability, as discussed above. In 2013 in Brazil, a net payment of $54.0 million from a third party in connection with the termination of a farm-in agreement resulted in a current tax expense of approximately $10.4 million.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n \u2022 We completed the acquisition of 2-D seismic on the Cauca-7 (100% WI, operated), Sinu-1 (60% WI, operated) and Sinu-3 (51% WI, operated) Blocks and continued activities in preparation for the acquisition of 2-D seismic on the Putumayo-10 Block (100% WI, operated). We also commenced environmental impact assessments (\"EIA\"s) for future drilling on the Sinu-3 Block. \nWe are an independent international energy company incorporated in the United States and engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration, development and production. Our principal business activity is in Colombia and we also have business activities in Peru and Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 97% (year ended December 31, 2014 - 95%; year ended December 31, 2013 - 96%) of our revenue and other income was generated in Colombia. We are headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nWith the exception of reserves and net income, the 2014 and 2013 amounts in the table above exclude amounts relating to discontinued operations. Oil and gas production NAR associated with discontinued operations was nil BOEPD for the year ended December 31, 2015 (2014 - 1,361 BOEPD; 2013 - 3,028 BOEPD). Argentina production for the December 31, 2014, was calculated to the date of sale of June 25, 2014.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, ceiling test impairment losses in our Colombia and Brazil cost centers and inventory impairment losses were primarily due to lower oil prices. The ceiling test impairment loss in our Brazil cost center was recognized during the first three quarters of 2015. As a result of a technical evaluation of the Brazil cost center reserves completed during the fourth quarter of 2015, an upward technical revision in proved reserves resulted in no ceiling test impairment loss during that quarter. Impairment losses in our Peru cost center related to costs incurred on Block 95.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the difference between the effective tax rate of 27% and the 35% U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance, non-deductible third party royalty in Colombia and other local taxes, partially offset by the impact of foreign taxes, foreign currency translation adjustments and other permanent differences.\nG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, of $51.2 million increased by 25% from $41.1 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher salary and consulting expenses associated with increased activity for expanded operations in Peru in 2014.\nFor the years ended December, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had foreign exchange gains of $17.2 million, $39.5 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred taxes are considered a monetary liability and require translation from local\nOil and gas production NAR for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased by 1% to 19,283 BOEPD compared with 19,071 BOEPD in 2013. In 2014 in Colombia, production from new wells in the Moqueta Field in the Chaza Block and a new well in the Llanos-22 Block were partially offset by the impact of well downtime for workovers and a water cut increase in the Costayaco Field in the Chaza Block. Production during the year ended December 31, 2014, reflected approximately 180 days of OTA pipeline disruptions in Colombia compared with 229 days in 2013.\nEquity Tax Expense\nUnproved properties\nOur stock-based compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. The compensation cost is recognized net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period. GAAP requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nForeign Exchange Gains\nWe routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and establish accruals for such amounts.\nTo assess the realization of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nManagement is responsible for estimating the quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and for preparing related disclosures. Estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with SEC requirements and generally accepted industry practices in the United States as prescribed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Reserve estimates are evaluated at least annually by independent qualified reserves consultants.\nTransportation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $24.2 million, or $3.58 per BOE, compared with $18.9 million, or $2.70 per BOE, in 2013. On a per BOE basis, transportation expenses increased by 33%. The increase in transportation expenses per BOE was primarily due to higher transportation costs associated with higher sales using the OTA pipeline which carried higher transportation costs instead of the realized price reductions that we incurred with some alternative customers in 2013.\nIn Colombia, our base 2016 capital program includes two water injector wells in the Costayaco Field and three development wells in the Moqueta Field, both on the Chaza Block (100% WI, operated), two exploration wells and a development well in the Putumayo-7 Block (subject to regulatory approval, 100% WI, operated) and an exploration well on the Llanos-10 Block (50% WI, non-operated) with the costs being carried by a third party. Facilities work is also planned for the Chaza Block.\nWe follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and other types of carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $145.3 million compared with $331.8 million at December 31, 2014, and $428.8 million at December 31, 2013.\nIncome tax recovery was $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 ($15.4 million current income tax expense and $115.4 million deferred income tax recovery), compared with income tax expense of $127.2 million in 2014 ($92.9 million current income tax expense and $34.4 million deferred income tax expense). Current income tax expense was lower in 2015 as a result of lower taxable income in Colombia. The deferred tax recovery for the year ended December 31, 2015, included $91.7 million associated with the ceiling test impairment loss in Colombia. In 2014, deferred income tax recovery associated with impairment losses in Peru was offset by a full valuation allowance\nThe following is a schedule by year of purchase obligations, future minimum payments for firm agreements and leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2015:\nHolding all factors constant other than benchmark oil prices and related royalty rates, we do not expect any downward adjustment to our consolidated NAR reserve volumes during the first quarter of 2016. This disclosure is based on a pro forma Brent oil price of $48.82 per bbl for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016, calculated as described above.\nThe two-step goodwill impairment test would require a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the net book value of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value, including goodwill, we would write down the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. The most significant judgments involved in estimating the fair values of our reporting units would relate to the valuation of our property and equipment. A lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge. Unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge. A goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources. However, it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period.\nOur 2015 capital program in Brazil included:\nThis report, and in particular this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Please see the cautionary language at the very beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the identification of and risks relating to forward-looking statements, as well as Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCapital expenditures in our Peruvian segment for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $50.4 million. Capital expenditures in 2015 included $39.4 million on Block 95 and $11.0 million on our other blocks in Peru, and consisted of drilling of $21.3 million, seismic expenditures of $5.4 million, facilities expenditures of $16.6 million and other expenditures of $7.1 million.\n \u2022 On Block REC-T-155 (100% WI, operated), we initiated construction of an infield gas pipeline between the Ti\u00ea facilities and 3-GTE-03-BA. \nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. Under this method, the net book value of properties on a country-by-country basis, less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling\u201d. The ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties, discounted at 10% per year. In calculating discounted future net revenues, oil and natural gas prices are determined using the average price during the 12 months period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the balance sheet, calculated as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month within such period for that oil and natural gas. That average price is then held constant, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts. Therefore, ceiling test estimates are based on historical prices discounted at 10% per year and it should not be assumed that estimates of future net revenues represent the fair market value of our reserves. We used an average Brent price of $54.08 per bbl for the purposes of the December 31, 2015, ceiling test calculations.\nAs noted above, actual cash flows may be materially affected by other factors. For example, in Colombia, cash royalties are levied at lower rates in low oil price environments and foreign exchange rates can materially impact the deferred tax component of the asset base, operating costs, and the income tax calculation. In Brazil, foreign exchange rates can materially impact operating costs and the income tax calculation.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, funds flow from continuing operations decreased by 66% from $319.6 million to $108.3 million primarily due to decreased oil and natural gas sales, higher transportation, severance and equity tax expenses and cash outflow on settlement of foreign currency derivatives, partially offset by decreased operating, G&A and income tax expenses and higher realized foreign exchange gains.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nIn the year ended December 31, 2014, impairment losses in our Peru cost center related to costs incurred on Block 95, and in the year ended December 31, 2013, ceiling test impairment losses in our Brazil cost center related to lower realized prices and an increase in operating costs.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $216.2 million as a result of cash provided by operating activities of $523.6 million (including $31.1 million of cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations) and cash provided by financing activities of $3.8 million, partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $308.5 million (including $18.8 million cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations) and foreign exchange loss on cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 million.\nWe have a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. Availability under the credit facility is determined by a proven reserves-based borrowing base, and remains subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent set forth in the credit agreement. Loans under the credit agreement will mature on September 18, 2018. The initial borrowing base is $200 million and the borrowing base will be re-determined semi-annually based on reserve evaluation reports, subject to a maximum of $500 million. The borrowing base for the credit facility is supported by the present value of the petroleum reserves of two of our subsidiaries with operating branches in Colombia. The credit agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $100 million. Amounts drawn down under the facility bear interest, at our option, at the USD LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 2.00% and\nThe preparation of financial statements under GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the revenues and expenses reported and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Changes in these estimates related to judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information, and, accordingly, actual results could differ from amounts estimated.\ncurrency to U.S. dollar functional currency at each balance sheet date. This translation was the main source of the foreign exchange gains. The following table presents the change in the Colombian peso against the U.S. dollar for the three years ended December 31, 2015:\nIncome Tax Expense and Recovery\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, \"Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\". ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as long-term in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We implemented this update retrospectively in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, so that the balance sheet is presented on a comparable basis. Deferred tax liabilities and assets of $1.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, have been reclassified from current to long-term in our December 31, 2014 balance sheet. The implementation of this update did not impact our consolidated results of operations or cash flows.\nOperating netback, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and funds flow from continuing operations are non-GAAP measures which do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP. Investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to net income or loss or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nOur Reserves Committee oversees the annual review of our oil and gas reserves and related disclosures. The Board meets with management periodically to review the reserves process, results and related disclosures and appoints and meets with the independent reserves consultants to review the scope of their work, whether they have had access to sufficient information, the nature and satisfactory resolution of any material differences of opinion, and in the case of the independent reserves consultants, their independence.\n \u2022 On the Garibay Block (50% WI, non-operated) and Tiple Block (owned by two other parties), the unitization of the Jilguero Field was completed and we became a 38.5% WI owner in the newly unitized field. Together with our partners, we drilled and completed three development wells, Jilguero Sur-2, Jilguero-3 and Jilguero-4 as oil producing wells. \nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" as set out in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $97.0 million as a result of cash used in investing activities of $316.8 million (including $30.4 million cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations) and foreign exchange loss on cash and cash equivalents of $7.5 million, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $216.2 million (including $4.8 million of cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations) and cash provided by financing activities of $11.1 million.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily affected by\nWe expect to finance our 2016 capital program through cash flows from operations and cash on hand, while retaining financial flexibility to undertake further development opportunities and opportunistically pursue acquisitions.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nCash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily affected by decreased oil and natural gas sales, higher transportation, severance and equity tax expenses, cash outflow on settlement of foreign currency derivatives, partially offset by decreased operating, and G&A and income tax expenses and higher realized foreign exchange gains. The main changes in assets and liabilities from operating activities were as follows: accounts receivable decreased by $44.4 million primarily due to lower oil and gas sales; inventory increased by $1.6 million primarily due to higher inventory volumes as a result of OTA pipeline disruptions, partially offset by lower inventory costs per bbl; accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $34.5 million due to the timing of payments for drilling activity; and net taxes payable decreased by $48.3 million primarily due to lower current income taxes for 2015 in Colombia.\nBusiness Environment Outlook\nDD&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased to $185.9 million from $200.9 million in 2013. On a per BOE basis, the depletion rate decreased by 4% to $27.49 from $28.60. Increased proved reserves, were only partially offset by increased costs in the depletable base.\nOil and Gas Production and Sales Volumes, BOEPD\nAs at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". The ASU creates a single source of revenue guidance for all companies in all industries and requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. The amendments in the ASU can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date\". The ASU defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition model by one year. As a result, the guidance will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosure.\n\n(1) Sales volumes represent production NAR adjusted for inventory changes and losses.\nBecause the ceiling test calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10% discount factor, the resulting value should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties. Historical oil and gas prices for any particular 12-month period can be either higher or lower than our price forecast. Therefore, oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation, and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, equity tax expense of $3.8 million represented a Colombian tax which was calculated based on our Colombian legal entities' balance sheet equity for tax purposes at January 1, 2015. The legal obligation for each year's equity tax liability arises on January 1 of each year, therefore, we recognized the 2015 annual equity tax amount in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015, we performed a valuation of our Colombia reporting unit and passed the first step of the goodwill impairment test at each of the low, medium, and high valuation cases. Ceiling test impairment losses in our Colombian cost center of $232.4 million net of the associated deferred tax recovery of $91.7 million reduced the carrying value of the reporting unit in 2015 by $140.7 million. Additionally, forward curve oil prices as at December 31, 2015, were higher after the first two years of cash flows than those used in the ceiling test impairment calculation. This reduction in carrying value combined with increased reserves and forward curve oil prices as at December 31, 2015, resulted in no impairment of goodwill.\n3.00% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% per annum to 2.00% per annum, in each case based on the borrowing base utilization percentage. Undrawn amounts under the credit facility bear interest at 0.75% per annum, based on the average daily amount of unused commitments. A letter of credit participation fee of 0.25% per annum will accrue on the average daily amount of letter of credit exposure. Under the terms of the credit facility, we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial and operating covenants which include: the maintenance of a ratio of debt, including letters of credit, to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses (\"EBITDAX\") not to exceed 4.00 to 1.0; the maintenance of a ratio of senior secured obligations to EBITDAX not to exceed 3.00 to 1.00; and the maintenance of a ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense of at least 2.5 to 1.0. As at December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants in our credit agreement. No amounts have been drawn on this facility. This credit facility was entered into and became effective on September 18, 2015, and replaced our previous credit facility which was canceled on this date. Under the terms of the credit facility, we cannot pay any dividends to our shareholders if we are in default under the facility and, if we are not in default, we are required to obtain bank approval for dividend payments to shareholders outside of the credit facility group.\nDuring periods of OTA pipeline disruptions we have multiple transportation alternatives. Each transportation route has varying effects on realized prices and transportation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 62% of our oil and gas volumes sold in Colombia were through alternative transportation routes alternatives compared with 52% in 2014.\n \u2022 On Blocks REC-T-86, Block REC-T-117 and Block REC-T-118 (100% WI, operated)), we completed the acquisition, processing and interpretation of 3-D seismic. \nIncome Taxes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $186.5 million as a result of cash used in investing activities of $233.0 million, cash used in financing activities of $9.3 million and foreign exchange loss on cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 million, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $62.3 million.\nOil and gas production NAR for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased by 1% to 19,489 BOEPD compared with 19,283 BOEPD in 2014.\nG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, of $32.4 million decreased by 37% from $51.2 million in 2014. These decreases were mainly due to reductions in the number of our employees as part of our cost saving measures, a focus on reductions of our other G&A expenses and the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies in South America and Canada, which resulted in savings for costs denominated in local currency. Additionally, G&A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015, were net of a credit of $2.6 million relating to the reversal of stock-based compensation expense for unvested options and RSUs associated with terminated employees. These G&A expense reductions were partially offset by lower allocations to capital projects due to lower capital activity and deferred financing fees expensed as a result of the cancellation of our previous credit facility. G&A expenses per BOE in the year ended December 31, 2015, of $4.85 were 36% lower compared with $7.58 in 2014 for the same reasons, partially offset by lower sales.\nOil and gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015, decreased by 1% to 18,260 BOEPD compared with 18,523 BOEPD in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, an oil inventory increase accounted for 0.4 MMbbl, or 1,229 bopd, of reduced sales compared with an oil inventory increase in 2014 which accounted for 0.3 MMbbl, or 760 bopd, reduced sales. Oil inventory changes are primarily in Colombia.\nOther Gains and Losses\nIn Brazil, our operations in the Ti\u00ea Field were suspended by the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Petr\u00f3leo G\u00e1s Natural e Biocombust\u00edveis (\"ANP\") from March 11, 2015, to May 15, 2015, due to alleged non-compliance with certain requirements regarding the health and safety management system identified during a safety and operational audit conducted by the ANP in early 2015. Clearance to resume production was received on May 15, 2015. However, during the second half of 2015, our production in Brazil was limited by a temporary capacity reduction at a third party's shipping facility due to an integrity issue with one of their oil receiving tanks. The operator of the facility has advised that it expects to have this tank repaired and operational by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nWe carry on business in several countries and as a result, we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. The determination of our income tax provision is inherently complex and we are required to interpret continually changing regulations and make certain judgments. While income tax filings are subject to audits and reassessments, we believe we have made adequate provision for all income tax obligations. However, changes in facts and circumstances as a result of income tax audits, reassessments, jurisprudence and any new legislation may result in an increase or decrease in our provision for income taxes.\nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. An estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item. We consider the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when it is more likely than not that we will not realize the full tax benefit of the position. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The goodwill on our balance sheet resulted from the Solana Resources Limited and Argosy Energy International L.P. acquisitions, in 2008 and 2006 respectively, and relates entirely to the Colombia reporting unit.\n(1) Sales volumes represent production NAR adjusted for inventory changes and losses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, severance expenses were $9.0 million compared with nil in 2014 and 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced the number of our employees and contractors.\nWe believe that our cash resources, including cash on hand and cash generated from operations, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our strategic objectives and planned capital program for 2016, given current oil price trends and production levels. In accordance with our investment policy, cash balances are held in our primary cash management bank in interest earning current accounts or are invested in U.S. or Canadian government-backed federal, provincial or state securities or other money market instruments with high credit ratings and short-term liquidity. We believe that our current financial position provides us the flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions.\nAt each reporting date, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Changes in our future cash flows, operating results, growth rates, capital expenditures, cost of capital, discount rates, stock price or related market capitalization, could affect the results of our annual goodwill assessment and, accordingly, potentially lead to future goodwill impairment charges.\nCertain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes; and (b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. The areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made are discussed below.\nA provision for legal and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management. In many cases, management's judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and/or courts of law. Management closely monitors known and potential legal and other contingencies and periodically determines when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us.\nIf our net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, is in excess of the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written off as an expense. Any such write-down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower DD&A expenses in future periods. The ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. An expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had estimated proved reserves NAR of 38.9 MMBOE, approximately 98% oil, of which 80% were proved developed reserves. Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from our operations and cash on hand.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2014, we had income tax expense despite having loss from continuing operations, compared with an effective tax rate of 41% in 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the difference between the effective tax rate and the 35% U.S. statutory rate was primarily a result of a loss before income taxes caused by the 2014 impairment loss in Peru which was fully offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. Other factors that affected the effective tax rate in 2014 were the change in the Colombian future tax rate, a non-deductible third party royalty in Colombia, the impact of other local taxes, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments and other permanent differences.\noperated facilities in the Putumayo Basin and reduced oil inventory related to the timing of recognition of oil sales to a short-term customer in Colombia; accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $8.8 million due to the timing of payments for drilling activity; and net taxes payable increased by $84.7 million due to increased taxable income in Colombia and the reimbursement of value added tax receivable in Colombia.\n\nOur estimates of proved oil and gas reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations. Additionally, our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of production and the amount and timing of future expenditures. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data.\nOur base 2016 capital program in Brazil is $8 million and includes minimal activity to implement water injection for reservoir pressure maintenance, and to preserve current production levels.\nIt is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one of our assumptions. As a result, we are unable to provide a reasonable sensitivity analysis of the impact a change in our assumptions would have on our financial results.\n \u2022 On Blocks 107 and 133 (100% WI, operated), we continued the environmental permitting process. On Block 107, we completed the acquisition, interpretation and processing of 2-D seismic and commenced planning activities for the Osheki-1 exploration well and the refurbishment of the base camp and well location. Both of these planning activities were suspended at the end of February 2015. \nWe record ARO in our consolidated financial statements by discounting the present value of the estimated retirement obligations associated with our oil and gas wells and facilities. In arriving at amounts recorded, we make numerous assumptions and judgments with respect to the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO, estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements, inflation factors, credit-adjusted risk-free discount rates and changes in legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. Because costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. In periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, we must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized costs, including revisions thereto, are charged to expense through DD&A.\nHighlights\nThe government in Brazil requires us to register funds that enter and exit the country with its central bank. In Brazil and Colombia, all transactions must be carried out in the local currency of the country. In Colombia, we participate in a special exchange regime, which allows us to receive revenue in U.S. dollars offshore. We may also pay invoices denominated in U.S. dollars for our Colombian business from these U.S. dollars received offshore. In Peru, expenditures may be paid in local currency or U.S. dollars.\n\nOur revenues are significantly affected by the continuing fluctuations in oil prices and pipeline disruptions in Colombia. Oil prices are volatile and unpredictable and are influenced by concerns about the quantity of world supply and demand, market competition between large suppliers to the market for market share, political influences, financial markets and the impact of the worldwide economy on oil supply and demand growth.\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10, as described in Note 2 to our annual consolidated financial statements. Under the full cost method of accounting, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of properties are capitalized, including internal costs directly attributable to these activities. The sum of net capitalized costs, including estimated asset retirement obligations (\"ARO\"), and estimated future development costs to be incurred in developing proved reserves are depleted using the unit-of-production method.\nCompanies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation. The ceiling test limits pooled costs to the aggregate of the discounted estimated after-tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties, plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects.", "item_7_text": "Oil and gas sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased to $559.4 million from $647.0 million in 2013 as a result of the combined effect of decreased sales and realized prices. Average realized prices decreased by 10% to $82.74 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2014, from $92.13 per BOE for 2013. Average Brent oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $99.02 per bbl compared with $108.64 per bbl in 2013. WTI oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $93.00 per bbl compared with $97.97 per bbl in 2013. Additionally, beginning July 1, 2014, the port operations fee component of the OTA pipeline pricing structure increased by $2.94 per bbl resulting in a reduction of realized oil prices by this amount on sales delivered through the OTA pipeline. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 52% of our oil and gas volumes sold in Colombia were through alternative transportation routes alternatives compared with 64% in 2013.\n\n \u2022 We also continued facilities work at the Costayaco and Moqueta Fields on the Chaza Block, and on the Garibay Block.  Outlook - Colombia\nCapital Program - Peru\nOverview\nContractual Obligations\nG&A Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $89.8 million, or $13.28 per BOE, compared with $91.2 million, or $12.99 per BOE, in 2013. Operating expenses per BOE increased in 2014 primarily due to increased workover expenses.\nIt is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairment losses given the many factors impacting the asset base and the cash flows used in the prescribed U.S. GAAP ceiling test calculation. These factors include, but are not limited to, future commodity pricing, royalty rates in different pricing environments, operating costs and negotiated savings, foreign exchange rates, capital expenditures timing and negotiated savings, production and its impact on depletion and cost base, upward or downward reserve revisions as a result of ongoing exploration and development activity, and tax attributes. Subject to these factors and inherent limitations, we believe that ceiling test impairment losses in the first quarter of 2016 could exceed $8 million in Brazil and $131 million in Colombia. The calculation of the impact of lower commodity prices on our estimated ceiling test calculation was prepared based on the presumption that all other inputs and assumptions are held constant with the exception of benchmark oil prices. Therefore, this calculation strictly isolates the impact of commodity prices on the prescribed GAAP ceiling test. This calculation was based on pro forma Brent oil price of $48.82 per bbl for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. These pro forma oil prices were calculated using a 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of oil prices, and included the oil prices on the first day of the month for the nine months ended December 2015, and, for the three months ended March 2016, estimated oil prices using the forward price curve forecast for the first quarter of 2015 of our independent reserves evaluator dated January 1, 2016.\n(2) Operating netback as presented is oil and gas sales net of royalties and operating and transportation expenses. Management believes that netback is a useful supplemental measure for management and investors to analyze operating performance and provide an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of other income and expenses.\nDuring early 2015, largely as a result of the low commodity price environment and drilling results in Peru, we ceased all development expenditures in the Breta\u00f1a Field on Block 95 in Peru other than what was necessary to maintain tangible asset integrity and security. As a result, all probable and possible reserves associated with the field were reclassified as contingent resources.\nOur effective tax rate was 27% for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we had income tax expense despite having losses from continuing operations. In 2014, our loss before income taxes was primarily due to impairment losses in Peru which were fully offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014 was primarily due to a smaller increase in the valuation allowance as a result of lower impairment losses in Peru where there is a full valuation allowance and an increase in foreign currency translation adjustments. Additionally, our income tax expense in 2014 reflected the impact of future income tax rate changes in Colombia on our deferred tax liability. In 2014, tax legislation was enacted in Colombia which increased the 2015 to 2018 tax rates resulting in an increase of the Colombian deferred tax liability of approximately $31.0 million.\nFunds Flow From Continuing Operations\nAllocation of Consideration Transferred in Business Combinations\nIn Peru, the 2016 capital program includes only those activities required for retention of lands and security of assets. In Brazil, the capital program includes minimal activity to implement water injection for reservoir pressure maintenance, and to preserve current production levels. In both Peru and Brazil, operations have been scaled back significantly, with the aim of allowing time to explore and execute on options to maximize shareholder value.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, \"Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\". ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows or disclosure.\nFor over 40 years, the Colombian government has been engaged in a conflict with two main Marxist guerrilla groups: the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\"FARC\") and the National Liberation Army (\"ELN\"). Both of these groups have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States and the European Union. Another threat comes from criminal gangs formed from the former members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia militia, a paramilitary group that originally sprouted up to combat FARC and ELN, which the Colombian government successfully dissolved. We operate principally in the Putumayo Basin in Colombia. Pipelines have been primary targets because such pipelines cannot be adequately secured due to the sheer length of such pipelines and the remoteness of the areas in which the pipelines are laid. The CENIT S.A-operated Trans-Andean oil pipeline (the \"OTA pipeline\u201d) which transports oil from the Putumayo region and which is one of our export routes, has been targeted by these guerrilla groups. In 2015, the OTA pipeline was shutdown for approximately 213 days, which included 117 days as a result of a landslide.\nGoodwill\nIn addition to our 2016 base capital budget, we have a discretionary capital budget of $61 million that we may utilize during 2016 in the event of an increase in commodity prices. If deployed, we expect that our discretionary capital budget would target six exploration wells, five development wells and seismic activities in Colombia.\nCash Flows\nOther gains and losses in the three years ended December 31, 2015, related to a contingent loss accrued in connection with a legal dispute. In 2013, we received an adverse legal judgment and the amount awarded in the legal judgment was denominated in bbl of oil. We filed an appeal against the judgment. Other gains in the year ended December 31, 2014, related to a reduction in the value of this contingent loss due to lower oil prices. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we received an adverse legal judgment from the appeal court. We paid $1.9 million, the amount awarded by the appeal court, during the fourth quarter of 2015 and a gain was recognized as a result of a reduction in the in the value of the previously recognized contingent loss.\nWith the exception of net income and loss from discontinued operations, the 2014 and 2013 amounts in the table above exclude amounts relating to discontinued operations. Oil and gas production NAR associated with discontinued operations was nil BOEPD for the year ended December 31, 2015 (2014 - 1,361 BOEPD; 2013 - 3,028 BOEPD). Argentina production for the year ended December 31, 2014, was calculated to the date of sale of June 25, 2014.\nDD&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, decreased to $176.4 million from $185.9 million in 2014. On a per BOE basis, the depletion rate decreased by 4% to $26.47 from $27.49. On a per BOE basis, the decrease was due to lower costs in the depletable base and increased proved reserves at year end.\nOur base 2016 capital program in Colombia is $76 million and includes two water injector wells in the Costayaco Field and three development wells in the Moqueta Field, both on the Chaza Block (100% WI, operated), two exploration wells and a development well in the Putumayo-7 Block (subject to regulatory approval, 100% WI, operated) and an exploration well in the Llanos-10 Block (50% WI, non-operated). The Llanos-10 exploration well is being drilled by an industry partner and our share of the cost is expected to be less than $0.5 million. Facilities work is also planned for the Chaza Block.\n \u2022 On the Chaza Block (100% working interest (\"WI\"), operated), we drilled and completed the Costayaco-25D and Costayaco-26D development wells in the Costayaco Field, and the Moqueta-17 and Moqueta-21D development wells in the Moqueta Field, as oil producers. The Moqueta-19i well was completed as a water injector as planned. We commenced drilling the Costayaco-24D and Costayaco-27i development well and started pre-drilling activities for the Moqueta-20, 22 and 23 development wells. We also drilled the Moqueta-18i development well and encountered mechanical difficulties. The well is currently suspended. \nOn January 13, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Petroamerica Oil Corp (\"Petroamerica\") for cash consideration of $70.6 million and the issuance of 13,656,719 shares of Gran Tierra common stock with a value of $25.8 million. On January 25, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of PetroGranada Colombia Limited (\"PGC\") for a net purchase price of $19.0 million, after giving consideration to estimated net working capital of $18.7 million. In addition, we agreed to pay contingent consideration of $4.0 million if cumulative production from the Putumayo-7 Block plus gross proved plus probable reserves under the Putumayo-7 Block meet or exceed 8 MMbbl. Combined proved NAR oil and gas reserves of Petroamerica and PGC as at December 31, 2015, were 3.9 MMBOE.\nAt December 31, 2015, 92% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by subsidiaries and partnerships outside of Canada and the United States. This cash was generally not available to fund domestic or head office operations unless funds were repatriated. At this time, we do not intend to repatriate further funds, but if we did, we might have to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain jurisdictions on the distribution of accumulated earnings. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested and a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.\n(5) In 2013, capital expenditures are net of proceeds of $54.0 million relating to termination of a farm-in agreement in Brazil; and $1.5 million relating to the sale of our working interest of a block in Colombia.\n\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\". The ASU provides guidance for the subsequent measurement of inventory and requires that inventory that is measured using average cost be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The ASU will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The implementation of this update is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows or disclosure.\nCapital Program - Colombia\nConsolidated Results of Continuing Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015, Compared with the Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nIn January 2016, we announced our 2016 capital budget. Our base 2016 capital program of $107 million consists of: $76 million for Colombia; $8 million for Brazil; $6 million for Peru; and $17 million for other.\nOil prices are volatile and unpredictable and influenced by concerns over world supply and demand imbalance and many other market factors outside of our control. Oil prices started falling in July 2014 and fell dramatically during the period December 2014 to March 2015. Prices have remained low and volatile. During 2015, the average price realized for our oil was $41.56 per bbl (2014 - $83.22; 2013 - $92.31). Average Brent oil price for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $52.35 per bbl compared with $99.02 per bbl in 2014 and $108.64 in 2013. Average West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") oil price for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $48.78 per bbl compared with $93.00 per bbl in 2014 and $97.97 in 2013.\nWe assessed our oil and gas properties for impairment as at December 31, 2015, and recorded ceiling test impairment losses of $232.4 million in our Colombia cost center, and $46.9 million in our Brazil cost center, related to lower oil prices. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we also recorded impairment losses in our Peru cost center of $41.9 million, related to costs incurred on Block 95. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an impairment loss of unproved properties in our Peru cost center of $265.1 million due to the lack of continued investment planned for Block 95. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a ceiling test impairment loss of $2.0 million in our Brazil cost center as a result of lower realized prices and increased operating costs.\nDD&A Expenses\nOur base 2016 capital program in Peru is $6 million and includes only those activities required for retention of lands and security of assets.\nThe credit markets, including the high yield bond market and other debt markets that provide capital to oil and gas companies have experienced adverse conditions. We have not been materially impacted by these conditions; however, continuing volatility in oil prices may continue to contribute to these adverse conditions, which could increase costs associated with renewing or issuing debt or affect our ability to access those markets.\nOutlook - Peru\n\n\n(3) EBITDA, as presented, is net income or loss adjusted for loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, depletion, depreciation and accretion ( DD&A\u201d) expenses, asset impairment and income tax recovery or expense. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for foreign exchange gains. Management uses these financial measures to analyze performance and income or loss generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of how non-cash items affect that income or loss, and believes that these financial measures are also useful supplemental information for investors to analyze performance and our financial results. A reconciliation from net income or loss to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nAt December 31, 2015, we had provided promissory notes totaling $76.5 million as security for letters of credit relating to work commitment guarantees contained in exploration contracts and other capital or operating requirements.\nHolding all factors constant other than benchmark oil prices, it is reasonably likely that we will experience ceiling test impairment losses in our Brazil and Colombia cost centers in the first quarter of 2016. The calculation excludes the effect of our acquisitions of Petroamerica and PGC which closed subsequent to year end.\n\nThe above table does not reflect estimated amounts expected to be incurred in the future associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties and other long-term liabilities, as we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of such payments. Information regarding our asset retirement obligation can be found in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligation, in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d,\nForeign currency derivative gains and losses related to our Colombian peso non-deliverable forward contracts. We purchased these contracts for purposes of fixing the exchange rate at which we would purchase or sell Colombian pesos to settle our income tax installments and payments. At December 30, 2015, we did not have any open foreign currency derivative positions.\n2016 Capital Program\nAs previously discussed, all probable and possible reserves associated with the Breta\u00f1a Field on Block 95 in Peru were reclassified as contingent resources in a report with an effective date of January 31, 2015. These reserves are excluded from the table above. Estimated proved, probable and possible oil and gas reserves, NAR, as at December 31, 2013, included 4.4, 2.1 and 10.3 MMBOE, respectively, in Argentina.\nIn 2015 in Colombia, production from new wells in the Moqueta Field in the Chaza Block and increased production from the Jilguero Field in the Garibay Block, as a result of the unitization of that field and new wells coming on stream, was offset by the impact of normal field production declines in the Costayaco Field in the Chaza Block and the Juanambu Field in the Guayuyaco Block. Production during the year ended December 31, 2015, reflected approximately 213 days of OTA pipeline disruptions in Colombia compared with 180 days in 2014. Despite the OTA pipeline being down for 213 days we did not have to shut in any production in 2015 due to the different routes available to transport our crude oil.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Guidry replaced Duncan Nightingale in that role, who was serving as interim Chief Executive Officer since February 2015 and, with the appointment of Mr. Guidry as Chief Executive Officer, was designated as Executive Vice President until February 19, 2016, when he ceased performing this role. Additionally, effective May 11, 2015, Ryan Ellson was appointed as Chief Financial Officer. In connection with our entry into the Agreement, the size of our Board of Directors was expanded, new directors were appointed to fill the newly created vacancies and certain existing directors agreed not to stand for re-election at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders. In June 2015, our Board of Directors approved a new capital program focusing on development activities in Colombia.\n(1) Operating netback is a non-GAAP measure which does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP. Refer to non-GAAP measures disclosure above regarding this measure.\nCapital expenditures in our Colombian segment during the year ended December 31, 2015, were $87.7 million, including drilling of $60.5 million, facilities of $13.6 million, seismic expenditures of $6.2 million and $7.4 million of other expenditures.\nNon-GAAP measures\n\nWe are required to remove or remedy the effect of our activities on the environment at our present and former operating sites by dismantling and removing production facilities and remediating any damage caused. Estimating our future ARO requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to activities that will occur many years into the future. In addition, the ultimate financial impact of environmental laws and regulations is not always clearly known and cannot be reasonably estimated as standards evolve in the countries in which we operate.\nAs is customary in the oil and gas industry, we may at times have commitments in place to reserve or earn certain acreage positions or wells. If we do not meet such commitments, the acreage positions or wells may be lost and associated penalties may be payable.\nTransportation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $40.2 million, or $6.03 per BOE, compared with $24.2 million, or $3.58 per BOE, in 2014. On a per BOE basis, transportation expenses increased by 68%. The increase in transportation expenses per BOE was primarily due to the alternative transportation routes used during periods of OTA pipeline disruptions. During 2015, we used new alternative transportation routes which carried higher transportation costs, but higher realized prices compared with other customers.\nTrading securities losses related to unrealized losses on the Madalena Energy Inc. (\"Madalena\") shares we received in connection with the sale of our Argentina business unit in June 2014.\nCapital Program - Brazil\nWhile peace talks continue between the Colombian government and the FARC, peace process negotiations between the government and FARC may not generate the intended outcome for both parties, though the Colombian government has stated that a resolution is expected to be reached during the first quarter of 2016. The impact of such a peace process is not determinable on our operations. Continuing attempts by the Colombian government to reduce or prevent guerrilla activity may not be successful and guerrilla activity may continue to disrupt our operations in the future. Our efforts to increase security measures may not be successful and there can also be no assurance that we can maintain the safety of our or our contractors' field personnel and Bogota head office personnel or operations in Colombia or that this violence will not continue to adversely affect our operations in the future and cause significant loss.\nAsset Impairment\nOur future growth and acquisitions may depend on our ability to raise additional funds through equity and debt markets. Should we be required to raise debt or equity financing to fund capital expenditures or other acquisition and development opportunities, such funding may be affected by the market value of shares of our Common Stock. The current low and volatile oil price has had a negative impact on the value of shares of our Common Stock. Also, raising funds by issuing shares or other equity securities would further dilute our existing shareholders, and this dilution would be exacerbated by a decline in our share price. Any securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to our existing equity securities. Borrowing money may also involve further pledging of some or all of our assets, may require compliance with debt covenants and will expose us to interest rate risk. Depending on the currency used to borrow money, we may also be exposed to further foreign exchange risk. Our ability to borrow money and the interest rate we pay for any money we borrow will be affected by market conditions and we cannot predict what price we may pay for any borrowed money.\ndecreased oil and natural gas sales, increased transportation and G&A expenses and lower realized foreign exchange gain, partially offset by decreased operating and income tax expenses and cash inflows on settlement of foreign currency derivatives. The main changes in assets and liabilities from operating activities were as follows: accounts receivable increased by $34.5 million primarily due to an increase in the number of days of sales outstanding in Colombia as a result of a higher portion of sales being to Ecopetrol which has longer payment terms than our other significant customers; inventory increased by $2.9 million primarily due to the timing of recognition of oil sales to a customer in Colombia where the sale is not recognized until the customer exports oil; accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $0.6 million due to the timing of payments for drilling activity and higher accruals for trucking costs; and net taxes payable decreased by $61.1 million primarily due to payment of 2013 income taxes in Colombia and lower current income taxes for 2014 in Colombia.\nFull Cost Method of Accounting, Proved Reserves, DD&A and Impairments of Oil and Gas Properties\nOn May 7, 2015, we entered into an agreement (the Agreement\u201d) with West Face SPV (Cayman) I L.P. ( West Face\u201d) pursuant to which we settled a proxy contest. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Gary Guidry was appointed as our\nSeverance Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, funds flow from continuing operations decreased by 8% from $348.0 million to $319.6 million primarily due to decreased oil and natural gas sales, increased transportation and G&A expenses and lower realized foreign exchange gains, partially offset by decreased operating and income tax expenses and cash inflows on settlement of foreign currency derivatives.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCash outflows from investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, included capital expenditures of $156.6 million and $76.8 million of net cash outflows related to changes in assets and liabilities associated with investing activities, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $0.5 million. Cash outflows from investing activities of continuing operations in the year ended year ended December 31, 2014, included capital expenditures of $391.5 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.1 million, partially offset by $44.5 million of net cash inflows related to changes in assets and liabilities associated with investing activities. Cash outflows from investing activities of continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2013, included capital expenditures of $345.9 million, and an increase in restricted cash of $1.6 million, partially offset by $2.3 million of net cash inflows related to changes in assets and liabilities associated with investing activities and proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties of $55.5 million.\nThe variance from the 35% U.S. statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance, a non-deductible third party royalty in Colombia, the impact of local taxes, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by other permanent differences, foreign currency translation adjustments and the foreign tax rate differential.\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $75.6 million, or $11.34 per BOE, compared with $89.8 million, or $13.28 per BOE in 2014. On a per BOE basis, operating expenses decreased by 15%. The decrease in operating expenses per BOE in 2015 was primarily due to Colombian operating cost savings and the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies in South America. In Brazil, in the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $1.7 million, or $8.98 per bbl based on volumes sold in Brazil, of one-time penalties relating to alleged non-compliance with certain requirements regarding the health and safety management system, identified during a safety and operational audit conducted by the ANP in early 2015.\nOutlook - Brazil\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, \"Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\". ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Prospective adoption is required. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows or disclosure.\nWe believe our assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time we prepare our estimates. However, these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWhile these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources, they can have an effect on the future results of operations. Generally, the higher the fair value assigned to both oil and gas properties and non-oil and gas properties, the lower future net income will be as a result of higher future DD&A expenses. Also, a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties, based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices, will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling write down in the event that future oil and gas prices drop below the price forecast used to originally determine fair value.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily affected by increased oil and natural gas sales, decreased G&A expenses, decreased realized foreign exchange losses and a $146.6 million change in assets and liabilities from operating activities. These increases were partially offset by increased operating and income tax expenses. The main changes in assets and liabilities from operating activities were as follows: accounts receivable and other long-term assets decreased by $59.0 million primarily due to a reduction in the number of days of sales outstanding in Colombia which resulted from a larger portion of sales in 2013 being to a customer with more favorable payment terms; inventory decreased by $14.2 million primarily due to the reduced oil inventory in the OTA pipeline and associated Ecopetrol\n(4) Funds flow from continuing operations, as presented, is net income or loss adjusted for loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, DD&A expenses, asset impairment, deferred tax recovery or expense, non-cash stock-based compensation, financial instrument loss, unrealized foreign exchange gains, cash settlement of foreign currency derivatives, other gains and losses and equity tax. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our new management changed our method of calculating funds flow from continuing operations to be more consistent with our peers. Funds flow from continuing operations is no longer net of cash settlement of asset retirement obligation. Additionally, foreign exchange losses on cash and cash equivalents have been excluded from funds flow. Comparative information has been reclassified to be calculated on a consistent basis. Management uses this financial measure to analyze performance and income or loss generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of how non-cash items affect that income or loss, and believes that this financial measure is also useful supplemental information for investors to analyze performance and our financial results. A reconciliation from net income or loss to funds flow from continuing operations is as follows:\nCapital expenditures in our Brazilian segment during the year ended December 31, 2015, were $20.0 million, including drilling of $0.8 million, facilities of $5.6 million, seismic of $10.1 million and $3.5 million of other expenditures.\nThe significant elements of our 2015 capital program in Colombia were:\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOperating Netbacks\nWhile the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the associated prices of oil and natural gas and the applicable discount rate, that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that a 10% discount factor be used and future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent the average of the first day of each month price for the 12-month period. Therefore, the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs, but reflect adjustments for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market. Estimates of standardized measure of our future cash flows from proved reserves for our December 31, 2015, ceiling tests were based on wellhead prices per BOE as of the first day of each month within that twelve month period of $43.51 for Colombia and $37.72 for Brazil.\nCash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the repurchase of shares of our Common Stock pursuant to a normal course issuer bid, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of stock options Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 related to proceeds from issuance of shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of stock options.\nOil and gas sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, decreased to $276.0 million from $559.4 million in 2014 primarily as a result of the effect of decreased realized prices. Average realized prices decreased by 50% to $41.41 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $82.74 per BOE for 2014 primarily due to lower benchmark oil prices. Average Brent oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $52.35 per bbl compared with $99.02 per bbl in 2014. WTI oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $48.78 per bbl compared with $93.00 per bbl in 2014.\nOn a regular basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nFinancial Instrument Gains and Losses\nOil and gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased by 4% to 18,523 BOEPD compared with 19,239 BOEPD in 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, an oil inventory increase in 2014 accounted for 0.3 MMbbl, or 760 bopd, of reduced sales compared with an oil inventory decrease in 2013 which accounted for 0.1 MMbbl, or 168 bopd, of increased sales.\nWe believe that our current operations and 2016 capital expenditure program can be funded from cash flow from existing operations and cash on hand. Should our operating cash flow decline due to unforeseen events, including additional pipeline delivery restrictions in Colombia or continued downturn in oil and gas prices, we would consider financing our capital expenditure program with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or capital markets transactions, or a combination thereof, or we would consider reducing our capital expenditure program. Given the current economic environment and unstable conditions in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe and the current over supply of oil in world markets, the oil price environment is unpredictable and unstable. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, these events may have on oil prices and demand. The timing and execution of our capital expenditure program are also affected by the availability of services from third party oil field contractors and our ability to obtain, sustain or renew necessary government licenses and permits on a timely basis to conduct exploration and development activities. Any delay may affect our ability to execute our capital expenditure program.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 On Block 95 (100% WI, operated), we completed drilling operations in the Breta\u00f1a Sur 95-3-4-1X appraisal well on the L4 lobe in the Breta\u00f1a Field, which satisfied our work obligation for the fifth exploration period. We encountered approximately six feet of oil pay above the oil-water contact in the Vivian Sandstone Reservoir. This oil column was less than what we had estimated prior to drilling. As previously discussed, in February 2015, we ceased all further development expenditures in the Breta\u00f1a Field on Block 95 other than what is necessary to maintain tangible asset integrity and security. Prior to the decision to cease further development expenditures in the Breta\u00f1a Field, we continued construction of the long-term test facilities, continued the FEED study for full field development and completed a workover on the water disposal well Breta\u00f1a Norte 95-2-1XD ST on this field. \nOn June 25, 2014, we sold our Argentina business unit to Madalena for aggregate consideration of $69.3 million, comprising $55.4 million in cash and $13.9 million in Madalena shares. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we met the criteria to classify our Argentina business unit as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2014. As such, the results of operations for our Argentina business unit are reflected as loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes and discussed further in Note 3, \"Discontinued Operations,\" of our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2015.\nUnproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves. Costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined. Unproved properties are evaluated quarterly to ascertain whether impairment has occurred. Unproved properties, the costs of which are individually significant, are assessed individually by considering seismic data, plans or requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results and activity, remaining time in the commitment period, remaining capital plans and political, economic and market conditions. Where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant, these properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment. During any period in which factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative costs incurred to date for such property are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization. The transfer of costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on our drilling plans and results, seismic evaluations, the assignment of proved reserves, availability of capital and other factors. For countries where a reserve base has not yet been established, the impairment is charged to earnings.\nThe acquisition of properties in Brazil in 2012 was accounted for using the acquisition method, with Gran Tierra being the acquirer, whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration transferred was equal to the fair value of the net assets acquired and no gain or goodwill was recorded on acquisition. Calculation of fair values of assets and liabilities, which was done with the assistance of independent advisors, was subject to estimates which include various assumptions including the fair value of proved and unproved reserves of the assets acquired as well as future production and development costs and future oil and gas prices.\nWe utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of all of our stock options. The use of such models requires substantial judgment with respect to expected life, volatility, expected returns and other factors. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our shares. We use historical experience for exercises to determine expected life. We are responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share based payment awards.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe significant elements of our 2015 capital program in Peru were:\nIncome tax expense was $127.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $128.3 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower taxable income in Colombia and lower taxes in Brazil, partially offset by the impact of future tax rate changes on the Colombian deferred tax liability, as discussed above. In 2013 in Brazil, a net payment of $54.0 million from a third party in connection with the termination of a farm-in agreement resulted in a current tax expense of approximately $10.4 million.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n \u2022 We completed the acquisition of 2-D seismic on the Cauca-7 (100% WI, operated), Sinu-1 (60% WI, operated) and Sinu-3 (51% WI, operated) Blocks and continued activities in preparation for the acquisition of 2-D seismic on the Putumayo-10 Block (100% WI, operated). We also commenced environmental impact assessments (\"EIA\"s) for future drilling on the Sinu-3 Block. \nWe are an independent international energy company incorporated in the United States and engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration, development and production. Our principal business activity is in Colombia and we also have business activities in Peru and Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 97% (year ended December 31, 2014 - 95%; year ended December 31, 2013 - 96%) of our revenue and other income was generated in Colombia. We are headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nWith the exception of reserves and net income, the 2014 and 2013 amounts in the table above exclude amounts relating to discontinued operations. Oil and gas production NAR associated with discontinued operations was nil BOEPD for the year ended December 31, 2015 (2014 - 1,361 BOEPD; 2013 - 3,028 BOEPD). Argentina production for the December 31, 2014, was calculated to the date of sale of June 25, 2014.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, ceiling test impairment losses in our Colombia and Brazil cost centers and inventory impairment losses were primarily due to lower oil prices. The ceiling test impairment loss in our Brazil cost center was recognized during the first three quarters of 2015. As a result of a technical evaluation of the Brazil cost center reserves completed during the fourth quarter of 2015, an upward technical revision in proved reserves resulted in no ceiling test impairment loss during that quarter. Impairment losses in our Peru cost center related to costs incurred on Block 95.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the difference between the effective tax rate of 27% and the 35% U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance, non-deductible third party royalty in Colombia and other local taxes, partially offset by the impact of foreign taxes, foreign currency translation adjustments and other permanent differences.\nG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, of $51.2 million increased by 25% from $41.1 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher salary and consulting expenses associated with increased activity for expanded operations in Peru in 2014.\nFor the years ended December, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had foreign exchange gains of $17.2 million, $39.5 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred taxes are considered a monetary liability and require translation from local\nOil and gas production NAR for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased by 1% to 19,283 BOEPD compared with 19,071 BOEPD in 2013. In 2014 in Colombia, production from new wells in the Moqueta Field in the Chaza Block and a new well in the Llanos-22 Block were partially offset by the impact of well downtime for workovers and a water cut increase in the Costayaco Field in the Chaza Block. Production during the year ended December 31, 2014, reflected approximately 180 days of OTA pipeline disruptions in Colombia compared with 229 days in 2013.\nEquity Tax Expense\nUnproved properties\nOur stock-based compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. The compensation cost is recognized net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period. GAAP requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nForeign Exchange Gains\nWe routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and establish accruals for such amounts.\nTo assess the realization of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nManagement is responsible for estimating the quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and for preparing related disclosures. Estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with SEC requirements and generally accepted industry practices in the United States as prescribed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Reserve estimates are evaluated at least annually by independent qualified reserves consultants.\nTransportation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $24.2 million, or $3.58 per BOE, compared with $18.9 million, or $2.70 per BOE, in 2013. On a per BOE basis, transportation expenses increased by 33%. The increase in transportation expenses per BOE was primarily due to higher transportation costs associated with higher sales using the OTA pipeline which carried higher transportation costs instead of the realized price reductions that we incurred with some alternative customers in 2013.\nIn Colombia, our base 2016 capital program includes two water injector wells in the Costayaco Field and three development wells in the Moqueta Field, both on the Chaza Block (100% WI, operated), two exploration wells and a development well in the Putumayo-7 Block (subject to regulatory approval, 100% WI, operated) and an exploration well on the Llanos-10 Block (50% WI, non-operated) with the costs being carried by a third party. Facilities work is also planned for the Chaza Block.\nWe follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and other types of carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $145.3 million compared with $331.8 million at December 31, 2014, and $428.8 million at December 31, 2013.\nIncome tax recovery was $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 ($15.4 million current income tax expense and $115.4 million deferred income tax recovery), compared with income tax expense of $127.2 million in 2014 ($92.9 million current income tax expense and $34.4 million deferred income tax expense). Current income tax expense was lower in 2015 as a result of lower taxable income in Colombia. The deferred tax recovery for the year ended December 31, 2015, included $91.7 million associated with the ceiling test impairment loss in Colombia. In 2014, deferred income tax recovery associated with impairment losses in Peru was offset by a full valuation allowance\nThe following is a schedule by year of purchase obligations, future minimum payments for firm agreements and leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2015:\nHolding all factors constant other than benchmark oil prices and related royalty rates, we do not expect any downward adjustment to our consolidated NAR reserve volumes during the first quarter of 2016. This disclosure is based on a pro forma Brent oil price of $48.82 per bbl for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016, calculated as described above.\nThe two-step goodwill impairment test would require a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the net book value of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value, including goodwill, we would write down the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. The most significant judgments involved in estimating the fair values of our reporting units would relate to the valuation of our property and equipment. A lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge. Unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge. A goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources. However, it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period.\nOur 2015 capital program in Brazil included:\nThis report, and in particular this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Please see the cautionary language at the very beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the identification of and risks relating to forward-looking statements, as well as Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCapital expenditures in our Peruvian segment for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $50.4 million. Capital expenditures in 2015 included $39.4 million on Block 95 and $11.0 million on our other blocks in Peru, and consisted of drilling of $21.3 million, seismic expenditures of $5.4 million, facilities expenditures of $16.6 million and other expenditures of $7.1 million.\n \u2022 On Block REC-T-155 (100% WI, operated), we initiated construction of an infield gas pipeline between the Ti\u00ea facilities and 3-GTE-03-BA. \nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. Under this method, the net book value of properties on a country-by-country basis, less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling\u201d. The ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties, discounted at 10% per year. In calculating discounted future net revenues, oil and natural gas prices are determined using the average price during the 12 months period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the balance sheet, calculated as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month within such period for that oil and natural gas. That average price is then held constant, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts. Therefore, ceiling test estimates are based on historical prices discounted at 10% per year and it should not be assumed that estimates of future net revenues represent the fair market value of our reserves. We used an average Brent price of $54.08 per bbl for the purposes of the December 31, 2015, ceiling test calculations.\nAs noted above, actual cash flows may be materially affected by other factors. For example, in Colombia, cash royalties are levied at lower rates in low oil price environments and foreign exchange rates can materially impact the deferred tax component of the asset base, operating costs, and the income tax calculation. In Brazil, foreign exchange rates can materially impact operating costs and the income tax calculation.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, funds flow from continuing operations decreased by 66% from $319.6 million to $108.3 million primarily due to decreased oil and natural gas sales, higher transportation, severance and equity tax expenses and cash outflow on settlement of foreign currency derivatives, partially offset by decreased operating, G&A and income tax expenses and higher realized foreign exchange gains.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nIn the year ended December 31, 2014, impairment losses in our Peru cost center related to costs incurred on Block 95, and in the year ended December 31, 2013, ceiling test impairment losses in our Brazil cost center related to lower realized prices and an increase in operating costs.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $216.2 million as a result of cash provided by operating activities of $523.6 million (including $31.1 million of cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations) and cash provided by financing activities of $3.8 million, partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $308.5 million (including $18.8 million cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations) and foreign exchange loss on cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 million.\nWe have a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. Availability under the credit facility is determined by a proven reserves-based borrowing base, and remains subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent set forth in the credit agreement. Loans under the credit agreement will mature on September 18, 2018. The initial borrowing base is $200 million and the borrowing base will be re-determined semi-annually based on reserve evaluation reports, subject to a maximum of $500 million. The borrowing base for the credit facility is supported by the present value of the petroleum reserves of two of our subsidiaries with operating branches in Colombia. The credit agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $100 million. Amounts drawn down under the facility bear interest, at our option, at the USD LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 2.00% and\nThe preparation of financial statements under GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the revenues and expenses reported and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Changes in these estimates related to judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information, and, accordingly, actual results could differ from amounts estimated.\ncurrency to U.S. dollar functional currency at each balance sheet date. This translation was the main source of the foreign exchange gains. The following table presents the change in the Colombian peso against the U.S. dollar for the three years ended December 31, 2015:\nIncome Tax Expense and Recovery\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, \"Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\". ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as long-term in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We implemented this update retrospectively in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, so that the balance sheet is presented on a comparable basis. Deferred tax liabilities and assets of $1.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, have been reclassified from current to long-term in our December 31, 2014 balance sheet. The implementation of this update did not impact our consolidated results of operations or cash flows.\nOperating netback, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and funds flow from continuing operations are non-GAAP measures which do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP. Investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to net income or loss or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nOur Reserves Committee oversees the annual review of our oil and gas reserves and related disclosures. The Board meets with management periodically to review the reserves process, results and related disclosures and appoints and meets with the independent reserves consultants to review the scope of their work, whether they have had access to sufficient information, the nature and satisfactory resolution of any material differences of opinion, and in the case of the independent reserves consultants, their independence.\n \u2022 On the Garibay Block (50% WI, non-operated) and Tiple Block (owned by two other parties), the unitization of the Jilguero Field was completed and we became a 38.5% WI owner in the newly unitized field. Together with our partners, we drilled and completed three development wells, Jilguero Sur-2, Jilguero-3 and Jilguero-4 as oil producing wells. \nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" as set out in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $97.0 million as a result of cash used in investing activities of $316.8 million (including $30.4 million cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations) and foreign exchange loss on cash and cash equivalents of $7.5 million, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $216.2 million (including $4.8 million of cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations) and cash provided by financing activities of $11.1 million.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily affected by\nWe expect to finance our 2016 capital program through cash flows from operations and cash on hand, while retaining financial flexibility to undertake further development opportunities and opportunistically pursue acquisitions.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nCash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily affected by decreased oil and natural gas sales, higher transportation, severance and equity tax expenses, cash outflow on settlement of foreign currency derivatives, partially offset by decreased operating, and G&A and income tax expenses and higher realized foreign exchange gains. The main changes in assets and liabilities from operating activities were as follows: accounts receivable decreased by $44.4 million primarily due to lower oil and gas sales; inventory increased by $1.6 million primarily due to higher inventory volumes as a result of OTA pipeline disruptions, partially offset by lower inventory costs per bbl; accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $34.5 million due to the timing of payments for drilling activity; and net taxes payable decreased by $48.3 million primarily due to lower current income taxes for 2015 in Colombia.\nBusiness Environment Outlook\nDD&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased to $185.9 million from $200.9 million in 2013. On a per BOE basis, the depletion rate decreased by 4% to $27.49 from $28.60. Increased proved reserves, were only partially offset by increased costs in the depletable base.\nOil and Gas Production and Sales Volumes, BOEPD\nAs at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". The ASU creates a single source of revenue guidance for all companies in all industries and requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. The amendments in the ASU can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date\". The ASU defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition model by one year. As a result, the guidance will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosure.\n\n(1) Sales volumes represent production NAR adjusted for inventory changes and losses.\nBecause the ceiling test calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10% discount factor, the resulting value should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties. Historical oil and gas prices for any particular 12-month period can be either higher or lower than our price forecast. Therefore, oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation, and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, equity tax expense of $3.8 million represented a Colombian tax which was calculated based on our Colombian legal entities' balance sheet equity for tax purposes at January 1, 2015. The legal obligation for each year's equity tax liability arises on January 1 of each year, therefore, we recognized the 2015 annual equity tax amount in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015, we performed a valuation of our Colombia reporting unit and passed the first step of the goodwill impairment test at each of the low, medium, and high valuation cases. Ceiling test impairment losses in our Colombian cost center of $232.4 million net of the associated deferred tax recovery of $91.7 million reduced the carrying value of the reporting unit in 2015 by $140.7 million. Additionally, forward curve oil prices as at December 31, 2015, were higher after the first two years of cash flows than those used in the ceiling test impairment calculation. This reduction in carrying value combined with increased reserves and forward curve oil prices as at December 31, 2015, resulted in no impairment of goodwill.\n3.00% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% per annum to 2.00% per annum, in each case based on the borrowing base utilization percentage. Undrawn amounts under the credit facility bear interest at 0.75% per annum, based on the average daily amount of unused commitments. A letter of credit participation fee of 0.25% per annum will accrue on the average daily amount of letter of credit exposure. Under the terms of the credit facility, we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial and operating covenants which include: the maintenance of a ratio of debt, including letters of credit, to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses (\"EBITDAX\") not to exceed 4.00 to 1.0; the maintenance of a ratio of senior secured obligations to EBITDAX not to exceed 3.00 to 1.00; and the maintenance of a ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense of at least 2.5 to 1.0. As at December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants in our credit agreement. No amounts have been drawn on this facility. This credit facility was entered into and became effective on September 18, 2015, and replaced our previous credit facility which was canceled on this date. Under the terms of the credit facility, we cannot pay any dividends to our shareholders if we are in default under the facility and, if we are not in default, we are required to obtain bank approval for dividend payments to shareholders outside of the credit facility group.\nDuring periods of OTA pipeline disruptions we have multiple transportation alternatives. Each transportation route has varying effects on realized prices and transportation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 62% of our oil and gas volumes sold in Colombia were through alternative transportation routes alternatives compared with 52% in 2014.\n \u2022 On Blocks REC-T-86, Block REC-T-117 and Block REC-T-118 (100% WI, operated)), we completed the acquisition, processing and interpretation of 3-D seismic. \nIncome Taxes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $186.5 million as a result of cash used in investing activities of $233.0 million, cash used in financing activities of $9.3 million and foreign exchange loss on cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 million, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $62.3 million.\nOil and gas production NAR for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased by 1% to 19,489 BOEPD compared with 19,283 BOEPD in 2014.\nG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, of $32.4 million decreased by 37% from $51.2 million in 2014. These decreases were mainly due to reductions in the number of our employees as part of our cost saving measures, a focus on reductions of our other G&A expenses and the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies in South America and Canada, which resulted in savings for costs denominated in local currency. Additionally, G&A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015, were net of a credit of $2.6 million relating to the reversal of stock-based compensation expense for unvested options and RSUs associated with terminated employees. These G&A expense reductions were partially offset by lower allocations to capital projects due to lower capital activity and deferred financing fees expensed as a result of the cancellation of our previous credit facility. G&A expenses per BOE in the year ended December 31, 2015, of $4.85 were 36% lower compared with $7.58 in 2014 for the same reasons, partially offset by lower sales.\nOil and gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015, decreased by 1% to 18,260 BOEPD compared with 18,523 BOEPD in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, an oil inventory increase accounted for 0.4 MMbbl, or 1,229 bopd, of reduced sales compared with an oil inventory increase in 2014 which accounted for 0.3 MMbbl, or 760 bopd, reduced sales. Oil inventory changes are primarily in Colombia.\nOther Gains and Losses\nIn Brazil, our operations in the Ti\u00ea Field were suspended by the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Petr\u00f3leo G\u00e1s Natural e Biocombust\u00edveis (\"ANP\") from March 11, 2015, to May 15, 2015, due to alleged non-compliance with certain requirements regarding the health and safety management system identified during a safety and operational audit conducted by the ANP in early 2015. Clearance to resume production was received on May 15, 2015. However, during the second half of 2015, our production in Brazil was limited by a temporary capacity reduction at a third party's shipping facility due to an integrity issue with one of their oil receiving tanks. The operator of the facility has advised that it expects to have this tank repaired and operational by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nWe carry on business in several countries and as a result, we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. The determination of our income tax provision is inherently complex and we are required to interpret continually changing regulations and make certain judgments. While income tax filings are subject to audits and reassessments, we believe we have made adequate provision for all income tax obligations. However, changes in facts and circumstances as a result of income tax audits, reassessments, jurisprudence and any new legislation may result in an increase or decrease in our provision for income taxes.\nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. An estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item. We consider the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when it is more likely than not that we will not realize the full tax benefit of the position. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The goodwill on our balance sheet resulted from the Solana Resources Limited and Argosy Energy International L.P. acquisitions, in 2008 and 2006 respectively, and relates entirely to the Colombia reporting unit.\n(1) Sales volumes represent production NAR adjusted for inventory changes and losses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, severance expenses were $9.0 million compared with nil in 2014 and 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced the number of our employees and contractors.\nWe believe that our cash resources, including cash on hand and cash generated from operations, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our strategic objectives and planned capital program for 2016, given current oil price trends and production levels. In accordance with our investment policy, cash balances are held in our primary cash management bank in interest earning current accounts or are invested in U.S. or Canadian government-backed federal, provincial or state securities or other money market instruments with high credit ratings and short-term liquidity. We believe that our current financial position provides us the flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions.\nAt each reporting date, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Changes in our future cash flows, operating results, growth rates, capital expenditures, cost of capital, discount rates, stock price or related market capitalization, could affect the results of our annual goodwill assessment and, accordingly, potentially lead to future goodwill impairment charges.\nCertain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes; and (b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. The areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made are discussed below.\nA provision for legal and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management. In many cases, management's judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and/or courts of law. Management closely monitors known and potential legal and other contingencies and periodically determines when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us.\nIf our net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, is in excess of the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written off as an expense. Any such write-down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower DD&A expenses in future periods. The ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. An expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had estimated proved reserves NAR of 38.9 MMBOE, approximately 98% oil, of which 80% were proved developed reserves. Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from our operations and cash on hand.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2014, we had income tax expense despite having loss from continuing operations, compared with an effective tax rate of 41% in 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the difference between the effective tax rate and the 35% U.S. statutory rate was primarily a result of a loss before income taxes caused by the 2014 impairment loss in Peru which was fully offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. Other factors that affected the effective tax rate in 2014 were the change in the Colombian future tax rate, a non-deductible third party royalty in Colombia, the impact of other local taxes, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments and other permanent differences.\noperated facilities in the Putumayo Basin and reduced oil inventory related to the timing of recognition of oil sales to a short-term customer in Colombia; accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $8.8 million due to the timing of payments for drilling activity; and net taxes payable increased by $84.7 million due to increased taxable income in Colombia and the reimbursement of value added tax receivable in Colombia.\n\nOur estimates of proved oil and gas reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations. Additionally, our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of production and the amount and timing of future expenditures. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data.\nOur base 2016 capital program in Brazil is $8 million and includes minimal activity to implement water injection for reservoir pressure maintenance, and to preserve current production levels.\nIt is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one of our assumptions. As a result, we are unable to provide a reasonable sensitivity analysis of the impact a change in our assumptions would have on our financial results.\n \u2022 On Blocks 107 and 133 (100% WI, operated), we continued the environmental permitting process. On Block 107, we completed the acquisition, interpretation and processing of 2-D seismic and commenced planning activities for the Osheki-1 exploration well and the refurbishment of the base camp and well location. Both of these planning activities were suspended at the end of February 2015. \nWe record ARO in our consolidated financial statements by discounting the present value of the estimated retirement obligations associated with our oil and gas wells and facilities. In arriving at amounts recorded, we make numerous assumptions and judgments with respect to the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO, estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements, inflation factors, credit-adjusted risk-free discount rates and changes in legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. Because costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. In periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, we must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized costs, including revisions thereto, are charged to expense through DD&A.\nHighlights\nThe government in Brazil requires us to register funds that enter and exit the country with its central bank. In Brazil and Colombia, all transactions must be carried out in the local currency of the country. In Colombia, we participate in a special exchange regime, which allows us to receive revenue in U.S. dollars offshore. We may also pay invoices denominated in U.S. dollars for our Colombian business from these U.S. dollars received offshore. In Peru, expenditures may be paid in local currency or U.S. dollars.\n\nOur revenues are significantly affected by the continuing fluctuations in oil prices and pipeline disruptions in Colombia. Oil prices are volatile and unpredictable and are influenced by concerns about the quantity of world supply and demand, market competition between large suppliers to the market for market share, political influences, financial markets and the impact of the worldwide economy on oil supply and demand growth.\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10, as described in Note 2 to our annual consolidated financial statements. Under the full cost method of accounting, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of properties are capitalized, including internal costs directly attributable to these activities. The sum of net capitalized costs, including estimated asset retirement obligations (\"ARO\"), and estimated future development costs to be incurred in developing proved reserves are depleted using the unit-of-production method.\nCompanies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation. The ceiling test limits pooled costs to the aggregate of the discounted estimated after-tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties, plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects.", "item_7_tables": "Table 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

report:\n\nOverview\n- Gran Tierra is an independent international energy company focused on oil and gas acquisition, exploration, development and production, with principal operations in Colombia.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Oil and gas sales decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013 mainly due to significantly lower oil prices. This also drove net losses in 2015 and 2014 compared to net income in 2013.\n\n- Recorded major ceiling test impairment losses in 2015 and 2014 due to the oil price decline.\n\n- Transportation expenses increased significantly in 2015 on a per BOE basis due to alternative transportation routes used during pipeline disruptions.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Cash and cash equivalents decreased significantly from 2013 to 2015. Lower oil prices negatively impacted cash flow.\n\n- Capital expenditures also decreased from 2014 to 2015 in tandem with lower oil prices.\n\n- Entered into a new credit facility effective September 2015 which replaced a prior facility. This provides a financing option if needed.\n\nOutlook\n- 2016 capital budget planned based on current oil price environment and production levels. Focused on development activities in Colombia along with minimal work in Brazil and Peru.\n\n- Additional capital expenditure budget defined which could be utilized if oil prices increase.\n\nSo in summary - lower oil prices drove lower financial results, impairment charges, lower capital spending, but the company has maintained liquidity and set 2016 plans accordingly."}
