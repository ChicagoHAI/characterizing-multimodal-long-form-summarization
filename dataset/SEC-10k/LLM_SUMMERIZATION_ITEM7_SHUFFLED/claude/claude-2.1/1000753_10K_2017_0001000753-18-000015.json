MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this annual report. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period.\nThe statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The actual results of the future events described in such forward-looking statements in this annual report could differ materially from those stated in such forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in our other public reports and filings and public statements.\nOverview\nOur long-term strategy is to provide the best small and medium-sized businesses in the United States with our specialized human resources service offering and to leverage our buying power and expertise to provide additional valuable services to clients. Our most comprehensive HR services offerings are provided through our Workforce Optimization\u00ae and Workforce SynchronizationTM solutions (together, our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions), which encompass a broad range of human resources functions, including payroll and employment administration, employee benefits, workers' compensation, government compliance, performance management and training and development services. Our overall operating results can be measured in terms of revenues, payroll costs, gross profit or operating income per worksite employee per month. We often use the average number of worksite employees paid during a period as our unit of measurement in analyzing and discussing our results of operations.\nIn addition to our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions, we offer a number of other business performance solutions, including Human Capital Management, Payroll Services, Time and Attendance, Performance Management, Organizational Planning, Recruiting Services, Employment Screening and Expense Management Services, Retirement Services and Insurance Services, many of which are offered via desktop applications and cloud-based delivery models. These other products or services are offered separately, as a bundle, or along with our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions.\nWe ended 2017 averaging 189,513 paid worksite employees in the fourth quarter, which represents a 9.8% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Approximately 23.6% and 24.5% of our average paid worksite employees were in our middle market sector for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is generally defined as companies with 150 to 2,000 worksite employees. We expect the average number of paid worksite employees per month to be between 193,500 and 195,300 in the first quarter of 2018.\nOur average gross profit per worksite employee per month was $261 in 2017 and $247 in 2016.\nOperating expenses increased 14.9% in 2017 to $442.8 million. On a per worksite employee per month basis, operating expenses increased from $194 in 2016 to $202 in 2017. Adjusted operating expenses increased 14.5% in 2017 to $440.8 million. On a per worksite employee per month basis, adjusted operating expenses increased from $193 in 2016 to $201 in 2017.\nNet income in 2017 was $84.4 million, a 27.9% increase compared to 2016. Our adjusted net income in 2017 was $103.0 million, a 34.3% increase compared to 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 25.9% over 2016 to $177.7 million.\nOur adjusted EBITDA per worksite employee per month increased 14.1% from $71 in 2016 to $81 in 2017.\nWe ended 2017 with working capital of $52.5 million. During 2017, we paid $65.8 million in dividends and repurchased shares of our common stock at a cost of $38.7 million.\nRevenues\nWe account for our revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605-45, Revenue Recognition. Our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions gross billings to clients include the payroll cost of each worksite employee at the client location and a markup computed as a percentage of each worksite employee's payroll cost. We invoice the gross billings concurrently with each periodic payroll of our worksite employees. Revenues, which exclude the payroll cost component of gross billings, and therefore, consist solely of the markup, are recognized ratably over the payroll period as worksite employees perform their service at the client worksite. This markup includes pricing components associated with our estimates of payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation costs, plus a separate component related to our HR services. We\n- 31 -\ninclude revenues that have been recognized but not invoiced in unbilled accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOur revenues are primarily dependent on the number of clients enrolled, the resulting number of worksite employees paid each period and the number of worksite employees enrolled in our benefit plans. Because our total markup is computed as a percentage of payroll cost, certain revenues are also affected by the payroll cost of worksite employees, which may fluctuate based on the composition of the worksite employee base, inflationary effects on wage levels and differences in the local economies of our markets.\nDirect Costs\nThe primary direct costs associated with revenue-generating activities for our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions are:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>employment-related taxes ( payroll taxes\u201d)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of employee benefit plans\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>workers' compensation costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Payroll taxes consist of the employer's portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, federal unemployment taxes and state unemployment taxes. Payroll taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll cost. The federal unemployment tax rates are defined by federal regulations. State unemployment tax rates are subject to claim histories and vary from state to state.\nEmployee benefits costs are comprised primarily of health insurance premiums and claims costs (including dental and pharmacy costs), but also include costs of other employee benefits such as life insurance, vision care, disability insurance, education assistance, adoption assistance, a flexible spending account program and a work-life program.\nWorkers' compensation costs include administrative and risk charges paid to the insurance carrier, and claims costs, which are driven primarily by the frequency and severity of claims.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit per worksite employee is primarily determined by our ability to accurately estimate and control direct costs and our ability to incorporate changes in these costs into the gross billings charged to PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients, which are subject to pricing arrangements that are typically renewed annually. We use gross profit per worksite employee per month as our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Salaries, wages and payroll taxes - Salaries, wages and payroll taxes are primarily a function of the number of corporate employees, their associated average pay and any additional incentive compensation.

Please read -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law. The 2017 Tax Reform Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. As a result, we remeasured our deferred tax assets at the new lower corporate income tax rate and recorded a non-cash tax charge of $2.5 million in 2017. Our provision for income taxes typically differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, due primarily to state income taxes, non-deductible expenses and various tax credits. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant items resulting in deferred income taxes include prepaid assets, accruals for workers' compensation expenses, stock-based compensation, software development costs, accrued incentive compensation and depreciation. Changes in these items are reflected in our financial statements through a deferred income tax provision. Please read Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial statements, Income Taxes,\u201d for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to health and workers' compensation insurance claims experience, client bad debts, income taxes, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, and contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical and/or require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Benefits costs - We provide group health insurance coverage to our worksite employees through a national network of carriers including United, UnitedHealthcare of California, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California, HMSA BlueCross BlueShield of Hawaii and Tufts, all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The health insurance contract with United provides the majority of our health insurance coverage. As a result of certain contractual terms, we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self-funded insurance accounting model. Accordingly, we record the costs of the United plan, including an estimate of the incurred claims, taxes and administrative fees (collectively the Plan Costs\u201d), as benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated incurred claims are based upon: (i) the level of claims processed during the quarter; (ii) estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development patterns under the plan; and (iii) the number of participants in the plan, including both active and COBRA enrollees. Each reporting period, changes in the estimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends, plan design and migration, participant demographics and other factors are incorporated into the benefits costs.\nAdditionally, since the plan's inception, under the terms of the contract, United establishes cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. If the Plan Costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums paid and owed to United, a deficit in the plan would be incurred and we would accrue a liability for the excess costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On the other hand, if the Plan Costs for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums paid\n- 33 -\nand owed to United, a surplus in the plan would be incurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The terms of the arrangement with United require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in the plan of $9.0 million, which is reported as long-term prepaid insurance. As of December 31, 2017, Plan Costs were less than the premiums paid and owed to United by $12.1 million. As this amount is in excess of the agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus maintenance level, the $3.1 million difference is included in prepaid health insurance costs, a current asset, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the premiums owed to United at December 31, 2017, were $21.9 million, which is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe believe that recent claims activity is representative of incurred and paid trends during the reporting period. The estimated completion rate and annual trend used to compute incurred but not reported claims involves a significant level of judgment. Accordingly, an increase (or decrease) in the completion rate or annual trend used to estimate the incurred claims would result in an increase (or decrease) in benefits costs and net income would decrease (or increase) accordingly.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the completion rate and annual trend on our estimate of total benefit costs of $1.5 billion in 2017:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in\nCompletion Rate and Annual Trend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nBenefits Costs\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nNet Income\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2.5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,458\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1.0)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,381\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,790\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,979\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Workers' compensation costs - Since 2007, our workers' compensation coverage has been provided through our arrangement with Chubb. The Chubb Program is fully insured in that Chubb has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities. Under the Chubb Program, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $ 1 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $5 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1 million. Our coverage from September 1, 2003 through September 30, 2007 was provided through selected member insurance companies of American International Group, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Because we bear the financial responsibility for claims up to the levels noted above, such claims, which are the primary component of our workers' compensation costs, are recorded in the period incurred. Workers' compensation insurance includes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Accordingly, the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates, which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment.\nWe utilize a third-party actuary to estimate our loss development rate, which is primarily based upon the nature of worksite employees' job responsibilities, the location of worksite employees, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers' compensation claims cost estimates. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we reduced accrued workers' compensation costs by $16.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods. Workers' compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the U.S. Treasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period (the average discount rate was 1.6% in 2017 and 1.1% in 2016) and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur claim trends could be greater than or less than our prior estimates, in which case we would revise our claims estimates and record an adjustment to workers' compensation costs in the period such determination is made. If we were to experience any significant changes in actuarial assumptions, our loss development rates could increase (or decrease), which would result in an increase (or decrease) in workers' compensation costs and a resulting decrease (or increase) in net income reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n- 34 -\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the loss development rate on our estimate of workers' compensation costs totaling $81.0 million in 2017:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Loss Development Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Workers' Compensation Costs\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nNet Income\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5.0)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,903\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2.5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,951\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,533\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt the beginning of each policy period, the workers' compensation insurance carrier establishes monthly funding requirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds\u201d). The level of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and expected workers' compensation loss rates, as determined by the insurance carrier. Monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within one year are recorded as restricted cash, a short-term asset, while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits, a long-term asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2017, we received $22.7 million for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers' compensation program, which decreased deposits. As of December 31, 2017, we had restricted cash of $41.1 million and deposits of $154.2 million. We have estimated and accrued $207.6 million in incurred workers' compensation claim costs as of December 31, 2017. Our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within one year are recorded as accrued workers' compensation costs and is included in short-term liabilities, while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year is included in long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Contingent liabilities - We accrue and disclose contingent liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with ASC 450-10, Contingencies. GAAP requires accrual of contingent liabilities that are considered probable to occur and that can be reasonably estimated. For contingent liabilities that are considered reasonably possible to occur, financial statement disclosure is required, including the range of possible loss if it can be reasonably determined. From time to time we disclose in our financial statements issues that we believe are reasonably possible to occur, although we cannot determine the range of possible loss in all cases. As issues develop, we evaluate the probability of future loss and the potential range of such losses. If such evaluation were to determine that a loss was probable and the loss could be reasonably estimated, we would be required to accrue our estimated loss, which would reduce net income in the period that such determination was made.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Deferred taxes - We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, our ability to realize our deferred tax assets could change from our current estimates. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period that such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would reduce net income in the period such determination is made. In 2017, we reduced our deferred tax assets by $2.5 million due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act. This is a provisional amount reflecting our estimate of the impact of the income tax effect of the 2017 Tax Reform Act on our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. After we finalize certain tax positions when we file our 2017 US tax return, we will be able to conclude whether any further adjustments are required to our net deferred tax asset balance of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of income tax expense in the reporting period the adjustments are made, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allowance for doubtful accounts - We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to pay their comprehensive service fees.

We generally require our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients to pay their comprehensive service fees no later than one day prior to the applicable payroll date. In addition, we generally maintain the right to terminate the CSA and associated worksite employees or to require prepayment, letters of credit or other collateral if a client's financial position deteriorates or if the client does not pay the comprehensive service fee. As a result of these efforts, losses related to client nonpayment have historically been low as a percentage of revenues. However, if our clients' financial conditions were to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in nonpayment, our accounts receivable balances could grow and we could be required to provide for additional allowances, which would decrease net income in the period that such determination was made.\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Property and equipment - Our property and equipment relate primarily to our facilities and related improvements, furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and software and capitalized software development costs. These costs are depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. If we determine that the useful lives of these assets will be shorter than we currently estimate, our depreciation and amortization expense could be accelerated, which would decrease net income in the periods of such a determination. In addition, we periodically evaluate these costs for impairment. If events or circumstances were to indicate that any of our long-lived assets might be impaired, we would assess recoverability based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the applicable asset. In addition, we may record an impairment loss, which would reduce net income, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeded the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using an estimate of discounted future net cash flows from operating activities or upon disposal of the asset.

Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which ranges from three to 10 years. Please read Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Policies,\u201d for additional information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> New Accounting Pronouncements\nWe believe that we have implemented the accounting pronouncements with a material impact on our financial statements and do not believe there are any new or pending pronouncements that will materially impact our financial position or results of operations.\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The ASU eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (formerly, Step 2) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, companies are required to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (formerly, Step 1). The guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 16, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Companies should apply this ASU on a prospective basis. We adopted ASU No. 2017-04 on January 1, 2017.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities for leases previously classified as operating leases. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently reviewing the guidance and assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU No. 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Under ASU No. 2014-09, an entity recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU No. 2014-09. We plan to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Under this method, the guidance is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. While our technical analysis is ongoing, we expect our revenue recognition policies to remain substantially unchanged as a result of adoption ASU No. 2014-09. Additionally, we do not anticipate any significant changes in our business processes or systems.\n- 36 -\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31,

During 2017, new client sales improved over 2016, client retention declined slightly compared with 2016, and the net change in existing clients also declined compared with 2016. As a result, our year-over-year growth in average worksite employees paid per month in 2017 was 10.2% compared to 13.7% in 2016.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $572.7 million in 2017, a 16.5% increase over 2016. The average gross profit per worksite employee per month was $261 in 2017 and $247 in 2016.\nOur pricing objectives attempt to achieve a level of revenue per worksite employee to match or exceed changes in primary direct costs and operating expenses. Our revenues per worksite employee per month increased 1.8% to $1,505 in 2017 versus 2016 and our direct costs, which primarily include payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation expenses, increased 1.1% to $1,244 per worksite employee per month.

Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables below.\nNon-bonus payroll cost is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of bonus payrolls paid to our worksite employees. Bonus payroll cost varies from period to period, but has no direct impact to our ultimate workers' compensation costs under the current program. As a result, our management refers to non-bonus payroll cost in analyzing, reporting and forecasting our workers' compensation costs. We include these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency related to the costs incurred under our current workers' compensation program.\nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of non-bonus payroll costs:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except per\nworksite employee per month data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll cost (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,873,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,991,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,202,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: bonus payroll cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,959,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,648,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,611,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-bonus payroll cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,914,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,342,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,590,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll cost per worksite employee (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Bonus payroll cost per worksite employee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-bonus payroll cost per worksite employee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEBITDA represents net income computed in accordance with GAAP, plus interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense.

liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of, among other things, our expansion plans, stock repurchases, potential acquisitions, debt service requirements and other operating cash\n- 47 -\nneeds. To meet short-term liquidity requirements, which are primarily the payment of direct costs and operating expenses, we rely primarily on cash from operations. Longer-term projects, large stock repurchases or significant acquisitions may be financed with debt or equity. We may seek to raise additional capital or take other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources. We had $356.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2017, of which approximately $271.5 million was payable in early January 2018 for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, and $23.6 million were client prepayments that were payable in January 2018. At December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $52.5 million compared to $39.4 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital reflects, in part, cash flow from operations, offset by share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We currently believe that our cash on hand, marketable securities, cash flows from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for 2018. We intend to rely on these same sources, as well as public and private debt or equity financing, to meet our longer-term liquidity and capital needs.\nWe have a credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. In January 2016, we borrowed $104.4 million under the credit facility, which we used to fund a portion of the purchase price for our modified Dutch auction tender offer. In February 2018, the credit facility was increased from $200 million to $350 million. The credit facility, which may be increased to $400 million based on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement related to the facility, is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit and borrowings totaling $105.4 million under the credit facility. Please read Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur net cash flows from operating activities in 2017 were $204.4 million. Our primary source of cash from operations is the comprehensive service fee and payroll funding we collect from our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients. Cash and cash equivalents, and thus our reported cash flows from operating activities, are significantly impacted by various external and internal factors, which are reflected in part by the changes in our balance sheet accounts. These include the following:\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Timing of client payments / payroll levels - We typically collect our comprehensive service fee, along with the client's payroll funding, from clients at least one day prior to the payment of worksite employee payrolls and associated payroll taxes. Therefore, the last business day of a reporting period has a substantial impact on our reporting of operating cash flows. For example, many worksite employees are paid on Fridays and at month-end; therefore, operating cash flows decrease in the reporting periods that end on a Friday. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the last business day of the reporting period ended on a Friday, client prepayments were $23.6 million and amounts payable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions was $271.5 million. In the period ended December 31, 2016, which ended on a Friday, client prepayments were $21.3 million and amounts payable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions was $221.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Workers' compensation plan funding - Under our workers' compensation insurance arrangements, we make monthly payments to the carriers comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds\u201d). These pre-determined amounts are stipulated in our agreements with the carriers and are based primarily on anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers' compensation loss rates during the policy year. Changes in payroll levels from those that were anticipated in the arrangements can result in changes in the amount of the cash payments, which will impact our reporting of operating cash flows. Our claim funds paid, based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers' compensation loss rates, were $47.5 million in 2017 and $52.7 million in 2016. However, our estimates of workers' compensation loss costs were $63.9 million and $62.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017 and 2016, we received $22.7 million and $12.8 million, respectively, for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers' compensation program, which increased working capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Medical plan funding - Our health care contract with United establishes participant cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter.

In addition, changes to the funding rates, which are determined solely by United based primarily upon recent claim history and anticipated cost trends, also have a significant impact on our operating cash flows. Since inception of the United plan, premiums paid and owed to United have exceeded Plan Costs, resulting in a $12.1 million surplus, which is $3.1 million in excess of our agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus maintenance level. The $3.1 million difference is therefore reflected as a current asset and $9.0 million is reflected as a long-term asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017. In addition, the premiums owed to United at December 31, 2017, were $21.9 million, which is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 48 -\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating results - Our net income has a significant impact on our operating cash flows.

Typically, medical claims costs tend to increase throughout the year with the fourth quarter being the period with the highest costs, which has a negative impact on our fourth quarter earnings. This trend is primarily the result of many worksite employees' medical plan deductibles being fully met by the fourth quarter, which increases our liability with respect to those claims. We have also experienced variability on a quarterly basis in medical claims costs based on the unpredictable nature of large claims. Payroll taxes and associated billings are computed based on an employee's annual taxable wage base. The annual payroll tax wage bases are frequently met in the first two quarters of each year depending on the employee's compensation levels. As a result, the gross profit contribution from payroll taxes is typically higher in the first two quarters and declines in the latter half of each year. These historical trends may change and other seasonal trends may develop in the future.

Revenues\n \u2022 Workers' compensation plan funding - Under our workers' compensation insurance arrangements, we make monthly payments to the carriers comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds\u201d). These pre-determined amounts are stipulated in our agreements with the carriers and are based primarily on anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers' compensation loss rates during the policy year. Changes in payroll levels from those that were anticipated in the arrangements can result in changes in the amount of the cash payments, which will impact our reporting of operating cash flows. Our claim funds paid, based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers' compensation loss rates, were $47.5 million in 2017 and $52.7 million in 2016. However, our estimates of workers' compensation loss costs were $63.9 million and $62.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017 and 2016, we received $22.7 million and $12.8 million, respectively, for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers' compensation program, which increased working capital. \n(1) Comprised primarily of revenues generated by our other products and services offerings\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(per worksite employee per month)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, wages and payroll taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Medical plan funding - Our health care contract with United establishes participant cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter.

funding requirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds\u201d). The level of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and expected workers' compensation loss rates, as determined by the insurance carrier. Monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within one year are recorded as restricted cash, a short-term asset, while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits, a long-term asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2017, we received $22.7 million for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers' compensation program, which decreased deposits. As of December 31, 2017, we had restricted cash of $41.1 million and deposits of $154.2 million. We have estimated and accrued $207.6 million in incurred workers' compensation claim costs as of December 31, 2017. Our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within one year are recorded as accrued workers' compensation costs and is included in short-term liabilities, while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year is included in long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

compensation increased 24.7%, but remained flat on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to awards issued under our Long-Term Incentive Program established in 2015. Stock-based compensation expense represents amortization of restricted stock and long-term incentive awards granted to employees and the annual stock grant made to non-employee directors. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 10 Incentive Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n \u2022 the periodic and recurring nature of payroll, upon which the comprehensive service fees are based \nGross Profit\n \u2022 Payroll tax costs - Payroll taxes increased 13.4%, but decreased $2 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015, due primarily to a 13.5% increase in total payroll cost in 2016. Payroll taxes as a percentage of payroll cost decreased to 6.84% in 2016 compared to 6.85% in 2015.  Operating Expenses\nTo mitigate this risk, we have established very tight credit policies. We generally require our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients to pay their comprehensive service fees no later than one day prior to the applicable payroll date. In addition, we generally maintain the right to terminate the CSA and associated worksite employees or to require prepayment, letters of credit or other collateral if a client's financial position deteriorates or if the client does not pay the comprehensive service fee. As a result of these efforts, losses related to client nonpayment have historically been low as a percentage of revenues. However, if our clients' financial conditions were to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in nonpayment, our accounts receivable balances could grow and we could be required to provide for additional allowances, which would decrease net income in the period that such determination was made.\nThe primary direct costs associated with revenue-generating activities for our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions are:\nIncome Tax Expense\n- 38 -\n\nOur net cash flows used in investing activities were $33.3 million during 2017, primarily due to property and equipment purchases.\nGross profit was $572.7 million in 2017, a 16.5% increase over 2016. The average gross profit per worksite employee per month was $261 in 2017 and $247 in 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017, and the effect they are expected to have on our liquidity and capital resources (in thousands):\nOur growth in the number of worksite employees paid is affected by three primary sources: new client sales, client retention and the net change in existing clients through worksite employee new hires and layoffs. During 2016, new client sales and client retention improved over 2015, while the net change in existing clients declined compared with 2015. As a result, our year-over-year growth in average worksite employees paid per month in 2016 was 13.7% compared to 11.6% in 2015.\n (1) Includes impairment and other charges of $10. 5 million related to the sale of two aircraft in 2015, a $2.5 million charge associated with the Employment Screening reporting unit in 2014, a $1.2 million non-cash charge related to a revision in our office consolidation plans in 2014, a $3.3 million impairment charge associated with the Expense Management reporting unit in 2013 and $2.7 million impairment charge related to The Receivables Exchange in 2013.  Following is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of adjusted diluted net income per share of common stock(1):\n \u2022 Benefits costs - We provide group health insurance coverage to our worksite employees through a national network of carriers including United, UnitedHealthcare of California, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California, HMSA BlueCross BlueShield of Hawaii and Tufts, all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts.  The health insurance contract with United provides the majority of our health insurance coverage. As a result of certain contractual terms, we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self-funded insurance accounting model. Accordingly, we record the costs of the United plan, including an estimate of the incurred claims, taxes and administrative fees (collectively the Plan Costs\u201d), as benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated incurred claims are based upon: (i) the level of claims processed during the quarter; (ii) estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development patterns under the plan; and (iii) the number of participants in the plan, including both active and COBRA enrollees. Each reporting period, changes in the estimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends, plan design and migration, participant demographics and other factors are incorporated into the benefits costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016.\n\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical and/or require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities for leases previously classified as operating leases. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently reviewing the guidance and assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 the fact that we are at risk for the payment of our direct costs and worksite employee payroll costs regardless of whether our clients pay their comprehensive service fees \n\n- 48 -\nOperating expenses increased 14.9% in 2017 to $442.8 million. On a per worksite employee per month basis, operating expenses increased from $194 in 2016 to $202 in 2017. Adjusted operating expenses increased 14.5% in 2017 to $440.8 million. On a per worksite employee per month basis, adjusted operating expenses increased from $193 in 2016 to $201 in 2017.\nNet Income\n \u2022 Contingent liabilities - We accrue and disclose contingent liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with ASC 450-10, Contingencies. GAAP requires accrual of contingent liabilities that are considered probable to occur and that can be reasonably estimated. For contingent liabilities that are considered reasonably possible to occur, financial statement disclosure is required, including the range of possible loss if it can be reasonably determined. From time to time we disclose in our financial statements issues that we believe are reasonably possible to occur, although we cannot determine the range of possible loss in all cases. As issues develop, we evaluate the probability of future loss and the potential range of such losses. If such evaluation were to determine that a loss was probable and the loss could be reasonably estimated, we would be required to accrue our estimated loss, which would reduce net income in the period that such determination was made. \nWe utilize a third-party actuary to estimate our loss development rate, which is primarily based upon the nature of worksite employees' job responsibilities, the location of worksite employees, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers' compensation claims cost estimates. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we reduced accrued workers' compensation costs by $16.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods. Workers' compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the U.S. Treasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period (the average discount rate was 1.6% in 2017 and 1.1% in 2016) and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \u2022 technology and facility repairs and maintenance costs \nor 0.11% of non-bonus payroll costs, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods, compared to $10.9 million, or 0.08% of non-bonus payroll costs, in 2016. The 2017 period costs include the impact of a 1.6% discount rate used to accrue workers' compensation loss claims, compared to a 1.1% discount rate used in the 2016 period. Please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Workers' Compensation Costs\u201d for a discussion of our accounting for workers' compensation costs.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization - Depreciation and amortization expense is primarily a function of our capital investments in corporate facilities, service centers, sales offices, technology infrastructure and that associated with our acquisitions. \nAdjusted operating expenses represent operating expenses excluding the impact of charitable contributions related to Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts in 2017, stockholder advisory expenses in 2016 and impairment and other charges related to\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.5 million or 9.2%, but remained flat on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to $1.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense related to the new facility opened on our corporate campus in early 2017. \n- 35 -\n \u2022 General and administrative expenses increased $14.6 million or 16.8%, or $2 per worksite employee per month, compared to 2016. Included in 2017 is a $2.0 million donation to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. The remaining increase was due to increased travel, meals and training on a higher level of corporate employee, event expenses associated with a new client referral program, technology maintenance costs and office costs. \nWorkers' compensation costs include administrative and risk charges paid to the insurance carrier, and claims costs, which are driven primarily by the frequency and severity of claims.\nWe periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of, among other things, our expansion plans, stock repurchases, potential acquisitions, debt service requirements and other operating cash\n \u2022 Timing of client payments / payroll levels - We typically collect our comprehensive service fee, along with the client's payroll funding, from clients at least one day prior to the payment of worksite employee payrolls and associated payroll taxes. Therefore, the last business day of a reporting period has a substantial impact on our reporting of operating cash flows. For example, many worksite employees are paid on Fridays and at month-end; therefore, operating cash flows decrease in the reporting periods that end on a Friday. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the last business day of the reporting period ended on a Friday, client prepayments were $23.6 million and amounts payable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions was $271.5 million. In the period ended December 31, 2016, which ended on a Friday, client prepayments were $21.3 million and amounts payable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions was $221.7 million. \nThe 2016 period costs include the impact of a 1.1% discount rate used to accrue workers' compensation loss claims compared to a 1.0% discount rate used in the 2015 period. Please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Workers' Compensation Costs\u201d for a discussion of our accounting for workers' compensation costs.\nOther expense, net was $1.1 million in 2016 compared to $0.1 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to interest expense incurred on borrowings under our credit facility. Please read Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt,\u201d for additional information.\n \u2022 Salaries, wages and payroll taxes of corporate and sales staff increased $29.9 million or 13.0%, or $3 per worksite employee per month, compared to 2016. The increase was due to an 8.3% rise in headcount, including an 11.7% increase in BPAs in 2017 and additional incentive compensation expense as a result of stronger operating results. \nOur adjusted EBITDA per worksite employee per month increased 14.1% from $71 in 2016 to $81 in 2017.\nDirect Costs\n- 45 -\n\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nOur revenues are primarily dependent on the number of clients enrolled, the resulting number of worksite employees paid each period and the number of worksite employees enrolled in our benefit plans. Because our total markup is computed as a percentage of payroll cost, certain revenues are also affected by the payroll cost of worksite employees, which may fluctuate based on the composition of the worksite employee base, inflationary effects on wage levels and differences in the local economies of our markets.\n (3) Please read -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of operating expenses and adjusted operating expenses:\n (2) Accrued workers' compensation claim costs include the short and long-term amounts. For more information, please read, -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Workers' Compensation Costs.\u201d \nNet income for 2017 was $84.4 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, compared to $66.0 million, or $1.54 per diluted share in 2016. On a per worksite employee per month basis, net income was $38 in 2017 compared to $33 in 2016. Please read Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Net Income Per Share, for additional information.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law. The 2017 Tax Reform Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. As a result, we remeasured our deferred tax assets at the new lower corporate income tax rate and recorded a non-cash tax charge of $2.5 million in 2017. Our provision for income taxes typically differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, due primarily to state income taxes, non-deductible expenses and various tax credits. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant items resulting in deferred income taxes include prepaid assets, accruals for workers' compensation expenses, stock-based compensation, software development costs, accrued incentive compensation and depreciation. Changes in these items are reflected in our financial statements through a deferred income tax provision. Please read Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial statements, Income Taxes,\u201d for additional information.\nOur claim trends could be greater than or less than our prior estimates, in which case we would revise our claims estimates and record an adjustment to workers' compensation costs in the period such determination is made. If we were to experience any significant changes in actuarial assumptions, our loss development rates could increase (or decrease), which would result in an increase (or decrease) in workers' compensation costs and a resulting decrease (or increase) in net income reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur revenues, which represent gross billings net of worksite employee payroll cost, increased 12.2% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to a 10.2% increase in the average number of worksite employees paid per month and a 1.8%, or $27 increase in revenues per worksite employee per month compared to 2016.\n- 47 -\nOperating expenses were $385.3 million in 2016, a 3.5% increase over 2015. We recorded a $10.5 million impairment and other charges in 2015. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 6 Impairment Charges and Other,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Operating expenses per worksite employee per month decreased to $194 in 2016 from $212 in 2015. The components of operating expenses changed as follows:\n (1) The table includes purchase obligations associated with non-cancelable contracts individually greater than $100,000 and one year. \nWe provide our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions to small and medium-sized businesses in strategically selected markets throughout the United States. By region, our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions revenue change from 2015 and distribution for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the loss development rate on our estimate of workers' compensation costs totaling $81.0 million in 2017:\n \u2022 Commissions expense increased 4.4%, but decreased $1 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015. Commissions are primarily associated with our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions. \nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\n- 40 -\n \u2022 Benefits costs - The cost of group health insurance and related employee benefits increased $4 per worksite employee per month, or 1.2%, on a per covered employee basis compared to 2016. Included in 2017 benefits costs is a reduction of $1.2 million, or $1 per worksite employee per month, for changes in estimated claims run-off related to prior periods. Included in 2016 is a charge of $5.1 million, or $3 per worksite employee per month, for changes in estimated claims run-off related to prior periods. The percentage of worksite employees covered under our health insurance plan was 68.8% in 2017 and 69.2% in 2016. Please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Benefits Costs\u201d for a discussion of our accounting for health insurance costs. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 Property and equipment - Our property and equipment relate primarily to our facilities and related improvements, furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and software and capitalized software development costs. These costs are depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. If we determine that the useful lives of these assets will be shorter than we currently estimate, our depreciation and amortization expense could be accelerated, which would decrease net income in the periods of such a determination. In addition, we periodically evaluate these costs for impairment. If events or circumstances were to indicate that any of our long-lived assets might be impaired, we would assess recoverability based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the applicable asset. In addition, we may record an impairment loss, which would reduce net income, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeded the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using an estimate of discounted future net cash flows from operating activities or upon disposal of the asset. Please read Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Policies,\u201d for additional information. \nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the completion rate and annual trend on our estimate of total benefit costs of $1.5 billion in 2017:\n \u2022 Advertising - Advertising expense primarily consists of media advertising and other business promotions in our current and anticipated sales markets, including the Insperity Invitational\u2122 presented by UnitedHealthcare\u00ae sponsorship. \n \u2022 General and administrative expenses, which includes $0.3 million and $1.5 million in stockholder advisory expenses in 2016 and 2015, respectively, increased 2.9%, but decreased $3 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015. \nOur long-term strategy is to provide the best small and medium-sized businesses in the United States with our specialized human resources service offering and to leverage our buying power and expertise to provide additional valuable services to clients. Our most comprehensive HR services offerings are provided through our Workforce Optimization\u00ae and Workforce SynchronizationTM solutions (together, our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions), which encompass a broad range of human resources functions, including payroll and employment administration, employee benefits, workers' compensation, government compliance, performance management and training and development services. Our overall operating results can be measured in terms of revenues, payroll costs, gross profit or operating income per worksite employee per month. We often use the average number of worksite employees paid during a period as our unit of measurement in analyzing and discussing our results of operations.\n- 34 -\n \u2022 employment-related taxes ( payroll taxes\u201d) \nIncome Taxes\n (2) Adjusted to reflect the two-for-one split of our common stock effected on December 18, 2017 as a stock dividend. \n \u2022 Goodwill and other intangibles - Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and is written down when impaired. Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Our purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which ranges from three to 10 years. Please read Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Policies,\u201d for additional information.  New Accounting Pronouncements\nAdditionally, since the plan's inception, under the terms of the contract, United establishes cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. If the Plan Costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums paid and owed to United, a deficit in the plan would be incurred and we would accrue a liability for the excess costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On the other hand, if the Plan Costs for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums paid\n\nOperating Expenses\nneeds. To meet short-term liquidity requirements, which are primarily the payment of direct costs and operating expenses, we rely primarily on cash from operations. Longer-term projects, large stock repurchases or significant acquisitions may be financed with debt or equity. We may seek to raise additional capital or take other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources. We had $356.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2017, of which approximately $271.5 million was payable in early January 2018 for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, and $23.6 million were client prepayments that were payable in January 2018. At December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $52.5 million compared to $39.4 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital reflects, in part, cash flow from operations, offset by share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We currently believe that our cash on hand, marketable securities, cash flows from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for 2018. We intend to rely on these same sources, as well as public and private debt or equity financing, to meet our longer-term liquidity and capital needs.\n- 36 -\n (3) Gross billings of $9,202 and $9,011 per worksite employee per month, less payroll cost of $7,697 and $7,533 per worksite employee per month, respectively.  Revenues\nOur pricing objectives attempt to achieve a level of revenue per worksite employee to match or exceed changes in primary direct costs and operating expenses. Our revenues per worksite employee per month decreased 0.7% to $1,478 in 2016 versus 2015 and our direct costs, which primarily include payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation expenses, decreased 0.6% to $1,231 per worksite employee per month. The primary direct cost components changed as follows:\nThe following table presents certain information related to our results of operations:\n- 31 -\nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of adjusted net income:\nThe following table presents certain information related to our operating expenses:\n- 37 -\n \u2022 Stock-based compensation increased $7.7 million or 46.3%, or $3 per worksite employee per month, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to awards issued under our Long-Term Incentive Program established in 2015 and the acceleration of restricted stock awards that were scheduled to vest in the first quarter of 2018 in order to maximize our tax deduction on certain restricted stock vestings, which would have been limited under the 2017 Tax Reform Act. Stock-based compensation expense represents amortization of restricted stock and long-term incentive awards granted to employees and the annual stock grant made to non-employee directors. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 10 Incentive Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 Commissions - Commissions expense consists primarily of amounts paid to sales managers and BPAs. Commissions are based on new accounts sold and a percentage of revenue generated by such personnel. \nOur pricing objectives attempt to achieve a level of revenue per worksite employee to match or exceed changes in primary direct costs and operating expenses. Our revenues per worksite employee per month increased 1.8% to $1,505 in 2017 versus 2016 and our direct costs, which primarily include payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation expenses, increased 1.1% to $1,244 per worksite employee per month. The primary direct cost components changed as follows:\nWe ended 2017 with working capital of $52.5 million. During 2017, we paid $65.8 million in dividends and repurchased shares of our common stock at a cost of $38.7 million.\nOur average gross profit per worksite employee per month was $261 in 2017 and $247 in 2016.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 10.3%, or $2 per worksite employee per month, compared to 2015, primarily due to certain acquired assets becoming fully depreciated in 2015 and the sale of our two aircraft in 2015, which eliminated the depreciation on those assets. Please read Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Impairment Charges and Other,\u201d for additional information. \nAdjusted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excludes funds associated with federal and state income tax withholdings, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, as well as client prepayments. We believe adjusted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is a useful measure of our available funds.\n (1) Adjusted to reflect the two-for-one split of our common stock effected on December 18, 2017 in the form of a stock dividend. \n____________________________________\nGross profit was $491.6 million in 2016, a 12.3% increase over 2015. The average gross profit per worksite employee per month was $247 in 2016 and $250 in 2015.\nOther income (expense) includes interest charges incurred in connection with borrowings under our credit facility and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Please read -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to health and workers' compensation insurance claims experience, client bad debts, income taxes, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, and contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe have a credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. In January 2016, we borrowed $104.4 million under the credit facility, which we used to fund a portion of the purchase price for our modified Dutch auction tender offer. In February 2018, the credit facility was increased from $200 million to $350 million. The credit facility, which may be increased to $400 million based on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement related to the facility, is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit and borrowings totaling $105.4 million under the credit facility. Please read Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt,\u201d for additional information.\n \u2022 Workers' compensation costs - Since 2007, our workers' compensation coverage has been provided through our arrangement with Chubb. The Chubb Program is fully insured in that Chubb has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities. Under the Chubb Program, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $ 1 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $5 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1 million. Our coverage from September 1, 2003 through September 30, 2007 was provided through selected member insurance companies of American International Group, Inc.  Because we bear the financial responsibility for claims up to the levels noted above, such claims, which are the primary component of our workers' compensation costs, are recorded in the period incurred. Workers' compensation insurance includes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Accordingly, the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates, which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment.\nDuring 2016 we incurred federal and state income tax expense of $39.2 million on pre-tax income of $105.2 million. Our provision for income taxes differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible expenses. In addition, during 2016, as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting, we recognized income tax benefits of $1.5 million related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercise of non-qualified stock options. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 8 Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our effective income tax rate was 37.3% in 2016 compared to 40.0% in 2015.\n \u2022 Salaries, wages and payroll taxes - Salaries, wages and payroll taxes are primarily a function of the number of corporate employees, their associated average pay and any additional incentive compensation. Our corporate employees include client services, sales and marketing, benefits, legal, finance, information technology, administrative support personnel and those associated with our other products and services. \n\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU No. 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Under ASU No. 2014-09, an entity recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU No. 2014-09. We plan to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Under this method, the guidance is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. While our technical analysis is ongoing, we expect our revenue recognition policies to remain substantially unchanged as a result of adoption ASU No. 2014-09. Additionally, we do not anticipate any significant changes in our business processes or systems.\n- 43 -\n \u2022 employee travel and training expenses \n\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this annual report. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period.\nWe believe the effects of inflation have not had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 Workers' compensation costs - Workers' compensation costs increased 2.2%, but decreased $3 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2016. As a percentage of non-bonus payroll cost, workers' compensation costs decreased to 0.54% in 2017 from 0.59% in 2016. During 2017, we recorded reductions in workers' compensation costs of $16.3 million, \n (1) Adjusted to reflect the two-for-one split of our common stock effected on December 18, 2017 as a stock dividend. \n(1) Comprised primarily of revenues generated by our other products and services offerings.\n____________________________________\nOur growth in the number of worksite employees paid is affected by three primary sources: new client sales, client retention and the net change in existing clients through worksite employee new hires and layoffs. During 2017, new client sales improved over 2016, client retention declined slightly compared with 2016, and the net change in existing clients also declined compared with 2016. As a result, our year-over-year growth in average worksite employees paid per month in 2017 was 10.2% compared to 13.7% in 2016.\nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of non-bonus payroll costs:\n \u2022 rent expenses related to our service centers and sales offices \n____________________________________\n- 33 -\n \u2022 Commissions expense increased $3.5 million or 18.1%, but remained flat on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2016. Commissions are primarily associated with compensation to our sales force for sales of our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions. \nResults of Operations\n (1) Includes non-cash impairment and other charges in the first and second quarters of 2015 of $9.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, offset by a reduction of $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Please read Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Impairment Charges and Other,\u201d for additional information. \n \u2022 workers' compensation costs  Payroll taxes consist of the employer's portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, federal unemployment taxes and state unemployment taxes. Payroll taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll cost. The federal unemployment tax rates are defined by federal regulations. State unemployment tax rates are subject to claim histories and vary from state to state.\n \u2022 Salaries, wages and payroll taxes of corporate and sales staff increased 8.8%, but decreased $5 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a 5.8% rise in headcount, including a 9.9% increase in BPAs in 2016. \n \u2022 Advertising costs increased 2.9%, but decreased $1 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015, primarily due to increased spending on Internet advertising. \n- 49 -\n \u2022 Operating results - Our net income has a significant impact on our operating cash flows. Our net income increased 27.9% to $84.4 million in 2017 from $66.0 million in 2016. Please read Results of Operations-Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016.\u201d \nOur net cash flows from operating activities in 2017 were $204.4 million. Our primary source of cash from operations is the comprehensive service fee and payroll funding we collect from our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients. Cash and cash equivalents, and thus our reported cash flows from operating activities, are significantly impacted by various external and internal factors, which are reflected in part by the changes in our balance sheet accounts. These include the following:\n \u2022 Allowance for doubtful accounts - We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to pay their comprehensive service fees. We believe that the success of our business is heavily dependent on our ability to collect these comprehensive service fees for several reasons, including: \n\nWe believe that we have implemented the accounting pronouncements with a material impact on our financial statements and do not believe there are any new or pending pronouncements that will materially impact our financial position or results of operations.\n \u2022 Deferred taxes - We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, our ability to realize our deferred tax assets could change from our current estimates. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period that such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would reduce net income in the period such determination is made. In 2017, we reduced our deferred tax assets by $2.5 million due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act. This is a provisional amount reflecting our estimate of the impact of the income tax effect of the 2017 Tax Reform Act on our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. After we finalize certain tax positions when we file our 2017 US tax return, we will be able to conclude whether any further adjustments are required to our net deferred tax asset balance of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of income tax expense in the reporting period the adjustments are made, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. \ninclude revenues that have been recognized but not invoiced in unbilled accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn addition to our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions, we offer a number of other business performance solutions, including Human Capital Management, Payroll Services, Time and Attendance, Performance Management, Organizational Planning, Recruiting Services, Employment Screening and Expense Management Services, Retirement Services and Insurance Services, many of which are offered via desktop applications and cloud-based delivery models. These other products or services are offered separately, as a bundle, or along with our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions.\nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:\nNet income in 2017 was $84.4 million, a 27.9% increase compared to 2016. Our adjusted net income in 2017 was $103.0 million, a 34.3% increase compared to 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 25.9% over 2016 to $177.7 million.\n- 44 -\nWe account for our revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605-45, Revenue Recognition. Our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions gross billings to clients include the payroll cost of each worksite employee at the client location and a markup computed as a percentage of each worksite employee's payroll cost. We invoice the gross billings concurrently with each periodic payroll of our worksite employees. Revenues, which exclude the payroll cost component of gross billings, and therefore, consist solely of the markup, are recognized ratably over the payroll period as worksite employees perform their service at the client worksite. This markup includes pricing components associated with our estimates of payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation costs, plus a separate component related to our HR services. We\nOur net cash flows used in financing activities were $102.9 million during 2017. We repurchased $38.7 million in stock and paid $65.8 million in dividends, including a special cash dividend of $41.7 million paid in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe percentage of total PEO HR Outsourcing solutions revenues in our significant markets include the following:\n \u2022 outside professional service fees related to legal, consulting and accounting services \n \u2022 administrative costs, such as postage, printing and supplies \n \u2022 Workers' compensation costs - Workers' compensation costs increased 0.6%, but decreased $5 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015. As a percentage of non-bonus payroll cost, workers' compensation costs decreased to 0.59% in 2016 from 0.68% in 2015. During 2016, as a result of closing out claims at lower than expected costs, we recorded reductions in workers' compensation costs of $10.9 million, or 0.08% of non-bonus payroll costs, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods, compared to $1.3 million, or 0.01% of non-bonus payroll costs, in 2015. \n \u2022 Benefits costs - The cost of group health insurance and related employee benefits increased $2 per worksite employee per month, or 2.0%, on a per covered employee basis compared to 2015. Included in 2016 benefits costs is a charge of $5.1 million, or $3 per worksite employee per month, for changes in estimated claims run-off related to prior periods. The percentage of worksite employees covered under our health insurance plan was 69.2% in 2016 and 70.4% in 2015. Please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Benefits Costs\u201d for a discussion of our accounting for health insurance costs. \n \u2022 the large volume and dollar amount of transactions we process \nOur gross profit per worksite employee is primarily determined by our ability to accurately estimate and control direct costs and our ability to incorporate changes in these costs into the gross billings charged to PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients, which are subject to pricing arrangements that are typically renewed annually. We use gross profit per worksite employee per month as our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level.\n \u2022 Payroll tax costs - Payroll taxes increased 12.6%, or $12 per worksite employee per month, compared to 2016, due to a 12.6% increase in total payroll cost in 2017. Payroll taxes as a percentage of payroll cost increased slightly to 6.85% in 2017 compared to 6.84% in 2016.  Operating Expenses\nOur quarterly earnings are impacted by the seasonal nature of our medical claims costs and payroll taxes. Typically, medical claims costs tend to increase throughout the year with the fourth quarter being the period with the highest costs, which has a negative impact on our fourth quarter earnings. This trend is primarily the result of many worksite employees' medical plan deductibles being fully met by the fourth quarter, which increases our liability with respect to those claims. We have also experienced variability on a quarterly basis in medical claims costs based on the unpredictable nature of large claims. Payroll taxes and associated billings are computed based on an employee's annual taxable wage base. The annual payroll tax wage bases are frequently met in the first two quarters of each year depending on the employee's compensation levels. As a result, the gross profit contribution from payroll taxes is typically higher in the first two quarters and declines in the latter half of each year. These historical trends may change and other seasonal trends may develop in the future. For further information related to our health insurance costs, please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Benefits Costs.\u201d\nEBITDA represents net income computed in accordance with GAAP, plus interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA plus non-cash impairments, stockholder advisory expenses, charitable donations related to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts and stock-based compensation, is based on the definition in our credit facility. We believe EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are often useful measures of our operating performance, as they allow for additional analysis of our operating results separate from the impact of these items, and Adjusted EBITDA is used by our lenders to assess our leverage and ability to make interest payments.\nThe following table presents certain information related to our results of operations:\n____________________________________\nRevenues\n- 32 -\n\n- 41 -\n (2) Please read -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n- 39 -\nWe ended 2017 averaging 189,513 paid worksite employees in the fourth quarter, which represents a 9.8% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Approximately 23.6% and 24.5% of our average paid worksite employees were in our middle market sector for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is generally defined as companies with 150 to 2,000 worksite employees. We expect the average number of paid worksite employees per month to be between 193,500 and 195,300 in the first quarter of 2018.\nWe believe that recent claims activity is representative of incurred and paid trends during the reporting period. The estimated completion rate and annual trend used to compute incurred but not reported claims involves a significant level of judgment. Accordingly, an increase (or decrease) in the completion rate or annual trend used to estimate the incurred claims would result in an increase (or decrease) in benefits costs and net income would decrease (or increase) accordingly.\n- 46 -\nDuring 2017 we incurred federal and state income tax expense of $45.7 million on pre-tax income of $130.1 million. Our provision for income taxes differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, non-deductible expenses, including a non-cash tax charge of $2.5 million related to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act and $6.2 million of tax benefits associated with equity compensation. Our effective income tax rate was 35.1% in 2017 compared to 37.3% in 2016.\nGross Profit\nOverview\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables below.\nNon-bonus payroll cost is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of bonus payrolls paid to our worksite employees. Bonus payroll cost varies from period to period, but has no direct impact to our ultimate workers' compensation costs under the current program. As a result, our management refers to non-bonus payroll cost in analyzing, reporting and forecasting our workers' compensation costs. We include these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency related to the costs incurred under our current workers' compensation program.\n \u2022 General and administrative expenses - Our general and administrative expenses primarily include: \nThe statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The actual results of the future events described in such forward-looking statements in this annual report could differ materially from those stated in such forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in our other public reports and filings and public statements.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 Impairment charges and other - Impairment charges and other consist of non-cash expense associated with the decline in fair value of long-lived and intangible assets, including goodwill. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 6 Impairment Charges and Other,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  Other Income (Expense)\n \u2022 costs of employee benefit plans \nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The ASU eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (formerly, Step 2) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, companies are required to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (formerly, Step 1). The guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 16, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Companies should apply this ASU on a prospective basis. We adopted ASU No. 2017-04 on January 1, 2017.\n\n____________________________________", "item_7_text": "Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nEmployee benefits costs are comprised primarily of health insurance premiums and claims costs (including dental and pharmacy costs), but also include costs of other employee benefits such as life insurance, vision care, disability insurance, education assistance, adoption assistance, a flexible spending account program and a work-life program.\nWe provide our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions to small and medium-sized businesses in strategically selected markets throughout the United States. By region, our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions revenue change from 2016 and distribution for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nthe sale of two aircraft and stockholder advisory expenses in 2015. We believe adjusted operating expenses is a useful measure of our operating costs, as it allows for additional analysis of our operating expenses separate from the impact of these items.\nOperating expenses were $442.8 million in 2017, a 14.9% increase over 2016. Operating expenses per worksite employee per month increased to $202 in 2017 from $194 in 2016. The components of operating expenses changed as follows:\nThe percentage of total PEO HR Outsourcing solutions revenues in our significant markets include the following:\nSeasonality, Inflation and Quarterly Fluctuations\nOur revenues, which represent gross billings net of worksite employee payroll cost, increased 13.0% in 2016 compared to 2015, but decreased 0.7%, or $10 on a per worksite employee per month basis compared to 2015. The revenue increase was primarily due to a 13.7% increase in the average number of worksite employees paid per month.\nand owed to United, a surplus in the plan would be incurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The terms of the arrangement with United require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in the plan of $9.0 million, which is reported as long-term prepaid insurance. As of December 31, 2017, Plan Costs were less than the premiums paid and owed to United by $12.1 million. As this amount is in excess of the agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus maintenance level, the $3.1 million difference is included in prepaid health insurance costs, a current asset, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the premiums owed to United at December 31, 2017, were $21.9 million, which is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents certain information related to our operating expenses:\nNet income for 2016 was $66.0 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared to $39.4 million, or $0.79 per diluted share in 2015. On a per worksite employee per month basis, net income was $33 in 2016 compared to $23 in 2015. Please read Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Net Income Per Share, for additional information.\n (4) Gross billings of $9,011 and $9,032 per worksite employee per month, less payroll cost of $7,533 and $7,544 per worksite employee per month, respectively.  Revenues\n \u2022 Workers' compensation plan funding - Under our workers' compensation insurance arrangements, we make monthly payments to the carriers comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds\u201d). These pre-determined amounts are stipulated in our agreements with the carriers and are based primarily on anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers' compensation loss rates during the policy year. Changes in payroll levels from those that were anticipated in the arrangements can result in changes in the amount of the cash payments, which will impact our reporting of operating cash flows. Our claim funds paid, based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers' compensation loss rates, were $47.5 million in 2017 and $52.7 million in 2016. However, our estimates of workers' compensation loss costs were $63.9 million and $62.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017 and 2016, we received $22.7 million and $12.8 million, respectively, for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers' compensation program, which increased working capital. \n(1) Comprised primarily of revenues generated by our other products and services offerings\n \u2022 Medical plan funding - Our health care contract with United establishes participant cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. Therefore, changes in the participation level of the United plan have a direct impact on our operating cash flows. In addition, changes to the funding rates, which are determined solely by United based primarily upon recent claim history and anticipated cost trends, also have a significant impact on our operating cash flows. Since inception of the United plan, premiums paid and owed to United have exceeded Plan Costs, resulting in a $12.1 million surplus, which is $3.1 million in excess of our agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus maintenance level. The $3.1 million difference is therefore reflected as a current asset and $9.0 million is reflected as a long-term asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017. In addition, the premiums owed to United at December 31, 2017, were $21.9 million, which is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nGross Profit\n- 42 -\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nAt the beginning of each policy period, the workers' compensation insurance carrier establishes monthly funding requirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds\u201d). The level of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and expected workers' compensation loss rates, as determined by the insurance carrier. Monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within one year are recorded as restricted cash, a short-term asset, while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits, a long-term asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2017, we received $22.7 million for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers' compensation program, which decreased deposits. As of December 31, 2017, we had restricted cash of $41.1 million and deposits of $154.2 million. We have estimated and accrued $207.6 million in incurred workers' compensation claim costs as of December 31, 2017. Our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within one year are recorded as accrued workers' compensation costs and is included in short-term liabilities, while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year is included in long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Tax Expense\n\n\n \u2022 Stock-based compensation - Our stock-based compensation relates to the recognition of non-cash compensation expense over the vesting period of restricted stock and long-term incentive plan awards. \n____________________________________\n\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share of common stock represent net income and diluted net income per share computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding the impact of impairment and other charges, enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act and disaster credits, stock-based compensation expenses, charitable contributions related to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, other credits and stockholder advisory expenses. Under the two-class earnings per share method, the undistributed losses resulting from dividends exceeding net income in 2014 are not allocated to participating securities. Our management believes adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share of common stock are useful measures of our operating performance, as they allow for additional analysis of our operating results separate from the impact of these items.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n____________________________________\nNet Income\n \u2022 Stock-based compensation increased 24.7%, but remained flat on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to awards issued under our Long-Term Incentive Program established in 2015. Stock-based compensation expense represents amortization of restricted stock and long-term incentive awards granted to employees and the annual stock grant made to non-employee directors. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 10 Incentive Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n \u2022 the periodic and recurring nature of payroll, upon which the comprehensive service fees are based \nGross Profit\n \u2022 Payroll tax costs - Payroll taxes increased 13.4%, but decreased $2 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015, due primarily to a 13.5% increase in total payroll cost in 2016. Payroll taxes as a percentage of payroll cost decreased to 6.84% in 2016 compared to 6.85% in 2015.  Operating Expenses\nTo mitigate this risk, we have established very tight credit policies. We generally require our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients to pay their comprehensive service fees no later than one day prior to the applicable payroll date. In addition, we generally maintain the right to terminate the CSA and associated worksite employees or to require prepayment, letters of credit or other collateral if a client's financial position deteriorates or if the client does not pay the comprehensive service fee. As a result of these efforts, losses related to client nonpayment have historically been low as a percentage of revenues. However, if our clients' financial conditions were to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in nonpayment, our accounts receivable balances could grow and we could be required to provide for additional allowances, which would decrease net income in the period that such determination was made.\nThe primary direct costs associated with revenue-generating activities for our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions are:\nIncome Tax Expense\n- 38 -\n\nOur net cash flows used in investing activities were $33.3 million during 2017, primarily due to property and equipment purchases.\nGross profit was $572.7 million in 2017, a 16.5% increase over 2016. The average gross profit per worksite employee per month was $261 in 2017 and $247 in 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017, and the effect they are expected to have on our liquidity and capital resources (in thousands):\nOur growth in the number of worksite employees paid is affected by three primary sources: new client sales, client retention and the net change in existing clients through worksite employee new hires and layoffs. During 2016, new client sales and client retention improved over 2015, while the net change in existing clients declined compared with 2015. As a result, our year-over-year growth in average worksite employees paid per month in 2016 was 13.7% compared to 11.6% in 2015.\n (1) Includes impairment and other charges of $10. 5 million related to the sale of two aircraft in 2015, a $2.5 million charge associated with the Employment Screening reporting unit in 2014, a $1.2 million non-cash charge related to a revision in our office consolidation plans in 2014, a $3.3 million impairment charge associated with the Expense Management reporting unit in 2013 and $2.7 million impairment charge related to The Receivables Exchange in 2013.  Following is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of adjusted diluted net income per share of common stock(1):\n \u2022 Benefits costs - We provide group health insurance coverage to our worksite employees through a national network of carriers including United, UnitedHealthcare of California, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California, HMSA BlueCross BlueShield of Hawaii and Tufts, all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts.  The health insurance contract with United provides the majority of our health insurance coverage. As a result of certain contractual terms, we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self-funded insurance accounting model. Accordingly, we record the costs of the United plan, including an estimate of the incurred claims, taxes and administrative fees (collectively the Plan Costs\u201d), as benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated incurred claims are based upon: (i) the level of claims processed during the quarter; (ii) estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development patterns under the plan; and (iii) the number of participants in the plan, including both active and COBRA enrollees. Each reporting period, changes in the estimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends, plan design and migration, participant demographics and other factors are incorporated into the benefits costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016.\n\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical and/or require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities for leases previously classified as operating leases. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently reviewing the guidance and assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 the fact that we are at risk for the payment of our direct costs and worksite employee payroll costs regardless of whether our clients pay their comprehensive service fees \n\n- 48 -\nOperating expenses increased 14.9% in 2017 to $442.8 million. On a per worksite employee per month basis, operating expenses increased from $194 in 2016 to $202 in 2017. Adjusted operating expenses increased 14.5% in 2017 to $440.8 million. On a per worksite employee per month basis, adjusted operating expenses increased from $193 in 2016 to $201 in 2017.\nNet Income\n \u2022 Contingent liabilities - We accrue and disclose contingent liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with ASC 450-10, Contingencies. GAAP requires accrual of contingent liabilities that are considered probable to occur and that can be reasonably estimated. For contingent liabilities that are considered reasonably possible to occur, financial statement disclosure is required, including the range of possible loss if it can be reasonably determined. From time to time we disclose in our financial statements issues that we believe are reasonably possible to occur, although we cannot determine the range of possible loss in all cases. As issues develop, we evaluate the probability of future loss and the potential range of such losses. If such evaluation were to determine that a loss was probable and the loss could be reasonably estimated, we would be required to accrue our estimated loss, which would reduce net income in the period that such determination was made. \nWe utilize a third-party actuary to estimate our loss development rate, which is primarily based upon the nature of worksite employees' job responsibilities, the location of worksite employees, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers' compensation claims cost estimates. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we reduced accrued workers' compensation costs by $16.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods. Workers' compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the U.S. Treasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period (the average discount rate was 1.6% in 2017 and 1.1% in 2016) and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \u2022 technology and facility repairs and maintenance costs \nor 0.11% of non-bonus payroll costs, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods, compared to $10.9 million, or 0.08% of non-bonus payroll costs, in 2016. The 2017 period costs include the impact of a 1.6% discount rate used to accrue workers' compensation loss claims, compared to a 1.1% discount rate used in the 2016 period. Please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Workers' Compensation Costs\u201d for a discussion of our accounting for workers' compensation costs.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization - Depreciation and amortization expense is primarily a function of our capital investments in corporate facilities, service centers, sales offices, technology infrastructure and that associated with our acquisitions. \nAdjusted operating expenses represent operating expenses excluding the impact of charitable contributions related to Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts in 2017, stockholder advisory expenses in 2016 and impairment and other charges related to\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.5 million or 9.2%, but remained flat on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to $1.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense related to the new facility opened on our corporate campus in early 2017. \n- 35 -\n \u2022 General and administrative expenses increased $14.6 million or 16.8%, or $2 per worksite employee per month, compared to 2016. Included in 2017 is a $2.0 million donation to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. The remaining increase was due to increased travel, meals and training on a higher level of corporate employee, event expenses associated with a new client referral program, technology maintenance costs and office costs. \nWorkers' compensation costs include administrative and risk charges paid to the insurance carrier, and claims costs, which are driven primarily by the frequency and severity of claims.\nWe periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of, among other things, our expansion plans, stock repurchases, potential acquisitions, debt service requirements and other operating cash\n \u2022 Timing of client payments / payroll levels - We typically collect our comprehensive service fee, along with the client's payroll funding, from clients at least one day prior to the payment of worksite employee payrolls and associated payroll taxes. Therefore, the last business day of a reporting period has a substantial impact on our reporting of operating cash flows. For example, many worksite employees are paid on Fridays and at month-end; therefore, operating cash flows decrease in the reporting periods that end on a Friday. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the last business day of the reporting period ended on a Friday, client prepayments were $23.6 million and amounts payable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions was $271.5 million. In the period ended December 31, 2016, which ended on a Friday, client prepayments were $21.3 million and amounts payable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions was $221.7 million. \nThe 2016 period costs include the impact of a 1.1% discount rate used to accrue workers' compensation loss claims compared to a 1.0% discount rate used in the 2015 period. Please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Workers' Compensation Costs\u201d for a discussion of our accounting for workers' compensation costs.\nOther expense, net was $1.1 million in 2016 compared to $0.1 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to interest expense incurred on borrowings under our credit facility. Please read Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt,\u201d for additional information.\n \u2022 Salaries, wages and payroll taxes of corporate and sales staff increased $29.9 million or 13.0%, or $3 per worksite employee per month, compared to 2016. The increase was due to an 8.3% rise in headcount, including an 11.7% increase in BPAs in 2017 and additional incentive compensation expense as a result of stronger operating results. \nOur adjusted EBITDA per worksite employee per month increased 14.1% from $71 in 2016 to $81 in 2017.\nDirect Costs\n- 45 -\n\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nOur revenues are primarily dependent on the number of clients enrolled, the resulting number of worksite employees paid each period and the number of worksite employees enrolled in our benefit plans. Because our total markup is computed as a percentage of payroll cost, certain revenues are also affected by the payroll cost of worksite employees, which may fluctuate based on the composition of the worksite employee base, inflationary effects on wage levels and differences in the local economies of our markets.\n (3) Please read -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of operating expenses and adjusted operating expenses:\n (2) Accrued workers' compensation claim costs include the short and long-term amounts. For more information, please read, -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Workers' Compensation Costs.\u201d \nNet income for 2017 was $84.4 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, compared to $66.0 million, or $1.54 per diluted share in 2016. On a per worksite employee per month basis, net income was $38 in 2017 compared to $33 in 2016. Please read Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Net Income Per Share, for additional information.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law. The 2017 Tax Reform Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. As a result, we remeasured our deferred tax assets at the new lower corporate income tax rate and recorded a non-cash tax charge of $2.5 million in 2017. Our provision for income taxes typically differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, due primarily to state income taxes, non-deductible expenses and various tax credits. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant items resulting in deferred income taxes include prepaid assets, accruals for workers' compensation expenses, stock-based compensation, software development costs, accrued incentive compensation and depreciation. Changes in these items are reflected in our financial statements through a deferred income tax provision. Please read Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial statements, Income Taxes,\u201d for additional information.\nOur claim trends could be greater than or less than our prior estimates, in which case we would revise our claims estimates and record an adjustment to workers' compensation costs in the period such determination is made. If we were to experience any significant changes in actuarial assumptions, our loss development rates could increase (or decrease), which would result in an increase (or decrease) in workers' compensation costs and a resulting decrease (or increase) in net income reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur revenues, which represent gross billings net of worksite employee payroll cost, increased 12.2% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to a 10.2% increase in the average number of worksite employees paid per month and a 1.8%, or $27 increase in revenues per worksite employee per month compared to 2016.\n- 47 -\nOperating expenses were $385.3 million in 2016, a 3.5% increase over 2015. We recorded a $10.5 million impairment and other charges in 2015. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 6 Impairment Charges and Other,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Operating expenses per worksite employee per month decreased to $194 in 2016 from $212 in 2015. The components of operating expenses changed as follows:\n (1) The table includes purchase obligations associated with non-cancelable contracts individually greater than $100,000 and one year. \nWe provide our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions to small and medium-sized businesses in strategically selected markets throughout the United States. By region, our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions revenue change from 2015 and distribution for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the loss development rate on our estimate of workers' compensation costs totaling $81.0 million in 2017:\n \u2022 Commissions expense increased 4.4%, but decreased $1 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015. Commissions are primarily associated with our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions. \nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\n- 40 -\n \u2022 Benefits costs - The cost of group health insurance and related employee benefits increased $4 per worksite employee per month, or 1.2%, on a per covered employee basis compared to 2016. Included in 2017 benefits costs is a reduction of $1.2 million, or $1 per worksite employee per month, for changes in estimated claims run-off related to prior periods. Included in 2016 is a charge of $5.1 million, or $3 per worksite employee per month, for changes in estimated claims run-off related to prior periods. The percentage of worksite employees covered under our health insurance plan was 68.8% in 2017 and 69.2% in 2016. Please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Benefits Costs\u201d for a discussion of our accounting for health insurance costs. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 Property and equipment - Our property and equipment relate primarily to our facilities and related improvements, furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and software and capitalized software development costs. These costs are depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. If we determine that the useful lives of these assets will be shorter than we currently estimate, our depreciation and amortization expense could be accelerated, which would decrease net income in the periods of such a determination. In addition, we periodically evaluate these costs for impairment. If events or circumstances were to indicate that any of our long-lived assets might be impaired, we would assess recoverability based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the applicable asset. In addition, we may record an impairment loss, which would reduce net income, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeded the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using an estimate of discounted future net cash flows from operating activities or upon disposal of the asset. Please read Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Policies,\u201d for additional information. \nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the completion rate and annual trend on our estimate of total benefit costs of $1.5 billion in 2017:\n \u2022 Advertising - Advertising expense primarily consists of media advertising and other business promotions in our current and anticipated sales markets, including the Insperity Invitational\u2122 presented by UnitedHealthcare\u00ae sponsorship. \n \u2022 General and administrative expenses, which includes $0.3 million and $1.5 million in stockholder advisory expenses in 2016 and 2015, respectively, increased 2.9%, but decreased $3 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015. \nOur long-term strategy is to provide the best small and medium-sized businesses in the United States with our specialized human resources service offering and to leverage our buying power and expertise to provide additional valuable services to clients. Our most comprehensive HR services offerings are provided through our Workforce Optimization\u00ae and Workforce SynchronizationTM solutions (together, our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions), which encompass a broad range of human resources functions, including payroll and employment administration, employee benefits, workers' compensation, government compliance, performance management and training and development services. Our overall operating results can be measured in terms of revenues, payroll costs, gross profit or operating income per worksite employee per month. We often use the average number of worksite employees paid during a period as our unit of measurement in analyzing and discussing our results of operations.\n- 34 -\n \u2022 employment-related taxes ( payroll taxes\u201d) \nIncome Taxes\n (2) Adjusted to reflect the two-for-one split of our common stock effected on December 18, 2017 as a stock dividend. \n \u2022 Goodwill and other intangibles - Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and is written down when impaired. Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Our purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which ranges from three to 10 years. Please read Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Policies,\u201d for additional information.  New Accounting Pronouncements\nAdditionally, since the plan's inception, under the terms of the contract, United establishes cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. If the Plan Costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums paid and owed to United, a deficit in the plan would be incurred and we would accrue a liability for the excess costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On the other hand, if the Plan Costs for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums paid\n\nOperating Expenses\nneeds. To meet short-term liquidity requirements, which are primarily the payment of direct costs and operating expenses, we rely primarily on cash from operations. Longer-term projects, large stock repurchases or significant acquisitions may be financed with debt or equity. We may seek to raise additional capital or take other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources. We had $356.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2017, of which approximately $271.5 million was payable in early January 2018 for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, and $23.6 million were client prepayments that were payable in January 2018. At December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $52.5 million compared to $39.4 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital reflects, in part, cash flow from operations, offset by share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We currently believe that our cash on hand, marketable securities, cash flows from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for 2018. We intend to rely on these same sources, as well as public and private debt or equity financing, to meet our longer-term liquidity and capital needs.\n- 36 -\n (3) Gross billings of $9,202 and $9,011 per worksite employee per month, less payroll cost of $7,697 and $7,533 per worksite employee per month, respectively.  Revenues\nOur pricing objectives attempt to achieve a level of revenue per worksite employee to match or exceed changes in primary direct costs and operating expenses. Our revenues per worksite employee per month decreased 0.7% to $1,478 in 2016 versus 2015 and our direct costs, which primarily include payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation expenses, decreased 0.6% to $1,231 per worksite employee per month. The primary direct cost components changed as follows:\nThe following table presents certain information related to our results of operations:\n- 31 -\nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of adjusted net income:\nThe following table presents certain information related to our operating expenses:\n- 37 -\n \u2022 Stock-based compensation increased $7.7 million or 46.3%, or $3 per worksite employee per month, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to awards issued under our Long-Term Incentive Program established in 2015 and the acceleration of restricted stock awards that were scheduled to vest in the first quarter of 2018 in order to maximize our tax deduction on certain restricted stock vestings, which would have been limited under the 2017 Tax Reform Act. Stock-based compensation expense represents amortization of restricted stock and long-term incentive awards granted to employees and the annual stock grant made to non-employee directors. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 10 Incentive Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 Commissions - Commissions expense consists primarily of amounts paid to sales managers and BPAs. Commissions are based on new accounts sold and a percentage of revenue generated by such personnel. \nOur pricing objectives attempt to achieve a level of revenue per worksite employee to match or exceed changes in primary direct costs and operating expenses. Our revenues per worksite employee per month increased 1.8% to $1,505 in 2017 versus 2016 and our direct costs, which primarily include payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation expenses, increased 1.1% to $1,244 per worksite employee per month. The primary direct cost components changed as follows:\nWe ended 2017 with working capital of $52.5 million. During 2017, we paid $65.8 million in dividends and repurchased shares of our common stock at a cost of $38.7 million.\nOur average gross profit per worksite employee per month was $261 in 2017 and $247 in 2016.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 10.3%, or $2 per worksite employee per month, compared to 2015, primarily due to certain acquired assets becoming fully depreciated in 2015 and the sale of our two aircraft in 2015, which eliminated the depreciation on those assets. Please read Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Impairment Charges and Other,\u201d for additional information. \nAdjusted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excludes funds associated with federal and state income tax withholdings, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, as well as client prepayments. We believe adjusted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is a useful measure of our available funds.\n (1) Adjusted to reflect the two-for-one split of our common stock effected on December 18, 2017 in the form of a stock dividend. \n____________________________________\nGross profit was $491.6 million in 2016, a 12.3% increase over 2015. The average gross profit per worksite employee per month was $247 in 2016 and $250 in 2015.\nOther income (expense) includes interest charges incurred in connection with borrowings under our credit facility and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Please read -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to health and workers' compensation insurance claims experience, client bad debts, income taxes, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, and contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe have a credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. In January 2016, we borrowed $104.4 million under the credit facility, which we used to fund a portion of the purchase price for our modified Dutch auction tender offer. In February 2018, the credit facility was increased from $200 million to $350 million. The credit facility, which may be increased to $400 million based on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement related to the facility, is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit and borrowings totaling $105.4 million under the credit facility. Please read Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt,\u201d for additional information.\n \u2022 Workers' compensation costs - Since 2007, our workers' compensation coverage has been provided through our arrangement with Chubb. The Chubb Program is fully insured in that Chubb has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities. Under the Chubb Program, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $ 1 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $5 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1 million. Our coverage from September 1, 2003 through September 30, 2007 was provided through selected member insurance companies of American International Group, Inc.  Because we bear the financial responsibility for claims up to the levels noted above, such claims, which are the primary component of our workers' compensation costs, are recorded in the period incurred. Workers' compensation insurance includes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Accordingly, the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates, which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment.\nDuring 2016 we incurred federal and state income tax expense of $39.2 million on pre-tax income of $105.2 million. Our provision for income taxes differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible expenses. In addition, during 2016, as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting, we recognized income tax benefits of $1.5 million related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercise of non-qualified stock options. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 8 Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our effective income tax rate was 37.3% in 2016 compared to 40.0% in 2015.\n \u2022 Salaries, wages and payroll taxes - Salaries, wages and payroll taxes are primarily a function of the number of corporate employees, their associated average pay and any additional incentive compensation. Our corporate employees include client services, sales and marketing, benefits, legal, finance, information technology, administrative support personnel and those associated with our other products and services. \n\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU No. 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Under ASU No. 2014-09, an entity recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU No. 2014-09. We plan to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Under this method, the guidance is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. While our technical analysis is ongoing, we expect our revenue recognition policies to remain substantially unchanged as a result of adoption ASU No. 2014-09. Additionally, we do not anticipate any significant changes in our business processes or systems.\n- 43 -\n \u2022 employee travel and training expenses \n\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this annual report. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period.\nWe believe the effects of inflation have not had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 Workers' compensation costs - Workers' compensation costs increased 2.2%, but decreased $3 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2016. As a percentage of non-bonus payroll cost, workers' compensation costs decreased to 0.54% in 2017 from 0.59% in 2016. During 2017, we recorded reductions in workers' compensation costs of $16.3 million, \n (1) Adjusted to reflect the two-for-one split of our common stock effected on December 18, 2017 as a stock dividend. \n(1) Comprised primarily of revenues generated by our other products and services offerings.\n____________________________________\nOur growth in the number of worksite employees paid is affected by three primary sources: new client sales, client retention and the net change in existing clients through worksite employee new hires and layoffs. During 2017, new client sales improved over 2016, client retention declined slightly compared with 2016, and the net change in existing clients also declined compared with 2016. As a result, our year-over-year growth in average worksite employees paid per month in 2017 was 10.2% compared to 13.7% in 2016.\nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of non-bonus payroll costs:\n \u2022 rent expenses related to our service centers and sales offices \n____________________________________\n- 33 -\n \u2022 Commissions expense increased $3.5 million or 18.1%, but remained flat on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2016. Commissions are primarily associated with compensation to our sales force for sales of our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions. \nResults of Operations\n (1) Includes non-cash impairment and other charges in the first and second quarters of 2015 of $9.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, offset by a reduction of $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Please read Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Impairment Charges and Other,\u201d for additional information. \n \u2022 workers' compensation costs  Payroll taxes consist of the employer's portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, federal unemployment taxes and state unemployment taxes. Payroll taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll cost. The federal unemployment tax rates are defined by federal regulations. State unemployment tax rates are subject to claim histories and vary from state to state.\n \u2022 Salaries, wages and payroll taxes of corporate and sales staff increased 8.8%, but decreased $5 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a 5.8% rise in headcount, including a 9.9% increase in BPAs in 2016. \n \u2022 Advertising costs increased 2.9%, but decreased $1 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015, primarily due to increased spending on Internet advertising. \n- 49 -\n \u2022 Operating results - Our net income has a significant impact on our operating cash flows. Our net income increased 27.9% to $84.4 million in 2017 from $66.0 million in 2016. Please read Results of Operations-Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016.\u201d \nOur net cash flows from operating activities in 2017 were $204.4 million. Our primary source of cash from operations is the comprehensive service fee and payroll funding we collect from our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients. Cash and cash equivalents, and thus our reported cash flows from operating activities, are significantly impacted by various external and internal factors, which are reflected in part by the changes in our balance sheet accounts. These include the following:\n \u2022 Allowance for doubtful accounts - We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to pay their comprehensive service fees. We believe that the success of our business is heavily dependent on our ability to collect these comprehensive service fees for several reasons, including: \n\nWe believe that we have implemented the accounting pronouncements with a material impact on our financial statements and do not believe there are any new or pending pronouncements that will materially impact our financial position or results of operations.\n \u2022 Deferred taxes - We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, our ability to realize our deferred tax assets could change from our current estimates. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period that such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would reduce net income in the period such determination is made. In 2017, we reduced our deferred tax assets by $2.5 million due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act. This is a provisional amount reflecting our estimate of the impact of the income tax effect of the 2017 Tax Reform Act on our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. After we finalize certain tax positions when we file our 2017 US tax return, we will be able to conclude whether any further adjustments are required to our net deferred tax asset balance of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of income tax expense in the reporting period the adjustments are made, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. \ninclude revenues that have been recognized but not invoiced in unbilled accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn addition to our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions, we offer a number of other business performance solutions, including Human Capital Management, Payroll Services, Time and Attendance, Performance Management, Organizational Planning, Recruiting Services, Employment Screening and Expense Management Services, Retirement Services and Insurance Services, many of which are offered via desktop applications and cloud-based delivery models. These other products or services are offered separately, as a bundle, or along with our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions.\nFollowing is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:\nNet income in 2017 was $84.4 million, a 27.9% increase compared to 2016. Our adjusted net income in 2017 was $103.0 million, a 34.3% increase compared to 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 25.9% over 2016 to $177.7 million.\n- 44 -\nWe account for our revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605-45, Revenue Recognition. Our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions gross billings to clients include the payroll cost of each worksite employee at the client location and a markup computed as a percentage of each worksite employee's payroll cost. We invoice the gross billings concurrently with each periodic payroll of our worksite employees. Revenues, which exclude the payroll cost component of gross billings, and therefore, consist solely of the markup, are recognized ratably over the payroll period as worksite employees perform their service at the client worksite. This markup includes pricing components associated with our estimates of payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation costs, plus a separate component related to our HR services. We\nOur net cash flows used in financing activities were $102.9 million during 2017. We repurchased $38.7 million in stock and paid $65.8 million in dividends, including a special cash dividend of $41.7 million paid in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe percentage of total PEO HR Outsourcing solutions revenues in our significant markets include the following:\n \u2022 outside professional service fees related to legal, consulting and accounting services \n \u2022 administrative costs, such as postage, printing and supplies \n \u2022 Workers' compensation costs - Workers' compensation costs increased 0.6%, but decreased $5 on a per worksite employee per month basis, compared to 2015. As a percentage of non-bonus payroll cost, workers' compensation costs decreased to 0.59% in 2016 from 0.68% in 2015. During 2016, as a result of closing out claims at lower than expected costs, we recorded reductions in workers' compensation costs of $10.9 million, or 0.08% of non-bonus payroll costs, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods, compared to $1.3 million, or 0.01% of non-bonus payroll costs, in 2015. \n \u2022 Benefits costs - The cost of group health insurance and related employee benefits increased $2 per worksite employee per month, or 2.0%, on a per covered employee basis compared to 2015. Included in 2016 benefits costs is a charge of $5.1 million, or $3 per worksite employee per month, for changes in estimated claims run-off related to prior periods. The percentage of worksite employees covered under our health insurance plan was 69.2% in 2016 and 70.4% in 2015. Please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Benefits Costs\u201d for a discussion of our accounting for health insurance costs. \n \u2022 the large volume and dollar amount of transactions we process \nOur gross profit per worksite employee is primarily determined by our ability to accurately estimate and control direct costs and our ability to incorporate changes in these costs into the gross billings charged to PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients, which are subject to pricing arrangements that are typically renewed annually. We use gross profit per worksite employee per month as our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level.\n \u2022 Payroll tax costs - Payroll taxes increased 12.6%, or $12 per worksite employee per month, compared to 2016, due to a 12.6% increase in total payroll cost in 2017. Payroll taxes as a percentage of payroll cost increased slightly to 6.85% in 2017 compared to 6.84% in 2016.  Operating Expenses\nOur quarterly earnings are impacted by the seasonal nature of our medical claims costs and payroll taxes. Typically, medical claims costs tend to increase throughout the year with the fourth quarter being the period with the highest costs, which has a negative impact on our fourth quarter earnings. This trend is primarily the result of many worksite employees' medical plan deductibles being fully met by the fourth quarter, which increases our liability with respect to those claims. We have also experienced variability on a quarterly basis in medical claims costs based on the unpredictable nature of large claims. Payroll taxes and associated billings are computed based on an employee's annual taxable wage base. The annual payroll tax wage bases are frequently met in the first two quarters of each year depending on the employee's compensation levels. As a result, the gross profit contribution from payroll taxes is typically higher in the first two quarters and declines in the latter half of each year. These historical trends may change and other seasonal trends may develop in the future. For further information related to our health insurance costs, please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Benefits Costs.\u201d\nEBITDA represents net income computed in accordance with GAAP, plus interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA plus non-cash impairments, stockholder advisory expenses, charitable donations related to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts and stock-based compensation, is based on the definition in our credit facility. We believe EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are often useful measures of our operating performance, as they allow for additional analysis of our operating results separate from the impact of these items, and Adjusted EBITDA is used by our lenders to assess our leverage and ability to make interest payments.\nThe following table presents certain information related to our results of operations:\n____________________________________\nRevenues\n- 32 -\n\n- 41 -\n (2) Please read -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n- 39 -\nWe ended 2017 averaging 189,513 paid worksite employees in the fourth quarter, which represents a 9.8% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Approximately 23.6% and 24.5% of our average paid worksite employees were in our middle market sector for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is generally defined as companies with 150 to 2,000 worksite employees. We expect the average number of paid worksite employees per month to be between 193,500 and 195,300 in the first quarter of 2018.\nWe believe that recent claims activity is representative of incurred and paid trends during the reporting period. The estimated completion rate and annual trend used to compute incurred but not reported claims involves a significant level of judgment. Accordingly, an increase (or decrease) in the completion rate or annual trend used to estimate the incurred claims would result in an increase (or decrease) in benefits costs and net income would decrease (or increase) accordingly.\n- 46 -\nDuring 2017 we incurred federal and state income tax expense of $45.7 million on pre-tax income of $130.1 million. Our provision for income taxes differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, non-deductible expenses, including a non-cash tax charge of $2.5 million related to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act and $6.2 million of tax benefits associated with equity compensation. Our effective income tax rate was 35.1% in 2017 compared to 37.3% in 2016.\nGross Profit\nOverview\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables below.\nNon-bonus payroll cost is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of bonus payrolls paid to our worksite employees. Bonus payroll cost varies from period to period, but has no direct impact to our ultimate workers' compensation costs under the current program. As a result, our management refers to non-bonus payroll cost in analyzing, reporting and forecasting our workers' compensation costs. We include these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency related to the costs incurred under our current workers' compensation program.\n \u2022 General and administrative expenses - Our general and administrative expenses primarily include: \nThe statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The actual results of the future events described in such forward-looking statements in this annual report could differ materially from those stated in such forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in our other public reports and filings and public statements.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 Impairment charges and other - Impairment charges and other consist of non-cash expense associated with the decline in fair value of long-lived and intangible assets, including goodwill. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 6 Impairment Charges and Other,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  Other Income (Expense)\n \u2022 costs of employee benefit plans \nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The ASU eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (formerly, Step 2) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, companies are required to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (formerly, Step 1). The guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 16, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Companies should apply this ASU on a prospective basis. We adopted ASU No. 2017-04 on January 1, 2017.\n\n____________________________________", "item_7_tables": "Table 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

" Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Insperity provides human resources services and business performance solutions to small and medium-sized businesses. Its most comprehensive offerings are the Workforce Optimization\u00ae and Workforce SynchronizationTM solutions.\n\n2017 Financial Highlights\n- Revenues increased 12.2% to $3.3 billion, driven by a 10.2% increase in average number of worksite employees paid per month.\n- Gross profit increased 16.5% to $572.7 million. Gross profit per worksite employee per month was $261. \n- Operating income increased 22.2% to $129.9 million.\n- Net income increased 27.9% to $84.4 million.\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 25.9% to $177.7 million.\n\nSeasonality \n- Medical claims costs tend to increase through the year and are highest in Q4. This reduces Q4 earnings.\n- Payroll taxes are higher in Q1 and Q2 as tax wage bases are met earlier in the year.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Key estimates include workers' compensation claims estimates, health insurance claims estimates, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation allowances on tax assets, contingencies, and asset impairment analysis.\n\nCash Flows\n- Operating cash flows were $204.4 million. Investing activities used $33.3 million, primarily for capital expenditures. Financing activities used $102.9 million, largely for dividends and share repurchases.\n\nDoes this help summarize the key points?
