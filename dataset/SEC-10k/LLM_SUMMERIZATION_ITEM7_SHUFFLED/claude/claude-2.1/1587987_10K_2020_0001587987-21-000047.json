MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIntroduction and Certain Cautionary Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nThe statements in this Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated future financial performance, business prospects, legislative developments and similar matters. We note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed in the forward-looking statements such as intensified competition and/or operating problems in our operating business projects and their impact on revenues and profit margins or additional factors as described under Risk Factors\u201d above.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a leading national non-bank lender and own and control certain portfolio companies under the Newtek\u00ae brand (our controlled portfolio companies,\u201d as defined below) that provide a wide range of business and financial solutions to SMBs. Newtek's and its portfolio companies' business and financial solutions include: Business Lending, including origination of SBA 7(a), SBA 504, and nonconforming (non SBA) conventional loans, as well as PPP loans in the second and third quarters of 2020, Electronic Payment Processing, Managed Technology Solutions (Cloud Computing), Technology Consulting, eCommerce, Accounts Receivable and Inventory Financing, personal and commercial Insurance Services, Web Services, Data Backup, Storage and Retrieval, and Payroll and Benefits Solutions to SMB accounts nationwide across all industries. We have an established and reliable platform that is not limited by client size, industry type, or location. As a result, we believe we have a strong and diversified client base across every state in the United States. and across a variety of different industries. In addition, we have developed a financial and technology based business model that enables us and our controlled portfolio companies to acquire and process our SMB clients in a very cost effective manner. This capability is supported in large part by NewTracker\u00ae, our patented prospect management technology software, which is similar to, but we believe better suited for our needs than, the system popularized by Salesforce.com. We believe that this technology and business model distinguishes us from our competitors.\nWe consolidate the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Small Business Finance, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Asset Backed Securities, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCC Real Estate Holdings, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Whitestone Group, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire DC Partners, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Holdings I, Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana BIDCO, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners II, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners III, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners IV, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Advisers II, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Partners III, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Partners, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exponential Business Development Co., Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Commercial Lending, Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek LSP Holdco, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 1, Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 2, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 3, Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 4, Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 5, Inc.

In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with our 2015 tax year. As a BDC and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. As a result, previously consolidated subsidiaries are now recorded as investments in controlled portfolio companies, at fair value. NSBF is a consolidated subsidiary and originates loans under the SBA's 7(a) loan program.\nOur common shares are currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol NEWT\u201d.\nNSBF, a nationally licensed SBA lender under the federal Section 7(a) loan program, has been granted PLP status and originates, sells and services SBA 7(a) loans and is authorized to place SBA guarantees on loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Being a national lender with PLP status allows NSBF to expedite the origination of loans since NSBF is not required to present applications to the SBA for concurrent review and approval. The loss of PLP status would adversely impact our marketing efforts and ultimately our loan origination volume which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs a BDC, our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily through loans originated by our business finance ecosystem and our equity investments in certain portfolio companies that we control.\nWe target our debt investments, which are principally made through our business finance ecosystem under the SBA 7(a) program, to produce a coupon rate of prime plus 2.25% to 2.75% which enables us to generate rapid sales of guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. We typically structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral along with personal guarantees from portfolio company owners, in many cases collateralized by other assets including real estate. In most cases, our debt investment will be collateralized by a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company and a first or second lien on assets of guarantors, in both cases primarily real estate. All SBA loans are made with personal guarantees from any owner(s) of 20% or more of the portfolio company's equity. The amount of new debt investments, particularly SBA 7(a) loans that we originate, will directly impact future investment income. In addition, future amounts of unrealized appreciation or depreciation on our investments, as well as the amount of realized gains or losses, will also fluctuate depending upon economic conditions and the performance of our investment portfolio. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results.\nWe typically structure our debt investments to include non-financial covenants that seek to minimize our risk of capital loss such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. Our debt investments have what we believe are strong protections, including default penalties, information rights and, in some cases, board observation rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Debt investments in portfolio companies, including the controlled portfolio companies, have historically and are expected to continue to comprise the majority of our overall investments in number and dollar volume.\nWhile the vast majority of our investments have been structured as debt, we have in the past and expect in the future to make selective equity investments primarily as either strategic investments to enhance the integrated operating platform or, to a lesser degree, under the Capco programs. For investments in our controlled portfolio companies, we focus more on tailoring them to the long term growth needs of the companies than to return. Our objectives with these companies is to foster the development of the businesses as a part of the integrated operational platform of serving the SMB market, so we may reduce the burden on these companies to enable them to grow faster than they would otherwise and as another means of supporting their development.\nWe regularly engage in discussions with third parties with respect to various potential transactions. We may acquire an investment or a portfolio of investments or an entire company or sell a portion of our portfolio on an opportunistic basis. We, our subsidiaries, or our affiliates may also agree to manage certain other funds that invest in debt, equity or provide other financing or services to companies in a variety of industries for which we may earn management or other fees for our services. We may also invest in the equity of these funds, along with other third parties, from which we would seek to earn a return and/or future incentive allocations. We may enter into new joint venture partnerships to create additional third-party capital to originate loans. Some of these transactions could be material to our business. Consummation of any such transaction will be subject to completion of due diligence, finalization of key business and financial terms (including price) and negotiation of final definitive documentation as well as a number of other factors and conditions including, without limitation, the approval of our board of directors and required regulatory or third-party consents and, in certain cases, the approval of our shareholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any such transaction would be consummated. Any of these transactions or funds may require significant management resources either during the transaction phase or on an ongoing basis depending on the terms of the transaction.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and established the PPP. Specifically, the CARES Act included $349 billion to establish the PPP that expanded the existing SBA Section 7(a) loan program until June 30, 2020 to provide 100% federally-backed loans to eligible businesses. Subsequently, on April 3, 2020, the SBA, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Treasury (the Treasury\u201d), adopted the PPP interim final rule (the Regulations\u201d) to implement the PPP and effectuate the expansion of the Section 7(a) loan program. The Regulations established additional rules and requirements of the PPP, including loan forgiveness, and were amended from time to time to provide additional guidance and clarifications. Congress approved additional funding for the PPP of approximately $320 billion on April 24, 2020. As a result of the uncertain economic impact to U.S. small businesses created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's Executive Committee and Lending Team temporarily shifted the focus of NSBF from originating SBA 7(a) loans to originating PPP loans beginning in March 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NSBF funded approximately 10,500 PPP loans totaling $1.19 billion. On July 4, 2020, a bill was passed to re-open the application window for the PPP until August 8, 2020. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d We continue to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related to the PPP, but there can be no assurance that the PPP will be further reauthorized, or that NSBF will be qualified to participate in any further reauthorization.\nCOVID-19 Developments\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Shortly thereafter, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency throughout the United States attributable to such outbreak. The outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States, including in the markets in which the Company operates. In accordance with guidance from various state and local governments, the majority of the Company's employees continue to work remotely, which has not impacted our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nWe have and continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our portfolio companies. We cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its duration in the United States and worldwide, the effectiveness of governmental responses designed to mitigate the strain to businesses and the economy, and the magnitude of the economic impact of the outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its spread have caused, and are continuing to cause, business shutdowns, cancellations of events and travel, significant reductions in demand for certain goods and services, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability both globally and in the United States. Such effects will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and for some period thereafter.\nWhile several countries, as well as certain states, counties and cities in the United States, have relaxed initial public health restrictions with a view to partially or fully reopening their economies, many cities world-wide have since experienced a surge in the reported number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases have led to the re-introduction of restrictions and business shutdowns in certain states, counties and cities in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions and business shutdowns elsewhere. Additionally, as of late December 2020, travelers from the United States were not allowed to visit Canada, Australia, or the majority of countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. These continued travel restrictions may prolong the global economic downturn. In addition, although the Federal Food and Drug Administration authorized vaccines for emergency use starting in December 2020, it remains unclear how quickly the vaccine will be distributed nationwide and globally or when herd immunity\u201d will be achieved and the restrictions that were imposed to slow the spread of the virus will be lifted entirely. The delay in distributing the vaccines could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and most other major global\neconomics may continue to experience a recession, and we anticipate our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the U.S. and other major markets. Some economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a world-wide economic downturn.\nAs such, we are unable to predict the duration of any business and supply-chain disruptions, the extent to which COVID-19 will negatively affect our and our portfolio companies' operating results or the impact that such disruptions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. Though the magnitude of the impact remains to be seen, we expect our portfolio companies to potentially be negatively impacted. We believe that certain negative impacts to our SBA 7(a) borrowers may have been muted, in part, due to provisions of the CARES Act that provided for six months of principal, interest and fees to be paid by the SBA directly to NSBF beginning in April 2020. With the end of the SBA's payment of principal, interest and fees on behalf of our SBA 7(a) borrowers, we may see increases in loan delinquencies and borrowers requesting loan deferments. A deferment is the postponement of scheduled loan payments of principal and/or interest to a later date. Generally, the amount deferred should not exceed six cumulative monthly payments or 20% of the original amount of loan, whichever is less. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced and may continue to experience a decline in SBA 7(a) loan originations and gains on sale from guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans.\nMoreover, COVID-19 has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact our operations and the operations of our borrowers, customers, portfolio companies and business partners. For example, as a result of the significant uncertainty due to COVID-19 we could experience declining values of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position, including possible constraints on liquidity and capital, as well as higher costs of capital. A number of factors impacting us or our portfolio companies, borrowers, customers or business partners could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, including but not limited to:\n\u2022increases in loan delinquencies, losses and charge-offs;\n\u2022increases in borrowers seeking and being granted deferments of principal and interest payments, which could negatively impact cash flow from net interest and servicing payments normally available to the Company, during the deferment period;\n\u2022collateral for loans, including real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022demand for our, and our portfolio companies', business products and solutions may decline, making it difficult to grow or maintain our assets and income;\n\u2022net worth and liquidity of the guarantors on our loans may decline, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022our risk management policies and practices may be negatively impacted by among, other things, changes in the SBA 7(a) Program, including changes to SBA Loan Program Requirements;\n\u2022cyber risk has increased as criminals have sought to take advantage of the changes of business practices necessitated by COVID-19.\nWe are continuing to assess what additional adverse financial and operational consequences may result from the global spread of COVID-19 and the associated economic turbulence, however, the extent of such consequences remains uncertain as of the filing of this Form 10-K as we do not believe there have been comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest, dividend, servicing and other fee income on debt and equity investments. Our debt investments typically have terms of 10 to 25 years and bear interest at prime plus a margin. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA investments which we originate and sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of packaging, prepayment, legal and late fees. We record such fees related to loans as other income. Dividends are recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain. In addition, under the PPP that began in the second quarter of 2020, the SBA reimburses the Company for originating loans and such SBA reimbursements are included as interest income on PPP loans. Income earned in connection with the PPP should not be viewed as recurring. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. Congress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and assets that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments or servicing assets, as appropriate, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses are salaries and benefits, interest expense, origination and servicing and other general and administrative costs, such as professional fees, marketing, referral fees, servicing costs and rent. Since we are an internally-managed BDC with no outside adviser or management company, the BDC incurs all the related costs to operate the Company.\nGuarantees\nThe Company is a guarantor on the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility at NBC. Maximum borrowings under the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility are $35,000,000. The Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility matures in August 2022 and automatically renews annually. At December 31, 2020, total principal owed by NBC was $18,411,000. In addition, the Company deposited $750,000 to collateralize the guarantee. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nThe Company is a guarantor on the NBL Facility. Maximum borrowings under the NBL Facility are $75,000,000 with an accordion feature to increase maximum borrowings to $150,000,000. The lenders' commitments terminate in November 2022, with all amounts due under the NBL Facility maturing in November 2023. At December 31, 2020, total principal owed by NBL was $44,216,000. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nThe Company is a guarantor on the Webster Facility, a term loan facility between NMS with Webster Bank with an aggregate principal amount up to $50,000,000. The Webster Facility matures in November 2023. At December 31, 2020, total principal outstanding was $36,375,000. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nNewtek Conventional Lending, LLC (NCL)\nWe established a 50/50 joint venture between Newtek Commercial Lending, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newtek, and Conventional Lending TCP Holding, LLC, a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (Nasdaq:TCPC). NCL provides non-conforming conventional commercial and industrial term loans to U.S. middle-market companies and small businesses. Refer to NOTE 3-INVESTMENTS for selected financial information and a schedule of investments of NCL as of December 31, 2020.\nUnfunded Commitments\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had $3,263,000 of unfunded commitments in connection with its SBA 7(a) non-affiliate investments related to portions of loans originated which are partially funded. The Company will fund these commitments from the same sources it uses to fund its other investment commitments.\nAt December 31, 2020, NCL had $568,000 of unfunded commitments in connection with partial funding of certain of its non-conforming conventional commercial and industrial term loan investments. NCL will fund 50% of the total unfunded commitments. NCL will fund these commitments from the same sources it uses to fund its other investment commitments.\nLoan Portfolio Asset Quality and Composition\nThe following tables set forth distributions of the cost basis of the Company's SBA 7(a) loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, in thousands. The tables include loans in which NSBF owns 100% as a result of NSBF originating the loan and subsequently repurchasing the guaranteed portion from the SBA. The total of 100% NSBF-owned loans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is $16,931,000 and $11,307,000, respectively.\nDistribution by Business Type\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

Under the PPP, current SBA 7(a) lenders were automatically approved to extend 100% federally guaranteed PPP loans to certain small businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NSBF originated $1.19 billion of PPP loans resulting in $37,743,000 of fees generated. Pursuant to the PPP, the interest rate on PPP loans is capped at 1.0%. In addition, the SBA will reimburse a lender authorized to make a PPP loan at a rate, based on the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the PPP loan, of: (i) 5% for PPP loans of not more than $350,000; (ii) 3% for loans of more than $350,000 and less than $2,000,000; and (iii) 1% for loans of not less than $2,000,000. Such SBA reimbursements are included in Interest Income - PPP Loans. Income earned in connection with the PPP should not be viewed as recurring. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. Congress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d\nThe decrease in interest income from SBA 7(a) loans was attributable to the decrease in the average Prime Rate in effect on our portfolio from 5.38% to 3.63% over the twelve month period. The decrease was partially offset by $451,000 of interest income relating to the full payoff of a loan in non-accrual status during the second quarter of 2020, as well as the average outstanding accrual portfolio of SBA non-affiliate investments increasing to $363,907,000 from $339,128,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the average outstanding accrual portfolio resulted from the origination of new SBA non-affiliate investments period over period.\nDividend Income\nDividend income was earned from the following portfolio companies for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Merchant Solutions, LLC (NMS) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,040) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Professional Marketing, Inc. </td> <td>350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(550) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SIDCO, LLC </td> <td>825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobil Money, LLC </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(375) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Conventional Lending, LLC </td> <td>1,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>405 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Lending, LLC </td> <td>1,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMCAP Loan Holdings, LLC </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total dividend income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(842) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividend income is dependent on portfolio company earnings. Current year dividend income may not be indicative of future period dividend income, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. See COVID-19 Developments.\u201d\nThe decrease in dividend income was driven by dividend income related to our payment processing portfolio company, NMS, decreasing $2,040,000 period over period due to COVID-19 pandemic-related lower processing volumes. The decrease was offset by $1,600,000 of dividend income from NCL for year ended December 31, 2020, which stemmed from NCL's achievement of profitability in 2020 and positive net income for the year.\nNSBF Servicing Portfolio and Related Servicing Income\nThe following table represents the NSBF originated servicing portfolio and servicing income earned for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands): </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total NSBF originated servicing portfolio </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,704,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,770,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(66,704) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total average NSBF originated portfolio earning servicing income\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,109,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,031,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,895 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total servicing income earned </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,076 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in servicing income was attributable to the increase in total portfolio investments for which we earn servicing income. The portfolio earning servicing income increased $77,895,000 period over period. The increase was attributable to an increase in SBA 7(a) non-affiliate investments period over period.\nOther Income\nOther income relates primarily to legal, packaging, prepayment, and late fees earned from SBA 7(a) loans. The decrease was\nrelated to an decrease in legal, prepayment and packaging fees earned as a result of the lower volume of SBA 7(a) loans originated of $196,752,000 compared to $517,692,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The decreases in interest expense from Bank notes payable and Notes payable - related parties were related to a decrease in the average outstanding balance and interest rates period over period. The decrease in interest expense related to our redemption of the 2022 Notes was offset by an additional $2,356,000 of interest from the issuance of $63,250,000 of 2024 Notes and $37,000 of interest from the issuance of $5,000,000 2025 Notes.\nOrigination and Loan Processing\nThe decrease in Origination and Loan Processing expenses was attributed to a decrease in SBA 7(a) loan fundings.\nNet Realized Gains and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation\nNet realized gains from SBA non-affiliate investments for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $11,368,000 and $47,816,000, respectively, which included realized losses of $8,367,000 and $3,924,000, respectively.\nNet Realized Gains on SBA Non-Affiliate Investments\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td># of Debt Investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Amount\n(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td># of Debt Investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Amount\n(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA non-affiliate investments originated </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>517,692 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments sold </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>153,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>394,248 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains recognized on sale of SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,740 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average sale price as a percent of principal balance1\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110.78 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111.16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Realized gains greater than 110.00% must be split 50/50 with the SBA in accordance with SBA regulations.

At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Notes.\nCapital One Facilities\nIn May 2017, NSBF amended its Capital One facility to increase the facility from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000 and reduce the interest rate. The facility was amended again in June 2018 and the portion of the facility collateralized by the government guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime minus 0.75% (previously Prime minus 0.25%). The interest rate on the portion of the facility, collateralized by the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime plus 0.25% (previously Prime plus 0.75%). The facility provides for a 55% advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates, and a 90% advance rate on the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates. In addition, the amendment extended the date on which the facility will convert to a term loan from May 16, 2017 to May 11, 2020 and extended the maturity date of the facility to May 11, 2022. In June 2019, the facility was increased from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000. In April 2020, Capital One advised NSBF that it was establishing a reserve against the non-guaranteed borrowing base, which reserve effectively reduced the advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates by 50%. On May 7, 2020, NSBF amended its existing line of credit with Capital One to, among other things, extend the maturity date on which the credit facility will convert into a term loan for a period of three years to May 7, 2023, with the term loan maturing on May 7, 2025.\nAt December 31, 2020, there was $33,839,000 and $52,500,000 outstanding under the unguaranteed and guaranteed lines of credit, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we were in full compliance with all applicable loan covenants.\nNotes Payable - Related Parties\nIn June 2015, the Company entered into the Related Party RLOC with certain controlled portfolio companies. Maximum borrowings under the Related Party RLOC were $38,000,000. In June 2017, the Related Party RLOC was amended to increase maximum borrowings to $50,000,000. The outstanding balance had an interest rate equal to 1 month LIBOR (with a floor of 0.50%) plus 6.0% or at a rate equal to the greater of the Prime Rate or 3.5% plus 5.0%. In November 2018, the Related Party RLOC was amended to reduce the interest rate to the lesser of 1 month LIBOR plus 2.5% or the Prime Rate plus 1.5%.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Related Party RLOC interest rate was 2.74%. The Related Party RLOC has a maturity date of November 8, 2023. Outstanding borrowings due to NMS at December 31, 2020 were $24,090,000.\nSecuritization Transactions\nSince 2010, NSBF has engaged in securitizations of the unguaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans. In the securitization, it uses a special purpose entity (the Trust\u201d) which is considered a variable interest entity. Applying the consolidation requirements for VIEs under the accounting rules in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, and ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which became effective January 1, 2010, the Company determined that as the primary beneficiary of the securitization vehicle, based on its power to direct activities through its role as servicer for the Trust and its obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits, it needed to consolidate the Trusts. NSBF therefore consolidated the entity using the carrying amounts of the Trust's assets and liabilities. NSBF reflects the assets in SBA Unguaranteed Non-Affiliate Investments and reflects the associated financing in Notes Payable - Securitization trusts on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nIn November 2016, NSBF completed its seventh securitization which resulted in the transfer of $56,073,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2016-1 Trust. The 2016-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $53,444,000, consisting of $43,632,000 Class A notes and $9,812,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB+\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2042. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at an average rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 3.0% and 4.25%, respectively. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative index over which it has no direct control and which is readily verifiable, in accordance with the terms of the 2016-1 securitization transaction documents.\nIn December 2017, NSBF completed its eighth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $76,188,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2017-1 Trust. The 2017-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $75,426,000, consisting of $58,111,000 Class A notes and $17,315,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2043. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at a rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 2.0% and 3.0%, respectively. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative index over which it has no direct control and which is readily verifiable, in accordance with the terms of the 2017-1 securitization transaction documents.\nIn October 2018, the 2013-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2013-1 Trust assets, with the 2013-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price. Certain of the 2013-1 Trust's assets were subsequently transferred to the 2018-1 Trust.\nIn November 2018, NSBF completed its ninth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $108,551,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2018-1 Trust. The 2018-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $108,551,000, consisting of $82,876,000 Class A notes and $25,675,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2044. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative index over which it has no direct control and which is readily verifiable, in accordance with the terms of the 2018-1 securitization transaction documents.\nIn March 2019, the 2010-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2010-1 Trust assets, with the 2010-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price.\nIn July 2019, the 2014-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2014-1 Trust assets, with the 2014-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price.\nIn October 2019, NSBF completed its tenth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $118,920,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2019-1 Trust, The 2019-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $118,920,000, consisting of $93,540,000 of Class A notes and $25,380,000 Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is December 2044. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at an average rate of LIBOR plus 1.83% across both classes. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative in accordance with the terms of the 2019-1 securitization transaction documents.\nPPP Loan Participations\nBeginning in April 2020, NSBF engaged in the origination of PPP loans. This first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. During the duration of the first round of PPP during 2020, NSBF funded approximately 10,570 PPP loans totaling $1.19 billion. To facilitate NSBF's involvement as a lender in the PPP, during the second quarter of 2020, NSBF entered into PPP loan participation agreements where NSBF originated PPP loans and sold 90% participating interests to UBS Bank USA ( UBS\u201d), Stifel Bank ( Stifel\u201d), Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. ( Morgan Stanley\u201d), and Amalgamated Bank ( Amalgamated\u201d), collectively, the Participants.\u201d The participations were sold at par due to the short term maturity of the loans. NSBF and the Participants share proportionally in all interest and principal payments made on the loans. Subsequently, UBS, Stifel and Amalgamated amended their participation agreements with NSBF to allow the banks purchase up to 100% participation interests in certain of the PPP loans originated by NSBF. In connection with the amendments, UBS, Stifel, and Amalgamated purchased the remaining 10% participation interests in their participation loans, bringing their participation interests to 100%, while Morgan Stanley continues to hold 90% participation interests as of December 31, 2020. In total, during 2020, NSBF sold participations in $1.19 billion of PPP loans and continues to hold the PPP loan notes and the PPP loan documents in order to service the loans. The servicing liability in connection with the PPP loans was deemed immaterial. PPP loan origination fees are recognized as interest income on sale of PPP loan participations.\nA transfer of financial assets must meet the sale criteria under the accounting rules in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, in order to be considered a sale instead of a secured borrowing. The Company determined that the sale criteria are met and the Participants' interests in the PPP loans are not held on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As stated in the PPP loan participation agreements, the intention of the parties is for the participation agreements to be absolute and true sales and not secured borrowings. In accordance with the terms of the PPP loan participation agreements and SBA regulations and guidance, NSBF, as the originating lender, retains all servicing rights and is the party responsible to the SBA with respect to all servicing actions, including requests for advance purchases and loan forgiveness, and will be the party eligible for the guarantee purchase of the PPP loan. For the 100% participations, the entire financial asset is considered to have been sold since a 100% ownership interest in the underlying asset's cash flows has been sold to a third party and only the servicing rights remain with NSBF. For the 90% participations, the transfers met all the conditions of a participating interest as defined by ASC 860 to potentially qualify for sale accounting including (i) there is a proportionate ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (ii) all cash flows are divided proportionately among the participants, (iii) the parties' rights are parri passu, and (iv) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire PPP loan unless all participating interest holders agree. The Company obtained true sale opinions and concluded that legal isolation is met under ASC 860-10-45-5a. As required under ASC 860 for sale accounting, the Company does not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets, except for standard representations and warranties, such as in the event of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct on the part of the Company, or failure to meet the ongoing contractual obligations to service the PPP loans. Owners of participations in PPP loans also have credit protection in the form of a 100% irrevocable government guarantee.\nCongress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which, among other things, provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d We continue to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related to the PPP, but there can be no assurance that the PPP will be further reauthorized, or that NSBF will be qualified to participate in any further reauthorization.\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's unused sources of liquidity consisted of $2,765,000 available through the Capital One facility; $6,217,000 available through notes payable with related parties; and $2,073,000 in unrestricted cash.\nRestricted cash of $49,352,000 as of December 31, 2020 is primarily held by NSBF. The majority, or $48,600,000 of restricted cash includes reserves in the event payments are insufficient to cover interest and/or principal with respect to securitizations and loan principal and interest collected which are due to loan participants.\nThe Company generated and used cash as follows:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(88,957) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td>465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash </td> <td>18,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and restricted cash, beginning of period </td> <td>33,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and restricted cash, end of period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,207 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities provided cash of $17,763,000, consisting primarily of (i) $1,356,710,000 of proceeds from the sale of SBA 7(a) guaranteed loan investments, (ii) $61,976,000 of principal payments received from SBA non-affiliate investments and (iii) $19,221,000 in return of investment from controlled investments.\nThese increases were offset by (i) $1,389,763,000 of SBA 7(a) and PPP loan investments funded and (ii) $51,437,000 of investments in controlled portfolio companies, including $4,957,000 in NCL and $40,285,000 in NBL.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $465,000 consisting primarily of (i) $54,885,000 of principal payments related to securitization notes payable and (ii) $42,583,000 of dividend payments.\nThese uses were offset by (i) $25,571,000 of net proceeds from the sale of common shares under the 2019 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement and 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement, (ii) $56,339,000 of net borrowings under our bank notes payable, and (iii) net borrowings under the Related Party RLOC of $11,927,000.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table represents the Company's obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank notes payable </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitization notes payable1\n</td> <td>221,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes due 20231\n</td> <td>57,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes due 20241\n</td> <td>63,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes due 20251\n</td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable -

See NOTE 8-BORROWINGS.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board under our valuation policy and process. We may seek pricing information with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value such investments. We also employ independent third party valuation firms for certain of our investments for which there is not a readily available market value.\nThe application of our valuation methods may include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels for disclosure purposes. The Company carries all investments at fair value. Additionally, the Company carries its servicing assets at fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of the significant input to its valuation. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury, other U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain private equity investments, retained residual interests in securitizations, residential mortgage servicing rights, and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act was recently adopted by the SEC and establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are evaluating the impact of adopting Rule 2a-5 on the consolidated financial statements and intend to comply with the new rule's requirements on or before the compliance date in September 2022.\nValuation of Investments\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Company may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary methods for determining enterprise value include a discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA or revenue. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Company will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Company uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, the Company may base its valuation on quotes provided by an independent third party broker.\nFor certain investments, the Company generally calculates the fair value of the investment primarily based on the NAV of the entity and adjusts the fair value for other factors that would affect the fair value of the investment. The Company uses this valuation approach for its investment in NCL.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nThe Company's investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nChanges in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Our investment portfolio is carried on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities at fair value with any adjustments to fair value recognized as \"Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\" on the consolidated statements of operations until the investment is realized, usually upon exit, resulting in any gain or loss being recognized as a \"Net realized gains (losses).\"\nOur Board has the final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our determination of the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. We believe our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 approximates fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.\nValuation of Servicing Assets\nThe Company accounts for servicing assets in accordance with ASC 860-50 Transfers and Servicing - Servicing Assets and Liabilities. Servicing assets are measured at fair value at each reporting date and the Company reports changes in the fair value of servicing assets in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. The valuation model for servicing assets incorporates assumptions including, but not limited to, servicing costs, discount rate, prepayment rate, and default rate. Considerable judgement is required to estimate the fair value of servicing assets and as such these assets are classified as Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy.\nIncome Recognition\nManagement reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal or interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on management's designation of non-accrual status. Interest receivable is analyzed regularly and may be reserved against when deemed uncollectible. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nIn addition, under the PPP that began in the second quarter of 2020, the SBA reimburses the Company for originating loans. Such SBA reimbursements are included as interest income on PPP loans. Such fees are accounted for under ASC-310 Receivables and deferred until the loan is sold to one of our PPP Participants. Income earned in connection with the PPP should not be viewed as recurring. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. Congress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which provides for, among other things, funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d\nWe receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA loan investments which we sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned and recorded daily. Servicing income is earned for the full term of the loan or until the loan is repaid.\nWe receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including packaging fees, legal fees, late fees and prepayment fees. All other income is recorded when earned.\nDividends are recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from a portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns prior to fiscal year 2015 are generally closed, and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings.\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the 2015 tax year and operates in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. The RIC tax return includes Newtek Business Services Corp. and NSBF, a single member LLC disregarded for tax purposes. None of the Company's other subsidiaries are included in the RIC tax return. The Company will evaluate and record any deferred tax assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that are not included in the RIC tax return. In order to maintain its RIC tax treatment, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to any income that is distributed to its stockholders as dividends.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company would then pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no U.S. federal excise taxes were due.\nThe Company's Taxable Subsidiaries accrue income taxes payable based on the applicable corporate rates on the net unrealized appreciation generated by the controlled investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. Such deferred tax liabilities amounted to $11,406,000 and $12,405,000 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and are recorded as deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The change in deferred tax liabilities is included as a component of net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,( ASU 2020-04\u201d). ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts and transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective upon issuance of ASU 2020-04 for contract modifications on a prospective basis. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2020-04, the Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-X including the significance tests in the significant subsidiary\u201d definition in Rule 1-02(w), Securities Act Rule 405, and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 to improve their application and to assist registrants in making more meaningful determinations of whether a subsidiary or an acquired or disposed business is significant. In addition, to address the unique attributes of investment companies and business development companies, the SEC updated the significance tests in Rule 1-02(w), Securities Act Rule 405, and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 by (i) revising the investment test to compare the registrant's investments in and advances to the acquired or disposed business to the registrant's aggregate worldwide market value if available; (ii) revising the income test by adding a revenue component; (iii) expanding the use of pro forma financial information in measuring significance; and (iv) conforming, to the extent applicable, the significance threshold and tests for disposed businesses to those used for acquired businesses. The amendment became effective January 1, 2021; however, voluntary compliance with the final amendments will be permitted in advance of the effective date. No significant changes to our significant subsidiaries are expected.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, ( ASU 2020-08\u201d). This ASU clarifies that an entity should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of ASC paragraph 310-20-35-33 for each reporting period. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application is not permitted. All entities should apply ASU 2020-08 on a prospective basis as of the beginning of the period of adoption for existing or newly purchased callable debt securities. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements since the Company does not have any convertible debt.\nIn November 2020, the SEC published Release No. IC-34084 Use of Derivatives by Registered Investment Companies and Business Development Companies and adopted rules amending Rule 18f-4 and Rule 6c-11. Under the newly adopted rules, BDCs that use derivatives will be subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, a derivatives risk management program and testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These new requirements will apply unless the BDC qualifies as a limited derivatives user,\u201d as defined under the adopted rules. Under the new rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Compliance is required by August 19, 2022. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 815), ( ASU 2019-12\u201d). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 also improves the consistent application of, and simplifies, GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The standard is effective for all entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption was permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2019-12 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act was recently adopted by the SEC and establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are evaluating the impact of adopting Rule 2a-5 on the consolidated financial statements and intend to comply with the new rule's requirements on or before the compliance date in September 2022.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere were no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020.\nRecent Developments\nCommon Stock\nFrom January 1, 2021 through March 26, 2021 the Company sold 430,470 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $20.93 per share under the 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $9,011,000. As of March 26, 2021, there were 1,546,951 shares of common stock available for sale under the 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement.\nIssuance of Notes due 2025\nOn January 6, 2021 the Company completed an offering of $10 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.85% notes due 2025. The offering was consummated pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement dated November 27, 2020 among the Company and an accredited investor by a placement notice delivered to the purchaser prior to March 31, 2021. The purchase agreement provides for the Notes to be issued to the Purchaser in a private placement. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were approximately $9.7 million, after deducting structuring fees and estimated offering expenses, each payable by the Company. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to fund investments in debt and equity in accordance with its investment objectives and strategies. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company may, by mutual agreement of the parties, issue up to $15 million in aggregate principal amount of additional Notes by placement notice delivered to the Purchaser after March 31, 2021 and before November 30, 2022.\nIssuance of Notes due 2026 and Redemption of Notes due 2023\nOn January 22, 2021, the Company closed a public offering of $115,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 2026 Notes, including $15,000,000 in aggregate principal amount sold pursuant to a fully-exercised overallotment option. The 2026 Notes will mature on February 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at Newtek's option on or after February 1, 2022. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year payable quarterly on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1, of each year, beginning May 1, 2021. Total net proceeds received after deducting underwriters' discount and expenses was $11,287,500. The 2026 Notes are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol NEWTZ.\u201d A portion of the proceeds were used to redeem the outstanding 2023 Notes, which occurred on February 22, 2021.\nIssuance of Additional Notes due 2024\nOn February 16, 2021, the Company issued an additional $5,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 2024 Notes. The Notes are treated as a single series with the existing 2024 Notes and have the same terms as the 2024 Notes outstanding prior to February 16, 2021. The Notes will have the same CUSIP number and will be fungible and rank equally with the Existing Notes. Upon issuance of the Notes, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.75% Notes due 2024 increased to $68,250,000.\nDividends\nOn February 23, 2021, the Company declared a first quarter 2021 cash dividend of $0.50 per share, which is payable on March 31, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 22, 2021.\nPPP Additional Rounds\nOn December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was enacted by Congress in order to provide additional assistance to the hardest-hit small businesses, nonprofits, and venues that are struggling to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Economic Aid Act provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021 and a second round of forgivable loans through the PPP for small businesses and nonprofits experiencing significant revenue losses, made programmatic improvements to PPP, funds grants to shuttered venues, and enacted emergency enhancements to other SBA lending programs. This assistance will provide small business owners with the capital they need to survive the pandemic and includes critical resources for the smallest businesses. The Economic Aid Act also provides additional subsidies to certain existing SBA 7(a) borrowers. Specifically, under the Economic Aid Act, the SBA will pay an additional three months of payments of principal, interest, and fees on existing performing SBA 7(a) loans approved prior to March 27, 2020, capped at $9,000 per borrower per month and new SBA\n7(a) borrowers with loans approved from February 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, will receive 5 months of payments of principal, interest, and fees, capped at $9,000 per month. Beginning in January 2021, NSBF began offering PPP Second Draw Loans to eligible business. Eligibility for PPP Second Draw loans is limited to small businesses that have no more than 300 employees and demonstrate at least a 25 percent reduction in gross revenues between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020. PPP Second Draw loans have a maximum loan size of 2.5X average monthly payroll costs, up to $2 million. In addition, small businesses assigned to the industry NAICS code 72 (Accommodation and Food Services) can receive PPP Second Draw loans equal to 3.5X average monthly payroll costs in order to helps these businesses combat onerous State and local restrictions. Borrowers are eligible to receive full loan forgiveness if they spend at least 60 percent of their PPP Second Draw loan on payroll costs over a time period of their choosing between 8 weeks and 24 weeks. In addition, NSBF is also offering PPP loans (first draw loans) through March 31, 2021. For PPP loans made on or after December 27, 2020, SBA will pay lenders fees based on the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the loan, for processing PPP loans in the following amounts: (i) for loans of not more than $50,000, an amount equal to the lesser of fifty (50) percent or $2,500; (ii) five (5) percent for loans of more than $50,000 and not more than $350,000; (iii) three (3) percent for loans of more than $350,000 and less than $2,000,000; and (iv) one (1) percent for loans of at least $2,000,000.\nAs of the date of this filing, the PPP Extension Act of 2021 has been passed by Congress and the Senate and is pending signature by the President of the United States. The bill would extend the deadline to submit PPP applications from March 31, 2021 to May 31, 2021.", "item_7_truncated": "The decrease in Origination and Loan Processing expenses was attributed to a decrease in SBA 7(a) loan fundings.\nThe Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns prior to fiscal year 2015 are generally closed, and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Merchant Solutions, LLC (NMS) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,750) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,750) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Technology Solutions, Inc.

In addition, to address the unique attributes of investment companies and business development companies, the SEC updated the significance tests in Rule 1-02(w), Securities Act Rule 405, and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 by (i) revising the investment test to compare the registrant's investments in and advances to the acquired or disposed business to the registrant's aggregate worldwide market value if available; (ii) revising the income test by adding a revenue component; (iii) expanding the use of pro forma financial information in measuring significance; and (iv) conforming, to the extent applicable, the significance threshold and tests for disposed businesses to those used for acquired businesses.

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels for disclosure purposes. The Company carries all investments at fair value. Additionally, the Company carries its servicing assets at fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of the significant input to its valuation. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delinquency Status </td> <td> </td> <td># of Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Current </td> <td> </td> <td>2,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> 31 to 60 days </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> 61 to 90 days </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> 91 days or greater </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual </td> <td> </td> <td>182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>420,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Small Business Finance, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Asset Backed Securities, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCC Real Estate Holdings, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Whitestone Group, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire DC Partners, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Holdings I, Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana BIDCO, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners II, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners III, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners IV, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Advisers II, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Partners III, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Partners, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exponential Business Development Co., Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Commercial Lending, Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek LSP Holdco, LLC </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 1, Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 2, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn February 2018, the Company and the Trustee entered into the Third Supplemental Indenture to the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, relating to the Company's issuance, offer and sale of $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Notes due 2023.

Such effects will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and for some period thereafter.\nThe 2023 Notes were scheduled to mature on March 1, 2023 and could be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company's option at any time or from time to time on or after March 1, 2020, at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to but not including the date fixed for redemption. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.25% per year payable quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2018, and trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol NEWTI.\u201d The Company redeemed the 2023 Notes in February 2021. See NOTE 19-SUBSEQUENT EVENTS in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nThese increases were offset by (i) $1,389,763,000 of SBA 7(a) and PPP loan investments funded and (ii) $51,437,000 of investments in controlled portfolio companies, including $4,957,000 in NCL and $40,285,000 in NBL.\nIncome Recognition\n\nIn May 2017, NSBF amended its Capital One facility to increase the facility from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000 and reduce the interest rate. The facility was amended again in June 2018 and the portion of the facility collateralized by the government guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime minus 0.75% (previously Prime minus 0.25%). The interest rate on the portion of the facility, collateralized by the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime plus 0.25% (previously Prime plus 0.75%). The facility provides for a 55% advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates, and a 90% advance rate on the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates. In addition, the amendment extended the date on which the facility will convert to a term loan from May 16, 2017 to May 11, 2020 and extended the maturity date of the facility to May 11, 2022. In June 2019, the facility was increased from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000. In April 2020, Capital One advised NSBF that it was establishing a reserve against the non-guaranteed borrowing base, which reserve effectively reduced the advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates by 50%. On May 7, 2020, NSBF amended its existing line of credit with Capital One to, among other things, extend the maturity date on which the credit facility will convert into a term loan for a period of three years to May 7, 2023, with the term loan maturing on May 7, 2025.\n\nIn June 2015, the Company entered into the Related Party RLOC with certain controlled portfolio companies. Maximum borrowings under the Related Party RLOC were $38,000,000. In June 2017, the Related Party RLOC was amended to increase maximum borrowings to $50,000,000. The outstanding balance had an interest rate equal to 1 month LIBOR (with a floor of 0.50%) plus 6.0% or at a rate equal to the greater of the Prime Rate or 3.5% plus 5.0%. In November 2018, the Related Party RLOC was amended to reduce the interest rate to the lesser of 1 month LIBOR plus 2.5% or the Prime Rate plus 1.5%.\nWhile the vast majority of our investments have been structured as debt, we have in the past and expect in the future to make selective equity investments primarily as either strategic investments to enhance the integrated operating platform or, to a lesser degree, under the Capco programs. For investments in our controlled portfolio companies, we focus more on tailoring them to the long term growth needs of the companies than to return. Our objectives with these companies is to foster the development of the businesses as a part of the integrated operational platform of serving the SMB market, so we may reduce the burden on these companies to enable them to grow faster than they would otherwise and as another means of supporting their development.\nPPP Loan Participations\nBeginning in April 2020, NSBF engaged in the origination of PPP loans. This first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. During the duration of the first round of PPP during 2020, NSBF funded approximately 10,570 PPP loans totaling $1.19 billion. To facilitate NSBF's involvement as a lender in the PPP, during the second quarter of 2020, NSBF entered into PPP loan participation agreements where NSBF originated PPP loans and sold 90% participating interests to UBS Bank USA ( UBS\u201d), Stifel Bank ( Stifel\u201d), Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. ( Morgan Stanley\u201d), and Amalgamated Bank ( Amalgamated\u201d), collectively, the Participants.\u201d The participations were sold at par due to the short term maturity of the loans. NSBF and the Participants share proportionally in all interest and principal payments made on the loans. Subsequently, UBS, Stifel and Amalgamated amended their participation agreements with NSBF to allow the banks purchase up to 100% participation interests in certain of the PPP loans originated by NSBF. In connection with the amendments, UBS, Stifel, and Amalgamated purchased the remaining 10% participation interests in their participation loans, bringing their participation interests to 100%, while Morgan Stanley continues to hold 90% participation interests as of December 31, 2020. In total, during 2020, NSBF sold participations in $1.19 billion of PPP loans and continues to hold the PPP loan notes and the PPP loan documents in order to service the loans. The servicing liability in connection with the PPP loans was deemed immaterial. PPP loan origination fees are recognized as interest income on sale of PPP loan participations.\nThe decrease in interest income from SBA 7(a) loans was attributable to the decrease in the average Prime Rate in effect on our portfolio from 5.38% to 3.63% over the twelve month period. The decrease was partially offset by $451,000 of interest income relating to the full payoff of a loan in non-accrual status during the second quarter of 2020, as well as the average outstanding accrual portfolio of SBA non-affiliate investments increasing to $363,907,000 from $339,128,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the average outstanding accrual portfolio resulted from the origination of new SBA non-affiliate investments period over period.\nOrigination and Loan Processing\nDividend Income\nSecuritization Transactions\nRule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act was recently adopted by the SEC and establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are evaluating the impact of adopting Rule 2a-5 on the consolidated financial statements and intend to comply with the new rule's requirements on or before the compliance date in September 2022.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, the Company may base its valuation on quotes provided by an independent third party broker.\nThe decrease in dividend income was driven by dividend income related to our payment processing portfolio company, NMS, decreasing $2,040,000 period over period due to COVID-19 pandemic-related lower processing volumes. The decrease was offset by $1,600,000 of dividend income from NCL for year ended December 31, 2020, which stemmed from NCL's achievement of profitability in 2020 and positive net income for the year.\n(1) Realized gains greater than 110.00% must be split 50/50 with the SBA in accordance with SBA regulations. The realized gains recognized above reflects amounts net of split with the SBA.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, ( ASU 2020-08\u201d). This ASU clarifies that an entity should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of ASC paragraph 310-20-35-33 for each reporting period. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application is not permitted. All entities should apply ASU 2020-08 on a prospective basis as of the beginning of the period of adoption for existing or newly purchased callable debt securities. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements since the Company does not have any convertible debt.\nExpenses:\nNet realized gains from SBA non-affiliate investments for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $11,368,000 and $47,816,000, respectively, which included realized losses of $8,367,000 and $3,924,000, respectively.\nDistribution by Primary Collateral Type\n7(a) borrowers with loans approved from February 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, will receive 5 months of payments of principal, interest, and fees, capped at $9,000 per month. Beginning in January 2021, NSBF began offering PPP Second Draw Loans to eligible business. Eligibility for PPP Second Draw loans is limited to small businesses that have no more than 300 employees and demonstrate at least a 25 percent reduction in gross revenues between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020. PPP Second Draw loans have a maximum loan size of 2.5X average monthly payroll costs, up to $2 million. In addition, small businesses assigned to the industry NAICS code 72 (Accommodation and Food Services) can receive PPP Second Draw loans equal to 3.5X average monthly payroll costs in order to helps these businesses combat onerous State and local restrictions. Borrowers are eligible to receive full loan forgiveness if they spend at least 60 percent of their PPP Second Draw loan on payroll costs over a time period of their choosing between 8 weeks and 24 weeks. In addition, NSBF is also offering PPP loans (first draw loans) through March 31, 2021. For PPP loans made on or after December 27, 2020, SBA will pay lenders fees based on the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the loan, for processing PPP loans in the following amounts: (i) for loans of not more than $50,000, an amount equal to the lesser of fifty (50) percent or $2,500; (ii) five (5) percent for loans of more than $50,000 and not more than $350,000; (iii) three (3) percent for loans of more than $350,000 and less than $2,000,000; and (iv) one (1) percent for loans of at least $2,000,000.\nContractual Obligations\nThe 2017 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement provided that we may offer and sell up to 4,400,000 shares of common stock from time to time through the placement agents. From inception through July 8, 2019, we sold 1,618,375 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $18.07 per share. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $28,466,000. On July 8, 2019, the Company gave notice to terminate the 2017 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement, with such termination effective as of July 9, 2019.\nNet Realized Gains on SBA Non-Affiliate Investments\nOn March 22, 2018, the Company redeemed all $40,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from December 31, 2017, through, but excluding, the redemption date.\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nWe established a 50/50 joint venture between Newtek Commercial Lending, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newtek, and Conventional Lending TCP Holding, LLC, a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (Nasdaq:TCPC). NCL provides non-conforming conventional commercial and industrial term loans to U.S. middle-market companies and small businesses. Refer to NOTE 3-INVESTMENTS for selected financial information and a schedule of investments of NCL as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company accounts for servicing assets in accordance with ASC 860-50 Transfers and Servicing - Servicing Assets and Liabilities. Servicing assets are measured at fair value at each reporting date and the Company reports changes in the fair value of servicing assets in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. The valuation model for servicing assets incorporates assumptions including, but not limited to, servicing costs, discount rate, prepayment rate, and default rate. Considerable judgement is required to estimate the fair value of servicing assets and as such these assets are classified as Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy.\nThe following tables set forth distributions of the cost basis of the Company's SBA 7(a) loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, in thousands. The tables include loans in which NSBF owns 100% as a result of NSBF originating the loan and subsequently repurchasing the guaranteed portion from the SBA. The total of 100% NSBF-owned loans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is $16,931,000 and $11,307,000, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nNSBF Servicing Portfolio and Related Servicing Income\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived from our Capital One Facility, Notes payable - related parties, 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes, securitization transactions and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our borrowings and the proceeds from the turnover of our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. We may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off a shelf registration, including at-the-market\u201d, or ATM, and private offerings of securities. As of December 31, 2020, our asset coverage was 174% based on $457,931,000 of aggregate principal amount of senior securities outstanding. On July 26, 2018, our shareholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirement as set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, our minimum required asset coverage ratio decreased from 200% to 150%, effective July 27, 2018.\n\nOn February 23, 2021, the Company declared a first quarter 2021 cash dividend of $0.50 per share, which is payable on March 31, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 22, 2021.\nThe Company is a guarantor on the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility at NBC. Maximum borrowings under the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility are $35,000,000. The Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility matures in August 2022 and automatically renews annually. At December 31, 2020, total principal owed by NBC was $18,411,000. In addition, the Company deposited $750,000 to collateralize the guarantee. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nSet forth below is a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on March 16, 2020.\n\nRevenues\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes, but are consolidated for GAAP purposes, and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized a provision for deferred taxes of $999,000 and $3,164,000 related to the net unrealized appreciation of controlled portfolio company investments, respectively.\nDividend income is dependent on portfolio company earnings. Current year dividend income may not be indicative of future period dividend income, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. See COVID-19 Developments.\u201d\nNew Accounting Standards\nCash Flows and Liquidity\n\u2022our risk management policies and practices may be negatively impacted by among, other things, changes in the SBA 7(a) Program, including changes to SBA Loan Program Requirements;\nWe are continuing to assess what additional adverse financial and operational consequences may result from the global spread of COVID-19 and the associated economic turbulence, however, the extent of such consequences remains uncertain as of the filing of this Form 10-K as we do not believe there have been comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nDividend income was earned from the following portfolio companies for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nIntroduction and Certain Cautionary Statements\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and established the PPP. Specifically, the CARES Act included $349 billion to establish the PPP that expanded the existing SBA Section 7(a) loan program until June 30, 2020 to provide 100% federally-backed loans to eligible businesses. Subsequently, on April 3, 2020, the SBA, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Treasury (the Treasury\u201d), adopted the PPP interim final rule (the Regulations\u201d) to implement the PPP and effectuate the expansion of the Section 7(a) loan program. The Regulations established additional rules and requirements of the PPP, including loan forgiveness, and were amended from time to time to provide additional guidance and clarifications. Congress approved additional funding for the PPP of approximately $320 billion on April 24, 2020. As a result of the uncertain economic impact to U.S. small businesses created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's Executive Committee and Lending Team temporarily shifted the focus of NSBF from originating SBA 7(a) loans to originating PPP loans beginning in March 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NSBF funded approximately 10,500 PPP loans totaling $1.19 billion. On July 4, 2020, a bill was passed to re-open the application window for the PPP until August 8, 2020. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d We continue to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related to the PPP, but there can be no assurance that the PPP will be further reauthorized, or that NSBF will be qualified to participate in any further reauthorization.\nThe Company is a guarantor on the Webster Facility, a term loan facility between NMS with Webster Bank with an aggregate principal amount up to $50,000,000. The Webster Facility matures in November 2023. At December 31, 2020, total principal outstanding was $36,375,000. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2020, NCL had $568,000 of unfunded commitments in connection with partial funding of certain of its non-conforming conventional commercial and industrial term loan investments. NCL will fund 50% of the total unfunded commitments. NCL will fund these commitments from the same sources it uses to fund its other investment commitments.\nThe following table represents the NSBF originated servicing portfolio and servicing income earned for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAt December 31, 2020, there was $33,839,000 and $52,500,000 outstanding under the unguaranteed and guaranteed lines of credit, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we were in full compliance with all applicable loan covenants.\nIn November 2018, NSBF completed its ninth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $108,551,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2018-1 Trust. The 2018-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $108,551,000, consisting of $82,876,000 Class A notes and $25,675,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2044. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative index over which it has no direct control and which is readily verifiable, in accordance with the terms of the 2018-1 securitization transaction documents.\nDistribution by Days Delinquent\nrelated to an decrease in legal, prepayment and packaging fees earned as a result of the lower volume of SBA 7(a) loans originated of $196,752,000 compared to $517,692,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result of the uncertain economic impact to U.S. small businesses created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company temporarily shifted the focus of NSBF from originating SBA 7(a) loans to originating PPP loans beginning in March 2020 through the conclusion of round one of the PPP during 2020.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,( ASU 2020-04\u201d). ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts and transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective upon issuance of ASU 2020-04 for contract modifications on a prospective basis. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2020-04, the Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nFrom January 1, 2021 through March 26, 2021 the Company sold 430,470 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $20.93 per share under the 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $9,011,000. As of March 26, 2021, there were 1,546,951 shares of common stock available for sale under the 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement.\nPPP Additional Rounds\nNewtek Conventional Lending, LLC (NCL)\nWe typically structure our debt investments to include non-financial covenants that seek to minimize our risk of capital loss such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. Our debt investments have what we believe are strong protections, including default penalties, information rights and, in some cases, board observation rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Debt investments in portfolio companies, including the controlled portfolio companies, have historically and are expected to continue to comprise the majority of our overall investments in number and dollar volume.\nAs a BDC, our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily through loans originated by our business finance ecosystem and our equity investments in certain portfolio companies that we control.\nOur Board has the final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our determination of the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. We believe our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 approximates fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.\neconomics may continue to experience a recession, and we anticipate our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the U.S. and other major markets. Some economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a world-wide economic downturn.\nThe following table represents the Company's obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nNSBF, a nationally licensed SBA lender under the federal Section 7(a) loan program, has been granted PLP status and originates, sells and services SBA 7(a) loans and is authorized to place SBA guarantees on loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Being a national lender with PLP status allows NSBF to expedite the origination of loans since NSBF is not required to present applications to the SBA for concurrent review and approval. The loss of PLP status would adversely impact our marketing efforts and ultimately our loan origination volume which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company began earning interest income from PPP loans in the second quarter of 2020 under the CARES Act, which allowed NSBF, as an SBA 7(a) lender, to originate loans under the newly-established PPP. Under the PPP, current SBA 7(a) lenders were automatically approved to extend 100% federally guaranteed PPP loans to certain small businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NSBF originated $1.19 billion of PPP loans resulting in $37,743,000 of fees generated. Pursuant to the PPP, the interest rate on PPP loans is capped at 1.0%. In addition, the SBA will reimburse a lender authorized to make a PPP loan at a rate, based on the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the PPP loan, of: (i) 5% for PPP loans of not more than $350,000; (ii) 3% for loans of more than $350,000 and less than $2,000,000; and (iii) 1% for loans of not less than $2,000,000. Such SBA reimbursements are included in Interest Income - PPP Loans. Income earned in connection with the PPP should not be viewed as recurring. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. Congress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d\nSince 2010, NSBF has engaged in securitizations of the unguaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans. In the securitization, it uses a special purpose entity (the Trust\u201d) which is considered a variable interest entity. Applying the consolidation requirements for VIEs under the accounting rules in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, and ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which became effective January 1, 2010, the Company determined that as the primary beneficiary of the securitization vehicle, based on its power to direct activities through its role as servicer for the Trust and its obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits, it needed to consolidate the Trusts. NSBF therefore consolidated the entity using the carrying amounts of the Trust's assets and liabilities. NSBF reflects the assets in SBA Unguaranteed Non-Affiliate Investments and reflects the associated financing in Notes Payable - Securitization trusts on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nIn October 2019, NSBF completed its tenth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $118,920,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2019-1 Trust, The 2019-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $118,920,000, consisting of $93,540,000 of Class A notes and $25,380,000 Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is December 2044. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at an average rate of LIBOR plus 1.83% across both classes. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative in accordance with the terms of the 2019-1 securitization transaction documents.\nThe Company's investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nDistribution by Borrower Credit Score\n\n(1) Amounts represent principal only and are not shown net of unamortized debt issuance costs. See NOTE 8-BORROWINGS.\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and assets that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments or servicing assets, as appropriate, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest, dividend, servicing and other fee income on debt and equity investments. Our debt investments typically have terms of 10 to 25 years and bear interest at prime plus a margin. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA investments which we originate and sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of packaging, prepayment, legal and late fees. We record such fees related to loans as other income. Dividends are recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain. In addition, under the PPP that began in the second quarter of 2020, the SBA reimburses the Company for originating loans and such SBA reimbursements are included as interest income on PPP loans. Income earned in connection with the PPP should not be viewed as recurring. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. Congress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d\nATM Program\nWe target our debt investments, which are principally made through our business finance ecosystem under the SBA 7(a) program, to produce a coupon rate of prime plus 2.25% to 2.75% which enables us to generate rapid sales of guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. We typically structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral along with personal guarantees from portfolio company owners, in many cases collateralized by other assets including real estate. In most cases, our debt investment will be collateralized by a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company and a first or second lien on assets of guarantors, in both cases primarily real estate. All SBA loans are made with personal guarantees from any owner(s) of 20% or more of the portfolio company's equity. The amount of new debt investments, particularly SBA 7(a) loans that we originate, will directly impact future investment income. In addition, future amounts of unrealized appreciation or depreciation on our investments, as well as the amount of realized gains or losses, will also fluctuate depending upon economic conditions and the performance of our investment portfolio. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results.\nInvestment Income\nAs a result of the uncertain economic impact to U.S. small businesses created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's Executive Committee and Lending Team temporarily shifted the focus of NSBF from originating SBA 7(a) loans to originating PPP loans beginning in March 2020, resulting in a lower volume of SBA 7(a) loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019.\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Shortly thereafter, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency throughout the United States attributable to such outbreak. The outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States, including in the markets in which the Company operates. In accordance with guidance from various state and local governments, the majority of the Company's employees continue to work remotely, which has not impacted our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nOn February 16, 2021, the Company issued an additional $5,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 2024 Notes. The Notes are treated as a single series with the existing 2024 Notes and have the same terms as the 2024 Notes outstanding prior to February 16, 2021. The Notes will have the same CUSIP number and will be fungible and rank equally with the Existing Notes. Upon issuance of the Notes, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.75% Notes due 2024 increased to $68,250,000.\nWhile several countries, as well as certain states, counties and cities in the United States, have relaxed initial public health restrictions with a view to partially or fully reopening their economies, many cities world-wide have since experienced a surge in the reported number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases have led to the re-introduction of restrictions and business shutdowns in certain states, counties and cities in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions and business shutdowns elsewhere. Additionally, as of late December 2020, travelers from the United States were not allowed to visit Canada, Australia, or the majority of countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. These continued travel restrictions may prolong the global economic downturn. In addition, although the Federal Food and Drug Administration authorized vaccines for emergency use starting in December 2020, it remains unclear how quickly the vaccine will be distributed nationwide and globally or when herd immunity\u201d will be achieved and the restrictions that were imposed to slow the spread of the virus will be lifted entirely. The delay in distributing the vaccines could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and most other major global\nWe are a leading national non-bank lender and own and control certain portfolio companies under the Newtek\u00ae brand (our controlled portfolio companies,\u201d as defined below) that provide a wide range of business and financial solutions to SMBs. Newtek's and its portfolio companies' business and financial solutions include: Business Lending, including origination of SBA 7(a), SBA 504, and nonconforming (non SBA) conventional loans, as well as PPP loans in the second and third quarters of 2020, Electronic Payment Processing, Managed Technology Solutions (Cloud Computing), Technology Consulting, eCommerce, Accounts Receivable and Inventory Financing, personal and commercial Insurance Services, Web Services, Data Backup, Storage and Retrieval, and Payroll and Benefits Solutions to SMB accounts nationwide across all industries. We have an established and reliable platform that is not limited by client size, industry type, or location. As a result, we believe we have a strong and diversified client base across every state in the United States. and across a variety of different industries. In addition, we have developed a financial and technology based business model that enables us and our controlled portfolio companies to acquire and process our SMB clients in a very cost effective manner. This capability is supported in large part by NewTracker\u00ae, our patented prospect management technology software, which is similar to, but we believe better suited for our needs than, the system popularized by Salesforce.com. We believe that this technology and business model distinguishes us from our competitors.\nAs of the date of this filing, the PPP Extension Act of 2021 has been passed by Congress and the Senate and is pending signature by the President of the United States. The bill would extend the deadline to submit PPP applications from March 31, 2021 to May 31, 2021.\n\u2022increases in borrowers seeking and being granted deferments of principal and interest payments, which could negatively impact cash flow from net interest and servicing payments normally available to the Company, during the deferment period;\nOther Income\nCOVID-19 Developments\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\nIn addition, under the PPP that began in the second quarter of 2020, the SBA reimburses the Company for originating loans. Such SBA reimbursements are included as interest income on PPP loans. Such fees are accounted for under ASC-310 Receivables and deferred until the loan is sold to one of our PPP Participants. Income earned in connection with the PPP should not be viewed as recurring. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. Congress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which provides for, among other things, funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d\nIn October 2018, the 2013-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2013-1 Trust assets, with the 2013-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price. Certain of the 2013-1 Trust's assets were subsequently transferred to the 2018-1 Trust.\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board under our valuation policy and process. We may seek pricing information with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value such investments. We also employ independent third party valuation firms for certain of our investments for which there is not a readily available market value.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Controlled Investments\nExpenses\nAt December 31, 2020, the Related Party RLOC interest rate was 2.74%. The Related Party RLOC has a maturity date of November 8, 2023. Outstanding borrowings due to NMS at December 31, 2020 were $24,090,000.\nThe Base Indenture, and each supplemental indenture thereto, contains certain covenants including covenants requiring the Company to comply with (regardless of whether it is subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act (or any successor provisions), to comply with (regardless of whether it is subject to) the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act and to provide financial information to the holders of the Notes and the Trustee if the Company should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the Base Indenture, as supplemented by each supplemental indenture thereto. The Base Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare such Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Notes.\nManagement reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal or interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on management's designation of non-accrual status. Interest receivable is analyzed regularly and may be reserved against when deemed uncollectible. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nValuation of Investments\nOur primary operating expenses are salaries and benefits, interest expense, origination and servicing and other general and administrative costs, such as professional fees, marketing, referral fees, servicing costs and rent. Since we are an internally-managed BDC with no outside adviser or management company, the BDC incurs all the related costs to operate the Company.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 815), ( ASU 2019-12\u201d). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 also improves the consistent application of, and simplifies, GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The standard is effective for all entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption was permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2019-12 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nGuarantees\nDebt Offerings\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the 2015 tax year and operates in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. The RIC tax return includes Newtek Business Services Corp. and NSBF, a single member LLC disregarded for tax purposes. None of the Company's other subsidiaries are included in the RIC tax return. The Company will evaluate and record any deferred tax assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that are not included in the RIC tax return. In order to maintain its RIC tax treatment, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to any income that is distributed to its stockholders as dividends.\nOn November 27, 2020, the Company and Trustee entered into the Fifth Supplemental Indenture to the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, relating to the issuance, offer and sale of $5 million aggregate principal amount of its 2025 Notes. The offering was consummated pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") among the Company and an accredited investor. The Purchase Agreement provided for the 2025 Notes to be issued to the purchaser in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were approximately $4.8 million, after deducting structuring fees and estimated offering expenses, each payable by the Company. The 2025 Notes are the Company's direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company's other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company's future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2025 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company exercised its option to issue up to $10 million of additional 2025 Notes to the purchaser, and issued $10 million in additional 2025 Notes to the purchaser in an exempt offering in January 2021. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2016, the Company and the Trustee, entered into the Second Supplemental Indenture to the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, relating to the Company's issuance, offer and sale of $35,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Notes due 2021. The Company granted an overallotment option of up to $5,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes. The sale of the Notes generated proceeds of approximately $33,750,000, net of underwriter's fees and expenses. In May 2016, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase $5,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes for an additional $5,066,000 in net proceeds. The 2021 Notes are the Company's direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company's other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company's future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2021 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company's subsidiaries.\n(1) On January 1, 2021, IPM and SIDCO became subsidiaries of NTS and as a result, the year ended December 31, 2020 valuation of NTS and related unrealized appreciation represents that of the combined entity.\nIn November 2020, the SEC published Release No. IC-34084 Use of Derivatives by Registered Investment Companies and Business Development Companies and adopted rules amending Rule 18f-4 and Rule 6c-11. Under the newly adopted rules, BDCs that use derivatives will be subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, a derivatives risk management program and testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These new requirements will apply unless the BDC qualifies as a limited derivatives user,\u201d as defined under the adopted rules. Under the new rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Compliance is required by August 19, 2022. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nProvision for Deferred Taxes on Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\n\nThere were no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020.\nNet Realized Gains and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Company may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary methods for determining enterprise value include a discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA or revenue. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Company will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Company uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\n Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury, other U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain private equity investments, retained residual interests in securitizations, residential mortgage servicing rights, and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts. \nUnfunded Commitments\nIn December 2017, NSBF completed its eighth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $76,188,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2017-1 Trust. The 2017-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $75,426,000, consisting of $58,111,000 Class A notes and $17,315,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2043. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at a rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 2.0% and 3.0%, respectively. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative index over which it has no direct control and which is readily verifiable, in accordance with the terms of the 2017-1 securitization transaction documents.\nFor certain investments, the Company generally calculates the fair value of the investment primarily based on the NAV of the entity and adjusts the fair value for other factors that would affect the fair value of the investment. The Company uses this valuation approach for its investment in NCL.\n\u2022increases in loan delinquencies, losses and charge-offs;\n\u2022cyber risk has increased as criminals have sought to take advantage of the changes of business practices necessitated by COVID-19.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn August 29, 2019, the Company redeemed all $8,324,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes on the redemption date of August 29, 2019 at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from July 1, 2019, through, but excluding, the redemption date.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's unused sources of liquidity consisted of $2,765,000 available through the Capital One facility; $6,217,000 available through notes payable with related parties; and $2,073,000 in unrestricted cash.\nIssuance of Additional Notes due 2024\n\nThe Company is a guarantor on the NBL Facility. Maximum borrowings under the NBL Facility are $75,000,000 with an accordion feature to increase maximum borrowings to $150,000,000. The lenders' commitments terminate in November 2022, with all amounts due under the NBL Facility maturing in November 2023. At December 31, 2020, total principal owed by NBL was $44,216,000. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nUnrealized appreciation (depreciation) was derived from the following portfolio companies for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nThe 2024 Notes will mature on August 1, 2024 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company's option at any time or from time to time on or after August 1, 2021, at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to but not including the date fixed for redemption. The 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.75% per year payable quarterly on February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year, commencing on November 1, 2019, and trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol NEWTL.\u201d At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the 2024 Notes.\nRecent Developments\n\nAs such, we are unable to predict the duration of any business and supply-chain disruptions, the extent to which COVID-19 will negatively affect our and our portfolio companies' operating results or the impact that such disruptions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. Though the magnitude of the impact remains to be seen, we expect our portfolio companies to potentially be negatively impacted. We believe that certain negative impacts to our SBA 7(a) borrowers may have been muted, in part, due to provisions of the CARES Act that provided for six months of principal, interest and fees to be paid by the SBA directly to NSBF beginning in April 2020. With the end of the SBA's payment of principal, interest and fees on behalf of our SBA 7(a) borrowers, we may see increases in loan delinquencies and borrowers requesting loan deferments. A deferment is the postponement of scheduled loan payments of principal and/or interest to a later date. Generally, the amount deferred should not exceed six cumulative monthly payments or 20% of the original amount of loan, whichever is less. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced and may continue to experience a decline in SBA 7(a) loan originations and gains on sale from guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans.\nWe are an internally-managed, closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with our 2015 tax year. As a BDC and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. As a result, previously consolidated subsidiaries are now recorded as investments in controlled portfolio companies, at fair value. NSBF is a consolidated subsidiary and originates loans under the SBA's 7(a) loan program.\nValuation of Servicing Assets\nA transfer of financial assets must meet the sale criteria under the accounting rules in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, in order to be considered a sale instead of a secured borrowing. The Company determined that the sale criteria are met and the Participants' interests in the PPP loans are not held on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As stated in the PPP loan participation agreements, the intention of the parties is for the participation agreements to be absolute and true sales and not secured borrowings. In accordance with the terms of the PPP loan participation agreements and SBA regulations and guidance, NSBF, as the originating lender, retains all servicing rights and is the party responsible to the SBA with respect to all servicing actions, including requests for advance purchases and loan forgiveness, and will be the party eligible for the guarantee purchase of the PPP loan. For the 100% participations, the entire financial asset is considered to have been sold since a 100% ownership interest in the underlying asset's cash flows has been sold to a third party and only the servicing rights remain with NSBF. For the 90% participations, the transfers met all the conditions of a participating interest as defined by ASC 860 to potentially qualify for sale accounting including (i) there is a proportionate ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (ii) all cash flows are divided proportionately among the participants, (iii) the parties' rights are parri passu, and (iv) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire PPP loan unless all participating interest holders agree. The Company obtained true sale opinions and concluded that legal isolation is met under ASC 860-10-45-5a. As required under ASC 860 for sale accounting, the Company does not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets, except for standard representations and warranties, such as in the event of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct on the part of the Company, or failure to meet the ongoing contractual obligations to service the PPP loans. Owners of participations in PPP loans also have credit protection in the form of a 100% irrevocable government guarantee.\nRule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act was recently adopted by the SEC and establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are evaluating the impact of adopting Rule 2a-5 on the consolidated financial statements and intend to comply with the new rule's requirements on or before the compliance date in September 2022.\nIn November 2016, NSBF completed its seventh securitization which resulted in the transfer of $56,073,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2016-1 Trust. The 2016-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $53,444,000, consisting of $43,632,000 Class A notes and $9,812,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB+\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2042. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at an average rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 3.0% and 4.25%, respectively. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative index over which it has no direct control and which is readily verifiable, in accordance with the terms of the 2016-1 securitization transaction documents.\nThe Company generated and used cash as follows:\n\nIn July 2019, the Company and the Trustee entered into the Fourth Supplemental Indenture to the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, relating to the Company's issuance, offer and sale of $55,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Notes due 2024. The Company granted an overallotment option of up to $8,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes. The sale of the 2024 Notes generated proceeds of approximately $53,186,000, net of underwriter's fees and expenses. In July 2019 the underwriters exercised their option to purchase $8,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes for an additional $8,003,000 in net proceeds. The 2024 Notes are the Company's direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company's other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company's future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2024 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company's subsidiaries.\nPublic Offerings\n\u2022demand for our, and our portfolio companies', business products and solutions may decline, making it difficult to grow or maintain our assets and income;\nDividends are recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from a portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain.\nThese uses were offset by (i) $25,571,000 of net proceeds from the sale of common shares under the 2019 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement and 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement, (ii) $56,339,000 of net borrowings under our bank notes payable, and (iii) net borrowings under the Related Party RLOC of $11,927,000.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was enacted by Congress in order to provide additional assistance to the hardest-hit small businesses, nonprofits, and venues that are struggling to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Economic Aid Act provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021 and a second round of forgivable loans through the PPP for small businesses and nonprofits experiencing significant revenue losses, made programmatic improvements to PPP, funds grants to shuttered venues, and enacted emergency enhancements to other SBA lending programs. This assistance will provide small business owners with the capital they need to survive the pandemic and includes critical resources for the smallest businesses. The Economic Aid Act also provides additional subsidies to certain existing SBA 7(a) borrowers. Specifically, under the Economic Aid Act, the SBA will pay an additional three months of payments of principal, interest, and fees on existing performing SBA 7(a) loans approved prior to March 27, 2020, capped at $9,000 per borrower per month and new SBA\nWe used the net proceeds for funding investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with our investment objective and strategies and for general corporate purposes including funding investments, repaying outstanding indebtedness and other general corporate purposes.\nThe application of our valuation methods may include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments\nThe statements in this Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated future financial performance, business prospects, legislative developments and similar matters. We note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed in the forward-looking statements such as intensified competition and/or operating problems in our operating business projects and their impact on revenues and profit margins or additional factors as described under Risk Factors\u201d above.\nOther income relates primarily to legal, packaging, prepayment, and late fees earned from SBA 7(a) loans. The decrease was\nInterest Income\nWe regularly engage in discussions with third parties with respect to various potential transactions. We may acquire an investment or a portfolio of investments or an entire company or sell a portion of our portfolio on an opportunistic basis. We, our subsidiaries, or our affiliates may also agree to manage certain other funds that invest in debt, equity or provide other financing or services to companies in a variety of industries for which we may earn management or other fees for our services. We may also invest in the equity of these funds, along with other third parties, from which we would seek to earn a return and/or future incentive allocations. We may enter into new joint venture partnerships to create additional third-party capital to originate loans. Some of these transactions could be material to our business. Consummation of any such transaction will be subject to completion of due diligence, finalization of key business and financial terms (including price) and negotiation of final definitive documentation as well as a number of other factors and conditions including, without limitation, the approval of our board of directors and required regulatory or third-party consents and, in certain cases, the approval of our shareholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any such transaction would be consummated. Any of these transactions or funds may require significant management resources either during the transaction phase or on an ongoing basis depending on the terms of the transaction.\nInterest Expense\nOur common shares are currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol NEWT\u201d.\nDividends\nIn March 2019, the 2010-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2010-1 Trust assets, with the 2010-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price.\nWe consolidate the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nIssuance of Notes due 2026 and Redemption of Notes due 2023\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities provided cash of $17,763,000, consisting primarily of (i) $1,356,710,000 of proceeds from the sale of SBA 7(a) guaranteed loan investments, (ii) $61,976,000 of principal payments received from SBA non-affiliate investments and (iii) $19,221,000 in return of investment from controlled investments.\n\n\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company would then pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no U.S. federal excise taxes were due.\n\u2022net worth and liquidity of the guarantors on our loans may decline, which could cause loan losses to increase;\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nIn September 2015, the Company and the Trustee entered into the Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture relating to the Company's issuance, offer, and sale of $8,324,000, including the underwriter's partial exercise of their over-allotment option, in aggregate principal amount of the 7.5% Notes due 2022. The 2022 Notes are the Company's direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company's other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company's future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2022 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company's subsidiaries.\nIn July 2019, the 2014-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2014-1 Trust assets, with the 2014-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price.\nNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments relates to guaranteed portions of SBA debt investments made which the Company sells into a secondary market. Unrealized appreciation of SBA guaranteed investments represents the fair value adjustment of guaranteed portions of loans which have not yet been sold. Unrealized depreciation represents the reversal of unrealized appreciation when the SBA 7(a) loans are sold.\nWe receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA loan investments which we sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned and recorded daily. Servicing income is earned for the full term of the loan or until the loan is repaid.\nOn July 10, 2019, the Company entered into the 2019 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. The 2019 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement provided that the Company may offer and sell up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time through the placement agents. From inception through June 24, 2020, we sold 1,716,517 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $21.88 per share. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $37,554,000. On June 24, 2020, the Company terminated the 2019 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. The Company paid the ATM placement agents $758,000 in compensation.\nNotes Payable - Related Parties\nCommon Stock\nWe receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including packaging fees, legal fees, late fees and prepayment fees. All other income is recorded when earned.", "item_7_text": "The decrease in Origination and Loan Processing expenses was attributed to a decrease in SBA 7(a) loan fundings.\nThe Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns prior to fiscal year 2015 are generally closed, and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings.\n\nThe decrease in interest expense period over period is primarily related to the decrease from Notes payable - Securitization Trusts, Bank notes payable, and Notes payable - related parties. Interest on Notes payable - Securitization Trusts decreased as a result of declining interest rates and principal balances year over year. The decreases in interest expense from Bank notes payable and Notes payable - related parties were related to a decrease in the average outstanding balance and interest rates period over period. The decrease in interest expense related to our redemption of the 2022 Notes was offset by an additional $2,356,000 of interest from the issuance of $63,250,000 of 2024 Notes and $37,000 of interest from the issuance of $5,000,000 2025 Notes.\nIncome Taxes\nLoan Portfolio Asset Quality and Composition\nCapital One Facilities\nOn January 6, 2021 the Company completed an offering of $10 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.85% notes due 2025. The offering was consummated pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement dated November 27, 2020 among the Company and an accredited investor by a placement notice delivered to the purchaser prior to March 31, 2021. The purchase agreement provides for the Notes to be issued to the Purchaser in a private placement. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were approximately $9.7 million, after deducting structuring fees and estimated offering expenses, each payable by the Company. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to fund investments in debt and equity in accordance with its investment objectives and strategies. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company may, by mutual agreement of the parties, issue up to $15 million in aggregate principal amount of additional Notes by placement notice delivered to the Purchaser after March 31, 2021 and before November 30, 2022.\nRestricted cash of $49,352,000 as of December 31, 2020 is primarily held by NSBF. The majority, or $48,600,000 of restricted cash includes reserves in the event payments are insufficient to cover interest and/or principal with respect to securitizations and loan principal and interest collected which are due to loan participants.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company entered into the 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. The 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement provides that the Company may offer and sell up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time through the placement agents. From inception through December 31, 2020, we sold 1,022,579 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $17.95 per share. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $18,334,000. The company paid the placement agents $374,000 in compensation during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, there were 1,977,421 shares of common stock available for sale under the 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement.\nIn May 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-X including the significance tests in the significant subsidiary\u201d definition in Rule 1-02(w), Securities Act Rule 405, and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 to improve their application and to assist registrants in making more meaningful determinations of whether a subsidiary or an acquired or disposed business is significant. In addition, to address the unique attributes of investment companies and business development companies, the SEC updated the significance tests in Rule 1-02(w), Securities Act Rule 405, and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 by (i) revising the investment test to compare the registrant's investments in and advances to the acquired or disposed business to the registrant's aggregate worldwide market value if available; (ii) revising the income test by adding a revenue component; (iii) expanding the use of pro forma financial information in measuring significance; and (iv) conforming, to the extent applicable, the significance threshold and tests for disposed businesses to those used for acquired businesses. The amendment became effective January 1, 2021; however, voluntary compliance with the final amendments will be permitted in advance of the effective date. No significant changes to our significant subsidiaries are expected.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels for disclosure purposes. The Company carries all investments at fair value. Additionally, the Company carries its servicing assets at fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of the significant input to its valuation. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\nIn February 2018, the Company and the Trustee entered into the Third Supplemental Indenture to the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, relating to the Company's issuance, offer and sale of $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Notes due 2023. The Company granted an overallotment option of up to $7,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes. The sale of the Notes generated proceeds of approximately $47,901,000, net of underwriter's fees and expenses. In February 2018, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase $7,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes for an additional $7,275,000 in net proceeds. The 2023 Notes are the Company's direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company's other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company's future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2023 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company's subsidiaries.\n\nChanges in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Our investment portfolio is carried on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities at fair value with any adjustments to fair value recognized as \"Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\" on the consolidated statements of operations until the investment is realized, usually upon exit, resulting in any gain or loss being recognized as a \"Net realized gains (losses).\"\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had $3,263,000 of unfunded commitments in connection with its SBA 7(a) non-affiliate investments related to portions of loans originated which are partially funded. The Company will fund these commitments from the same sources it uses to fund its other investment commitments.\n\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nMoreover, COVID-19 has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact our operations and the operations of our borrowers, customers, portfolio companies and business partners. For example, as a result of the significant uncertainty due to COVID-19 we could experience declining values of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position, including possible constraints on liquidity and capital, as well as higher costs of capital. A number of factors impacting us or our portfolio companies, borrowers, customers or business partners could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, including but not limited to:\nThe increase in servicing income was attributable to the increase in total portfolio investments for which we earn servicing income. The portfolio earning servicing income increased $77,895,000 period over period. The increase was attributable to an increase in SBA 7(a) non-affiliate investments period over period.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $465,000 consisting primarily of (i) $54,885,000 of principal payments related to securitization notes payable and (ii) $42,583,000 of dividend payments.\nOn January 22, 2021, the Company closed a public offering of $115,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 2026 Notes, including $15,000,000 in aggregate principal amount sold pursuant to a fully-exercised overallotment option. The 2026 Notes will mature on February 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at Newtek's option on or after February 1, 2022. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year payable quarterly on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1, of each year, beginning May 1, 2021. Total net proceeds received after deducting underwriters' discount and expenses was $11,287,500. The 2026 Notes are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol NEWTZ.\u201d A portion of the proceeds were used to redeem the outstanding 2023 Notes, which occurred on February 22, 2021.\nExecutive Overview\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nDistribution by Business Type\nCongress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which, among other things, provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d We continue to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related to the PPP, but there can be no assurance that the PPP will be further reauthorized, or that NSBF will be qualified to participate in any further reauthorization.\n\u2022collateral for loans, including real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following is a summary of interest expense by facility for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nIssuance of Notes due 2025\nThe Company's Taxable Subsidiaries accrue income taxes payable based on the applicable corporate rates on the net unrealized appreciation generated by the controlled investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. Such deferred tax liabilities amounted to $11,406,000 and $12,405,000 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and are recorded as deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The change in deferred tax liabilities is included as a component of net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe have and continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our portfolio companies. We cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its duration in the United States and worldwide, the effectiveness of governmental responses designed to mitigate the strain to businesses and the economy, and the magnitude of the economic impact of the outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its spread have caused, and are continuing to cause, business shutdowns, cancellations of events and travel, significant reductions in demand for certain goods and services, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability both globally and in the United States. Such effects will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and for some period thereafter.\nThe 2023 Notes were scheduled to mature on March 1, 2023 and could be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company's option at any time or from time to time on or after March 1, 2020, at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to but not including the date fixed for redemption. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.25% per year payable quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2018, and trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol NEWTI.\u201d The Company redeemed the 2023 Notes in February 2021. See NOTE 19-SUBSEQUENT EVENTS in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nThese increases were offset by (i) $1,389,763,000 of SBA 7(a) and PPP loan investments funded and (ii) $51,437,000 of investments in controlled portfolio companies, including $4,957,000 in NCL and $40,285,000 in NBL.\nIncome Recognition\n\nIn May 2017, NSBF amended its Capital One facility to increase the facility from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000 and reduce the interest rate. The facility was amended again in June 2018 and the portion of the facility collateralized by the government guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime minus 0.75% (previously Prime minus 0.25%). The interest rate on the portion of the facility, collateralized by the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime plus 0.25% (previously Prime plus 0.75%). The facility provides for a 55% advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates, and a 90% advance rate on the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates. In addition, the amendment extended the date on which the facility will convert to a term loan from May 16, 2017 to May 11, 2020 and extended the maturity date of the facility to May 11, 2022. In June 2019, the facility was increased from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000. In April 2020, Capital One advised NSBF that it was establishing a reserve against the non-guaranteed borrowing base, which reserve effectively reduced the advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates by 50%. On May 7, 2020, NSBF amended its existing line of credit with Capital One to, among other things, extend the maturity date on which the credit facility will convert into a term loan for a period of three years to May 7, 2023, with the term loan maturing on May 7, 2025.\n\nIn June 2015, the Company entered into the Related Party RLOC with certain controlled portfolio companies. Maximum borrowings under the Related Party RLOC were $38,000,000. In June 2017, the Related Party RLOC was amended to increase maximum borrowings to $50,000,000. The outstanding balance had an interest rate equal to 1 month LIBOR (with a floor of 0.50%) plus 6.0% or at a rate equal to the greater of the Prime Rate or 3.5% plus 5.0%. In November 2018, the Related Party RLOC was amended to reduce the interest rate to the lesser of 1 month LIBOR plus 2.5% or the Prime Rate plus 1.5%.\nWhile the vast majority of our investments have been structured as debt, we have in the past and expect in the future to make selective equity investments primarily as either strategic investments to enhance the integrated operating platform or, to a lesser degree, under the Capco programs. For investments in our controlled portfolio companies, we focus more on tailoring them to the long term growth needs of the companies than to return. Our objectives with these companies is to foster the development of the businesses as a part of the integrated operational platform of serving the SMB market, so we may reduce the burden on these companies to enable them to grow faster than they would otherwise and as another means of supporting their development.\nPPP Loan Participations\nBeginning in April 2020, NSBF engaged in the origination of PPP loans. This first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. During the duration of the first round of PPP during 2020, NSBF funded approximately 10,570 PPP loans totaling $1.19 billion. To facilitate NSBF's involvement as a lender in the PPP, during the second quarter of 2020, NSBF entered into PPP loan participation agreements where NSBF originated PPP loans and sold 90% participating interests to UBS Bank USA ( UBS\u201d), Stifel Bank ( Stifel\u201d), Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. ( Morgan Stanley\u201d), and Amalgamated Bank ( Amalgamated\u201d), collectively, the Participants.\u201d The participations were sold at par due to the short term maturity of the loans. NSBF and the Participants share proportionally in all interest and principal payments made on the loans. Subsequently, UBS, Stifel and Amalgamated amended their participation agreements with NSBF to allow the banks purchase up to 100% participation interests in certain of the PPP loans originated by NSBF. In connection with the amendments, UBS, Stifel, and Amalgamated purchased the remaining 10% participation interests in their participation loans, bringing their participation interests to 100%, while Morgan Stanley continues to hold 90% participation interests as of December 31, 2020. In total, during 2020, NSBF sold participations in $1.19 billion of PPP loans and continues to hold the PPP loan notes and the PPP loan documents in order to service the loans. The servicing liability in connection with the PPP loans was deemed immaterial. PPP loan origination fees are recognized as interest income on sale of PPP loan participations.\nThe decrease in interest income from SBA 7(a) loans was attributable to the decrease in the average Prime Rate in effect on our portfolio from 5.38% to 3.63% over the twelve month period. The decrease was partially offset by $451,000 of interest income relating to the full payoff of a loan in non-accrual status during the second quarter of 2020, as well as the average outstanding accrual portfolio of SBA non-affiliate investments increasing to $363,907,000 from $339,128,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the average outstanding accrual portfolio resulted from the origination of new SBA non-affiliate investments period over period.\nOrigination and Loan Processing\nDividend Income\nSecuritization Transactions\nRule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act was recently adopted by the SEC and establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are evaluating the impact of adopting Rule 2a-5 on the consolidated financial statements and intend to comply with the new rule's requirements on or before the compliance date in September 2022.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, the Company may base its valuation on quotes provided by an independent third party broker.\nThe decrease in dividend income was driven by dividend income related to our payment processing portfolio company, NMS, decreasing $2,040,000 period over period due to COVID-19 pandemic-related lower processing volumes. The decrease was offset by $1,600,000 of dividend income from NCL for year ended December 31, 2020, which stemmed from NCL's achievement of profitability in 2020 and positive net income for the year.\n(1) Realized gains greater than 110.00% must be split 50/50 with the SBA in accordance with SBA regulations. The realized gains recognized above reflects amounts net of split with the SBA.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, ( ASU 2020-08\u201d). This ASU clarifies that an entity should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of ASC paragraph 310-20-35-33 for each reporting period. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application is not permitted. All entities should apply ASU 2020-08 on a prospective basis as of the beginning of the period of adoption for existing or newly purchased callable debt securities. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements since the Company does not have any convertible debt.\nExpenses:\nNet realized gains from SBA non-affiliate investments for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $11,368,000 and $47,816,000, respectively, which included realized losses of $8,367,000 and $3,924,000, respectively.\nDistribution by Primary Collateral Type\n7(a) borrowers with loans approved from February 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, will receive 5 months of payments of principal, interest, and fees, capped at $9,000 per month. Beginning in January 2021, NSBF began offering PPP Second Draw Loans to eligible business. Eligibility for PPP Second Draw loans is limited to small businesses that have no more than 300 employees and demonstrate at least a 25 percent reduction in gross revenues between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020. PPP Second Draw loans have a maximum loan size of 2.5X average monthly payroll costs, up to $2 million. In addition, small businesses assigned to the industry NAICS code 72 (Accommodation and Food Services) can receive PPP Second Draw loans equal to 3.5X average monthly payroll costs in order to helps these businesses combat onerous State and local restrictions. Borrowers are eligible to receive full loan forgiveness if they spend at least 60 percent of their PPP Second Draw loan on payroll costs over a time period of their choosing between 8 weeks and 24 weeks. In addition, NSBF is also offering PPP loans (first draw loans) through March 31, 2021. For PPP loans made on or after December 27, 2020, SBA will pay lenders fees based on the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the loan, for processing PPP loans in the following amounts: (i) for loans of not more than $50,000, an amount equal to the lesser of fifty (50) percent or $2,500; (ii) five (5) percent for loans of more than $50,000 and not more than $350,000; (iii) three (3) percent for loans of more than $350,000 and less than $2,000,000; and (iv) one (1) percent for loans of at least $2,000,000.\nContractual Obligations\nThe 2017 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement provided that we may offer and sell up to 4,400,000 shares of common stock from time to time through the placement agents. From inception through July 8, 2019, we sold 1,618,375 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $18.07 per share. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $28,466,000. On July 8, 2019, the Company gave notice to terminate the 2017 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement, with such termination effective as of July 9, 2019.\nNet Realized Gains on SBA Non-Affiliate Investments\nOn March 22, 2018, the Company redeemed all $40,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from December 31, 2017, through, but excluding, the redemption date.\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nWe established a 50/50 joint venture between Newtek Commercial Lending, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newtek, and Conventional Lending TCP Holding, LLC, a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (Nasdaq:TCPC). NCL provides non-conforming conventional commercial and industrial term loans to U.S. middle-market companies and small businesses. Refer to NOTE 3-INVESTMENTS for selected financial information and a schedule of investments of NCL as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company accounts for servicing assets in accordance with ASC 860-50 Transfers and Servicing - Servicing Assets and Liabilities. Servicing assets are measured at fair value at each reporting date and the Company reports changes in the fair value of servicing assets in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. The valuation model for servicing assets incorporates assumptions including, but not limited to, servicing costs, discount rate, prepayment rate, and default rate. Considerable judgement is required to estimate the fair value of servicing assets and as such these assets are classified as Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy.\nThe following tables set forth distributions of the cost basis of the Company's SBA 7(a) loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, in thousands. The tables include loans in which NSBF owns 100% as a result of NSBF originating the loan and subsequently repurchasing the guaranteed portion from the SBA. The total of 100% NSBF-owned loans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is $16,931,000 and $11,307,000, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nNSBF Servicing Portfolio and Related Servicing Income\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived from our Capital One Facility, Notes payable - related parties, 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes, securitization transactions and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our borrowings and the proceeds from the turnover of our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. We may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off a shelf registration, including at-the-market\u201d, or ATM, and private offerings of securities. As of December 31, 2020, our asset coverage was 174% based on $457,931,000 of aggregate principal amount of senior securities outstanding. On July 26, 2018, our shareholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirement as set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, our minimum required asset coverage ratio decreased from 200% to 150%, effective July 27, 2018.\n\nOn February 23, 2021, the Company declared a first quarter 2021 cash dividend of $0.50 per share, which is payable on March 31, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 22, 2021.\nThe Company is a guarantor on the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility at NBC. Maximum borrowings under the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility are $35,000,000. The Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility matures in August 2022 and automatically renews annually. At December 31, 2020, total principal owed by NBC was $18,411,000. In addition, the Company deposited $750,000 to collateralize the guarantee. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nSet forth below is a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on March 16, 2020.\n\nRevenues\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes, but are consolidated for GAAP purposes, and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized a provision for deferred taxes of $999,000 and $3,164,000 related to the net unrealized appreciation of controlled portfolio company investments, respectively.\nDividend income is dependent on portfolio company earnings. Current year dividend income may not be indicative of future period dividend income, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. See COVID-19 Developments.\u201d\nNew Accounting Standards\nCash Flows and Liquidity\n\u2022our risk management policies and practices may be negatively impacted by among, other things, changes in the SBA 7(a) Program, including changes to SBA Loan Program Requirements;\nWe are continuing to assess what additional adverse financial and operational consequences may result from the global spread of COVID-19 and the associated economic turbulence, however, the extent of such consequences remains uncertain as of the filing of this Form 10-K as we do not believe there have been comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nDividend income was earned from the following portfolio companies for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nIntroduction and Certain Cautionary Statements\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and established the PPP. Specifically, the CARES Act included $349 billion to establish the PPP that expanded the existing SBA Section 7(a) loan program until June 30, 2020 to provide 100% federally-backed loans to eligible businesses. Subsequently, on April 3, 2020, the SBA, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Treasury (the Treasury\u201d), adopted the PPP interim final rule (the Regulations\u201d) to implement the PPP and effectuate the expansion of the Section 7(a) loan program. The Regulations established additional rules and requirements of the PPP, including loan forgiveness, and were amended from time to time to provide additional guidance and clarifications. Congress approved additional funding for the PPP of approximately $320 billion on April 24, 2020. As a result of the uncertain economic impact to U.S. small businesses created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's Executive Committee and Lending Team temporarily shifted the focus of NSBF from originating SBA 7(a) loans to originating PPP loans beginning in March 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NSBF funded approximately 10,500 PPP loans totaling $1.19 billion. On July 4, 2020, a bill was passed to re-open the application window for the PPP until August 8, 2020. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d We continue to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related to the PPP, but there can be no assurance that the PPP will be further reauthorized, or that NSBF will be qualified to participate in any further reauthorization.\nThe Company is a guarantor on the Webster Facility, a term loan facility between NMS with Webster Bank with an aggregate principal amount up to $50,000,000. The Webster Facility matures in November 2023. At December 31, 2020, total principal outstanding was $36,375,000. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2020, NCL had $568,000 of unfunded commitments in connection with partial funding of certain of its non-conforming conventional commercial and industrial term loan investments. NCL will fund 50% of the total unfunded commitments. NCL will fund these commitments from the same sources it uses to fund its other investment commitments.\nThe following table represents the NSBF originated servicing portfolio and servicing income earned for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAt December 31, 2020, there was $33,839,000 and $52,500,000 outstanding under the unguaranteed and guaranteed lines of credit, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we were in full compliance with all applicable loan covenants.\nIn November 2018, NSBF completed its ninth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $108,551,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2018-1 Trust. The 2018-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $108,551,000, consisting of $82,876,000 Class A notes and $25,675,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2044. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative index over which it has no direct control and which is readily verifiable, in accordance with the terms of the 2018-1 securitization transaction documents.\nDistribution by Days Delinquent\nrelated to an decrease in legal, prepayment and packaging fees earned as a result of the lower volume of SBA 7(a) loans originated of $196,752,000 compared to $517,692,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result of the uncertain economic impact to U.S. small businesses created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company temporarily shifted the focus of NSBF from originating SBA 7(a) loans to originating PPP loans beginning in March 2020 through the conclusion of round one of the PPP during 2020.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,( ASU 2020-04\u201d). ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts and transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective upon issuance of ASU 2020-04 for contract modifications on a prospective basis. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2020-04, the Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nFrom January 1, 2021 through March 26, 2021 the Company sold 430,470 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $20.93 per share under the 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $9,011,000. As of March 26, 2021, there were 1,546,951 shares of common stock available for sale under the 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement.\nPPP Additional Rounds\nNewtek Conventional Lending, LLC (NCL)\nWe typically structure our debt investments to include non-financial covenants that seek to minimize our risk of capital loss such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. Our debt investments have what we believe are strong protections, including default penalties, information rights and, in some cases, board observation rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Debt investments in portfolio companies, including the controlled portfolio companies, have historically and are expected to continue to comprise the majority of our overall investments in number and dollar volume.\nAs a BDC, our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily through loans originated by our business finance ecosystem and our equity investments in certain portfolio companies that we control.\nOur Board has the final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our determination of the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. We believe our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 approximates fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.\neconomics may continue to experience a recession, and we anticipate our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the U.S. and other major markets. Some economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a world-wide economic downturn.\nThe following table represents the Company's obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nNSBF, a nationally licensed SBA lender under the federal Section 7(a) loan program, has been granted PLP status and originates, sells and services SBA 7(a) loans and is authorized to place SBA guarantees on loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Being a national lender with PLP status allows NSBF to expedite the origination of loans since NSBF is not required to present applications to the SBA for concurrent review and approval. The loss of PLP status would adversely impact our marketing efforts and ultimately our loan origination volume which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company began earning interest income from PPP loans in the second quarter of 2020 under the CARES Act, which allowed NSBF, as an SBA 7(a) lender, to originate loans under the newly-established PPP. Under the PPP, current SBA 7(a) lenders were automatically approved to extend 100% federally guaranteed PPP loans to certain small businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NSBF originated $1.19 billion of PPP loans resulting in $37,743,000 of fees generated. Pursuant to the PPP, the interest rate on PPP loans is capped at 1.0%. In addition, the SBA will reimburse a lender authorized to make a PPP loan at a rate, based on the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the PPP loan, of: (i) 5% for PPP loans of not more than $350,000; (ii) 3% for loans of more than $350,000 and less than $2,000,000; and (iii) 1% for loans of not less than $2,000,000. Such SBA reimbursements are included in Interest Income - PPP Loans. Income earned in connection with the PPP should not be viewed as recurring. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. Congress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d\nSince 2010, NSBF has engaged in securitizations of the unguaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans. In the securitization, it uses a special purpose entity (the Trust\u201d) which is considered a variable interest entity. Applying the consolidation requirements for VIEs under the accounting rules in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, and ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which became effective January 1, 2010, the Company determined that as the primary beneficiary of the securitization vehicle, based on its power to direct activities through its role as servicer for the Trust and its obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits, it needed to consolidate the Trusts. NSBF therefore consolidated the entity using the carrying amounts of the Trust's assets and liabilities. NSBF reflects the assets in SBA Unguaranteed Non-Affiliate Investments and reflects the associated financing in Notes Payable - Securitization trusts on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nIn October 2019, NSBF completed its tenth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $118,920,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2019-1 Trust, The 2019-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $118,920,000, consisting of $93,540,000 of Class A notes and $25,380,000 Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is December 2044. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at an average rate of LIBOR plus 1.83% across both classes. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative in accordance with the terms of the 2019-1 securitization transaction documents.\nThe Company's investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nDistribution by Borrower Credit Score\n\n(1) Amounts represent principal only and are not shown net of unamortized debt issuance costs. See NOTE 8-BORROWINGS.\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and assets that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments or servicing assets, as appropriate, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest, dividend, servicing and other fee income on debt and equity investments. Our debt investments typically have terms of 10 to 25 years and bear interest at prime plus a margin. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA investments which we originate and sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of packaging, prepayment, legal and late fees. We record such fees related to loans as other income. Dividends are recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain. In addition, under the PPP that began in the second quarter of 2020, the SBA reimburses the Company for originating loans and such SBA reimbursements are included as interest income on PPP loans. Income earned in connection with the PPP should not be viewed as recurring. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. Congress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d\nATM Program\nWe target our debt investments, which are principally made through our business finance ecosystem under the SBA 7(a) program, to produce a coupon rate of prime plus 2.25% to 2.75% which enables us to generate rapid sales of guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. We typically structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral along with personal guarantees from portfolio company owners, in many cases collateralized by other assets including real estate. In most cases, our debt investment will be collateralized by a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company and a first or second lien on assets of guarantors, in both cases primarily real estate. All SBA loans are made with personal guarantees from any owner(s) of 20% or more of the portfolio company's equity. The amount of new debt investments, particularly SBA 7(a) loans that we originate, will directly impact future investment income. In addition, future amounts of unrealized appreciation or depreciation on our investments, as well as the amount of realized gains or losses, will also fluctuate depending upon economic conditions and the performance of our investment portfolio. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results.\nInvestment Income\nAs a result of the uncertain economic impact to U.S. small businesses created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's Executive Committee and Lending Team temporarily shifted the focus of NSBF from originating SBA 7(a) loans to originating PPP loans beginning in March 2020, resulting in a lower volume of SBA 7(a) loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019.\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Shortly thereafter, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency throughout the United States attributable to such outbreak. The outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States, including in the markets in which the Company operates. In accordance with guidance from various state and local governments, the majority of the Company's employees continue to work remotely, which has not impacted our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nOn February 16, 2021, the Company issued an additional $5,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 2024 Notes. The Notes are treated as a single series with the existing 2024 Notes and have the same terms as the 2024 Notes outstanding prior to February 16, 2021. The Notes will have the same CUSIP number and will be fungible and rank equally with the Existing Notes. Upon issuance of the Notes, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.75% Notes due 2024 increased to $68,250,000.\nWhile several countries, as well as certain states, counties and cities in the United States, have relaxed initial public health restrictions with a view to partially or fully reopening their economies, many cities world-wide have since experienced a surge in the reported number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases have led to the re-introduction of restrictions and business shutdowns in certain states, counties and cities in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions and business shutdowns elsewhere. Additionally, as of late December 2020, travelers from the United States were not allowed to visit Canada, Australia, or the majority of countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. These continued travel restrictions may prolong the global economic downturn. In addition, although the Federal Food and Drug Administration authorized vaccines for emergency use starting in December 2020, it remains unclear how quickly the vaccine will be distributed nationwide and globally or when herd immunity\u201d will be achieved and the restrictions that were imposed to slow the spread of the virus will be lifted entirely. The delay in distributing the vaccines could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and most other major global\nWe are a leading national non-bank lender and own and control certain portfolio companies under the Newtek\u00ae brand (our controlled portfolio companies,\u201d as defined below) that provide a wide range of business and financial solutions to SMBs. Newtek's and its portfolio companies' business and financial solutions include: Business Lending, including origination of SBA 7(a), SBA 504, and nonconforming (non SBA) conventional loans, as well as PPP loans in the second and third quarters of 2020, Electronic Payment Processing, Managed Technology Solutions (Cloud Computing), Technology Consulting, eCommerce, Accounts Receivable and Inventory Financing, personal and commercial Insurance Services, Web Services, Data Backup, Storage and Retrieval, and Payroll and Benefits Solutions to SMB accounts nationwide across all industries. We have an established and reliable platform that is not limited by client size, industry type, or location. As a result, we believe we have a strong and diversified client base across every state in the United States. and across a variety of different industries. In addition, we have developed a financial and technology based business model that enables us and our controlled portfolio companies to acquire and process our SMB clients in a very cost effective manner. This capability is supported in large part by NewTracker\u00ae, our patented prospect management technology software, which is similar to, but we believe better suited for our needs than, the system popularized by Salesforce.com. We believe that this technology and business model distinguishes us from our competitors.\nAs of the date of this filing, the PPP Extension Act of 2021 has been passed by Congress and the Senate and is pending signature by the President of the United States. The bill would extend the deadline to submit PPP applications from March 31, 2021 to May 31, 2021.\n\u2022increases in borrowers seeking and being granted deferments of principal and interest payments, which could negatively impact cash flow from net interest and servicing payments normally available to the Company, during the deferment period;\nOther Income\nCOVID-19 Developments\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\nIn addition, under the PPP that began in the second quarter of 2020, the SBA reimburses the Company for originating loans. Such SBA reimbursements are included as interest income on PPP loans. Such fees are accounted for under ASC-310 Receivables and deferred until the loan is sold to one of our PPP Participants. Income earned in connection with the PPP should not be viewed as recurring. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. Congress enacted the Economic Aid Act on December 27, 2020, which provides for, among other things, funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021. See Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.\u201d\nIn October 2018, the 2013-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2013-1 Trust assets, with the 2013-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price. Certain of the 2013-1 Trust's assets were subsequently transferred to the 2018-1 Trust.\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board under our valuation policy and process. We may seek pricing information with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value such investments. We also employ independent third party valuation firms for certain of our investments for which there is not a readily available market value.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Controlled Investments\nExpenses\nAt December 31, 2020, the Related Party RLOC interest rate was 2.74%. The Related Party RLOC has a maturity date of November 8, 2023. Outstanding borrowings due to NMS at December 31, 2020 were $24,090,000.\nThe Base Indenture, and each supplemental indenture thereto, contains certain covenants including covenants requiring the Company to comply with (regardless of whether it is subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act (or any successor provisions), to comply with (regardless of whether it is subject to) the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act and to provide financial information to the holders of the Notes and the Trustee if the Company should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the Base Indenture, as supplemented by each supplemental indenture thereto. The Base Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare such Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Notes.\nManagement reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal or interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on management's designation of non-accrual status. Interest receivable is analyzed regularly and may be reserved against when deemed uncollectible. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nValuation of Investments\nOur primary operating expenses are salaries and benefits, interest expense, origination and servicing and other general and administrative costs, such as professional fees, marketing, referral fees, servicing costs and rent. Since we are an internally-managed BDC with no outside adviser or management company, the BDC incurs all the related costs to operate the Company.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 815), ( ASU 2019-12\u201d). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 also improves the consistent application of, and simplifies, GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The standard is effective for all entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption was permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2019-12 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nGuarantees\nDebt Offerings\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the 2015 tax year and operates in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. The RIC tax return includes Newtek Business Services Corp. and NSBF, a single member LLC disregarded for tax purposes. None of the Company's other subsidiaries are included in the RIC tax return. The Company will evaluate and record any deferred tax assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that are not included in the RIC tax return. In order to maintain its RIC tax treatment, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to any income that is distributed to its stockholders as dividends.\nOn November 27, 2020, the Company and Trustee entered into the Fifth Supplemental Indenture to the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, relating to the issuance, offer and sale of $5 million aggregate principal amount of its 2025 Notes. The offering was consummated pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") among the Company and an accredited investor. The Purchase Agreement provided for the 2025 Notes to be issued to the purchaser in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were approximately $4.8 million, after deducting structuring fees and estimated offering expenses, each payable by the Company. The 2025 Notes are the Company's direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company's other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company's future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2025 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company exercised its option to issue up to $10 million of additional 2025 Notes to the purchaser, and issued $10 million in additional 2025 Notes to the purchaser in an exempt offering in January 2021. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2016, the Company and the Trustee, entered into the Second Supplemental Indenture to the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, relating to the Company's issuance, offer and sale of $35,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Notes due 2021. The Company granted an overallotment option of up to $5,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes. The sale of the Notes generated proceeds of approximately $33,750,000, net of underwriter's fees and expenses. In May 2016, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase $5,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes for an additional $5,066,000 in net proceeds. The 2021 Notes are the Company's direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company's other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company's future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2021 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company's subsidiaries.\n(1) On January 1, 2021, IPM and SIDCO became subsidiaries of NTS and as a result, the year ended December 31, 2020 valuation of NTS and related unrealized appreciation represents that of the combined entity.\nIn November 2020, the SEC published Release No. IC-34084 Use of Derivatives by Registered Investment Companies and Business Development Companies and adopted rules amending Rule 18f-4 and Rule 6c-11. Under the newly adopted rules, BDCs that use derivatives will be subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, a derivatives risk management program and testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These new requirements will apply unless the BDC qualifies as a limited derivatives user,\u201d as defined under the adopted rules. Under the new rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Compliance is required by August 19, 2022. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nProvision for Deferred Taxes on Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\n\nThere were no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020.\nNet Realized Gains and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Company may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary methods for determining enterprise value include a discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA or revenue. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Company will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Company uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\n Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury, other U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain private equity investments, retained residual interests in securitizations, residential mortgage servicing rights, and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts. \nUnfunded Commitments\nIn December 2017, NSBF completed its eighth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $76,188,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2017-1 Trust. The 2017-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $75,426,000, consisting of $58,111,000 Class A notes and $17,315,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2043. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at a rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 2.0% and 3.0%, respectively. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative index over which it has no direct control and which is readily verifiable, in accordance with the terms of the 2017-1 securitization transaction documents.\nFor certain investments, the Company generally calculates the fair value of the investment primarily based on the NAV of the entity and adjusts the fair value for other factors that would affect the fair value of the investment. The Company uses this valuation approach for its investment in NCL.\n\u2022increases in loan delinquencies, losses and charge-offs;\n\u2022cyber risk has increased as criminals have sought to take advantage of the changes of business practices necessitated by COVID-19.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn August 29, 2019, the Company redeemed all $8,324,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes on the redemption date of August 29, 2019 at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from July 1, 2019, through, but excluding, the redemption date.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's unused sources of liquidity consisted of $2,765,000 available through the Capital One facility; $6,217,000 available through notes payable with related parties; and $2,073,000 in unrestricted cash.\nIssuance of Additional Notes due 2024\n\nThe Company is a guarantor on the NBL Facility. Maximum borrowings under the NBL Facility are $75,000,000 with an accordion feature to increase maximum borrowings to $150,000,000. The lenders' commitments terminate in November 2022, with all amounts due under the NBL Facility maturing in November 2023. At December 31, 2020, total principal owed by NBL was $44,216,000. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nUnrealized appreciation (depreciation) was derived from the following portfolio companies for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nThe 2024 Notes will mature on August 1, 2024 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company's option at any time or from time to time on or after August 1, 2021, at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to but not including the date fixed for redemption. The 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.75% per year payable quarterly on February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year, commencing on November 1, 2019, and trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol NEWTL.\u201d At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the 2024 Notes.\nRecent Developments\n\nAs such, we are unable to predict the duration of any business and supply-chain disruptions, the extent to which COVID-19 will negatively affect our and our portfolio companies' operating results or the impact that such disruptions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. Though the magnitude of the impact remains to be seen, we expect our portfolio companies to potentially be negatively impacted. We believe that certain negative impacts to our SBA 7(a) borrowers may have been muted, in part, due to provisions of the CARES Act that provided for six months of principal, interest and fees to be paid by the SBA directly to NSBF beginning in April 2020. With the end of the SBA's payment of principal, interest and fees on behalf of our SBA 7(a) borrowers, we may see increases in loan delinquencies and borrowers requesting loan deferments. A deferment is the postponement of scheduled loan payments of principal and/or interest to a later date. Generally, the amount deferred should not exceed six cumulative monthly payments or 20% of the original amount of loan, whichever is less. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced and may continue to experience a decline in SBA 7(a) loan originations and gains on sale from guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans.\nWe are an internally-managed, closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with our 2015 tax year. As a BDC and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. As a result, previously consolidated subsidiaries are now recorded as investments in controlled portfolio companies, at fair value. NSBF is a consolidated subsidiary and originates loans under the SBA's 7(a) loan program.\nValuation of Servicing Assets\nA transfer of financial assets must meet the sale criteria under the accounting rules in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, in order to be considered a sale instead of a secured borrowing. The Company determined that the sale criteria are met and the Participants' interests in the PPP loans are not held on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As stated in the PPP loan participation agreements, the intention of the parties is for the participation agreements to be absolute and true sales and not secured borrowings. In accordance with the terms of the PPP loan participation agreements and SBA regulations and guidance, NSBF, as the originating lender, retains all servicing rights and is the party responsible to the SBA with respect to all servicing actions, including requests for advance purchases and loan forgiveness, and will be the party eligible for the guarantee purchase of the PPP loan. For the 100% participations, the entire financial asset is considered to have been sold since a 100% ownership interest in the underlying asset's cash flows has been sold to a third party and only the servicing rights remain with NSBF. For the 90% participations, the transfers met all the conditions of a participating interest as defined by ASC 860 to potentially qualify for sale accounting including (i) there is a proportionate ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (ii) all cash flows are divided proportionately among the participants, (iii) the parties' rights are parri passu, and (iv) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire PPP loan unless all participating interest holders agree. The Company obtained true sale opinions and concluded that legal isolation is met under ASC 860-10-45-5a. As required under ASC 860 for sale accounting, the Company does not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets, except for standard representations and warranties, such as in the event of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct on the part of the Company, or failure to meet the ongoing contractual obligations to service the PPP loans. Owners of participations in PPP loans also have credit protection in the form of a 100% irrevocable government guarantee.\nRule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act was recently adopted by the SEC and establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are evaluating the impact of adopting Rule 2a-5 on the consolidated financial statements and intend to comply with the new rule's requirements on or before the compliance date in September 2022.\nIn November 2016, NSBF completed its seventh securitization which resulted in the transfer of $56,073,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2016-1 Trust. The 2016-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $53,444,000, consisting of $43,632,000 Class A notes and $9,812,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB+\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2042. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at an average rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 3.0% and 4.25%, respectively. Generally, in the event that the one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate becomes unavailable or otherwise unpublished, NSBF will select as a replacement a comparable alternative index over which it has no direct control and which is readily verifiable, in accordance with the terms of the 2016-1 securitization transaction documents.\nThe Company generated and used cash as follows:\n\nIn July 2019, the Company and the Trustee entered into the Fourth Supplemental Indenture to the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, relating to the Company's issuance, offer and sale of $55,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Notes due 2024. The Company granted an overallotment option of up to $8,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes. The sale of the 2024 Notes generated proceeds of approximately $53,186,000, net of underwriter's fees and expenses. In July 2019 the underwriters exercised their option to purchase $8,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes for an additional $8,003,000 in net proceeds. The 2024 Notes are the Company's direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company's other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company's future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2024 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company's subsidiaries.\nPublic Offerings\n\u2022demand for our, and our portfolio companies', business products and solutions may decline, making it difficult to grow or maintain our assets and income;\nDividends are recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from a portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain.\nThese uses were offset by (i) $25,571,000 of net proceeds from the sale of common shares under the 2019 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement and 2020 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement, (ii) $56,339,000 of net borrowings under our bank notes payable, and (iii) net borrowings under the Related Party RLOC of $11,927,000.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was enacted by Congress in order to provide additional assistance to the hardest-hit small businesses, nonprofits, and venues that are struggling to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Economic Aid Act provides funding for PPP loans through March 31, 2021 and a second round of forgivable loans through the PPP for small businesses and nonprofits experiencing significant revenue losses, made programmatic improvements to PPP, funds grants to shuttered venues, and enacted emergency enhancements to other SBA lending programs. This assistance will provide small business owners with the capital they need to survive the pandemic and includes critical resources for the smallest businesses. The Economic Aid Act also provides additional subsidies to certain existing SBA 7(a) borrowers. Specifically, under the Economic Aid Act, the SBA will pay an additional three months of payments of principal, interest, and fees on existing performing SBA 7(a) loans approved prior to March 27, 2020, capped at $9,000 per borrower per month and new SBA\nWe used the net proceeds for funding investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with our investment objective and strategies and for general corporate purposes including funding investments, repaying outstanding indebtedness and other general corporate purposes.\nThe application of our valuation methods may include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments\nThe statements in this Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated future financial performance, business prospects, legislative developments and similar matters. We note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed in the forward-looking statements such as intensified competition and/or operating problems in our operating business projects and their impact on revenues and profit margins or additional factors as described under Risk Factors\u201d above.\nOther income relates primarily to legal, packaging, prepayment, and late fees earned from SBA 7(a) loans. The decrease was\nInterest Income\nWe regularly engage in discussions with third parties with respect to various potential transactions. We may acquire an investment or a portfolio of investments or an entire company or sell a portion of our portfolio on an opportunistic basis. We, our subsidiaries, or our affiliates may also agree to manage certain other funds that invest in debt, equity or provide other financing or services to companies in a variety of industries for which we may earn management or other fees for our services. We may also invest in the equity of these funds, along with other third parties, from which we would seek to earn a return and/or future incentive allocations. We may enter into new joint venture partnerships to create additional third-party capital to originate loans. Some of these transactions could be material to our business. Consummation of any such transaction will be subject to completion of due diligence, finalization of key business and financial terms (including price) and negotiation of final definitive documentation as well as a number of other factors and conditions including, without limitation, the approval of our board of directors and required regulatory or third-party consents and, in certain cases, the approval of our shareholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any such transaction would be consummated. Any of these transactions or funds may require significant management resources either during the transaction phase or on an ongoing basis depending on the terms of the transaction.\nInterest Expense\nOur common shares are currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol NEWT\u201d.\nDividends\nIn March 2019, the 2010-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2010-1 Trust assets, with the 2010-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price.\nWe consolidate the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nIssuance of Notes due 2026 and Redemption of Notes due 2023\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities provided cash of $17,763,000, consisting primarily of (i) $1,356,710,000 of proceeds from the sale of SBA 7(a) guaranteed loan investments, (ii) $61,976,000 of principal payments received from SBA non-affiliate investments and (iii) $19,221,000 in return of investment from controlled investments.\n\n\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company would then pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no U.S. federal excise taxes were due.\n\u2022net worth and liquidity of the guarantors on our loans may decline, which could cause loan losses to increase;\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nIn September 2015, the Company and the Trustee entered into the Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture relating to the Company's issuance, offer, and sale of $8,324,000, including the underwriter's partial exercise of their over-allotment option, in aggregate principal amount of the 7.5% Notes due 2022. The 2022 Notes are the Company's direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company's other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company's future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2022 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company's subsidiaries.\nIn July 2019, the 2014-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2014-1 Trust assets, with the 2014-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price.\nNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments relates to guaranteed portions of SBA debt investments made which the Company sells into a secondary market. Unrealized appreciation of SBA guaranteed investments represents the fair value adjustment of guaranteed portions of loans which have not yet been sold. Unrealized depreciation represents the reversal of unrealized appreciation when the SBA 7(a) loans are sold.\nWe receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA loan investments which we sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned and recorded daily. Servicing income is earned for the full term of the loan or until the loan is repaid.\nOn July 10, 2019, the Company entered into the 2019 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. The 2019 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement provided that the Company may offer and sell up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time through the placement agents. From inception through June 24, 2020, we sold 1,716,517 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $21.88 per share. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $37,554,000. On June 24, 2020, the Company terminated the 2019 ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. The Company paid the ATM placement agents $758,000 in compensation.\nNotes Payable - Related Parties\nCommon Stock\nWe receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including packaging fees, legal fees, late fees and prepayment fees.
