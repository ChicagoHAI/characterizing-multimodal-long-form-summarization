MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in \"Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking and Other Information.\"\nOverview\nWe are a national retailer primarily focused on selling home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and hardware. In addition to merchandise, we provide our customers with access to a full suite of related services, including home delivery, installation, and extended-service plans. As of February 3, 2018, we and our independent dealers and franchisees operated a total of 900 stores across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda. In fiscal year 2017, the Company opened 7 stores and closed 127 stores.\nOur Hometown stores are designed to provide our customers with in-store and online access to a wide selection of national brands of home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, sporting goods, and household goods, depending on the format. Our Outlet stores are designed to provide our customers with in-store and online access to purchase, at prices that are significantly lower than list prices, new, one-of-a-kind, out-of-carton, discontinued, obsolete, used, reconditioned, overstocked, and scratched and dented products across a broad assortment of merchandise categories, including home appliances, apparel, mattresses, lawn and garden equipment, sporting goods and tools.\nAs of February 3, 2018, Hometown consisted of 768 stores as follows:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>713 Hometown Stores-Primarily independently operated stores, predominantly located in smaller communities, and offering home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, sporting goods, and household goods. All of our Hometown Stores carry proprietary Sears-branded products, such as Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard, as well as a wide assortment of other national brands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>19 Hardware Stores-Hardware stores that offer primarily home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and other home improvement products, and featuring Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard, as well as a wide assortment of other national brands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>36 Home Appliance Showrooms-Stores that have a simple, primarily appliance showroom design that are located in metropolitan areas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of February 3, 2018, our Hometown segment included 707 dealer-operated stores, 32 franchisee-operated stores, and 29 Company-operated stores. The business model and economic structure of the dealer-operated and franchisee-operated stores, which are independently owned, are substantially similar to Company-operated stores in many respects. The Company requires all of the stores to operate under specified circumstances according to the Company's standards. Stores must display the required merchandise, offer all required products and services, and use the Company's point of sale system. Also, the Company has the right to approve advertising and promotional and marketing materials and imposes specified advertising requirements on the owners. The Company owns the merchandise, establishes all selling prices for the merchandise, and bears general inventory risk (with specific exceptions) until sale of the merchandise and if the customer returns the merchandise. In addition, because each transaction is recorded in the Company's point of sale system, the Company bears customer credit risk. The Company establishes a commission structure for stores operated by our dealers and franchisees and pays commissions when our dealers and franchisees sell the merchandise and provide services.\nHistorically, all of the Company's Outlet stores were operated by the Company. We initiated efforts to franchise Outlet stores in 2012, with the first stores transferred to franchisees during the 2013 fiscal year. During the second quarter of 2015 the Company suspended its franchising of additional stores except to existing Company franchisees, and the suspension is continuing. As of February 3, 2018, 11 of the 132 Sears Outlet stores were operated by franchisees.\nOur dealers and franchisees exercise control over the operations of their stores, including complete responsibility for supervising their store management and their store employees and making capital decisions. Several of the primary differences between Company-operated stores and dealer or franchisee-operated stores are that (1) the Company is responsible for occupancy and\npayroll costs associated with Company-operated stores while our dealers and franchisees are responsible for these costs for their stores, (2) the Company is responsible for all terms and conditions of employment for the employees in the Company-operated stores and our dealers and franchisees are responsible for all terms and conditions of employment for the employees in their stores, and (3) we pay commissions to our dealers and franchisees.\nIn the normal course of business, stores can transition from Company-operated to franchisee or dealer-operated, and vice-versa. Potential new store locations may be identified by the Company, an existing dealer or franchisee, or a potential dealer or franchisee. If the Company identifies and develops a location, it will generally seek to transfer that store to a dealer. When the Company takes back a store from a franchisee, the Company's gross margin will generally decrease as the our cost of occupancy, which is reflected in cost of sales and occupancy will increase. In addition, the Company's selling and administrative expense will decrease as the Company's commission payments, which are reflected in selling and administrative expense, will decrease. The decrease in commission payments will be partially offset by higher payroll and benefits expense.\nInitial franchise revenues consist of franchise fees paid with respect to new and existing Company-operated stores that we transfer to franchisees plus the net gain or loss on any related transfer of assets to the franchisees. The number of new franchised stores, the number of Company-operated stores transferred, and the net gain or loss per store transferred are variable from quarter to quarter. The variation is driven by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, which influence both the level of new store development and the level of interest of existing or potential franchisees in acquiring store locations, and economic factors specific to our major product categories, such as appliances. Each of these factors impacts the expected returns on new store development and the number of Company-operated locations available for sale to franchisees. Initial franchise revenues were $0.0 million, $(0.2) million, and $0.3 million in the 2017, 2016, and 2015 fiscal years, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company suspended its franchising of additional stores except to existing Company franchisees, and the suspension is continuing.\nFranchisee Receivables Charges\nThe Company had a provision for collectability (net of recoveries) related to franchisee receivables of $7.4 million in 2017 compared to net recoveries of $0.8 million in 2016 and $25.4 million net expense in 2015.\nMerchandise Subsidies and Cash Discounts from Sears Holdings\nIn accordance with our Amended and Restated Merchandising Agreement with Sears Holdings, SHO receives from Sears Holdings specified portions of merchandise subsidies collected by Sears Holdings from its merchandise vendors and specified portions of cash discounts earned by Sears Holdings as a result of its early payment of merchandise-vendor payables (together \"Vendor Funds\"). For 2017 Sears Holdings' Vendor Funds were higher compared to 2016 and SHO's portion of the collected Vendor Funds during 2017 were approximately $5.2 million higher than SHO's portion for 2016. While we cannot provide any assurance that SHO's portion of Vendor Funds collected by Sears Holdings will not decline, stay the same, or continue to increase, our portion could decline in 2018 due to an expected increase in purchases through our direct vendor relationships. If SHO's portion of Vendor Funds collected by Sears Holdings were to decline significantly, SHO's results of operations could be adversely affected to a material extent.\nHome Office Overhead Allocation\nSince the Separation we have included an allocation of Home Office overhead expenses in selling and administrative expenses from Hometown and Outlet. Home Office overhead expenses are primarily comprised of corporate headquarters payroll, benefits, and other costs and include charges related to our Services Agreement with Sears Holdings.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal years end on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to specific years in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to fiscal years. The following fiscal periods are presented herein:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weeks\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 3, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 28, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated results of operations for our 2017, 2016 and 2015 fiscal years.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET SALES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,719,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,070,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,287,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COSTS AND EXPENSES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales and occupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,371,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,661,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,769,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>408,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>518,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>419,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>458,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>546,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on the sale of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,203\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,807,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,117,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,329,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,172\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,058\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,826\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94,553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50,428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,413\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET LOSS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(95,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(131,919\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,261\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparable Store Sales\nComparable store sales amounts include merchandise sales for all stores operating for a period of at least 12 full months, including remodeled and expanded stores but excluding store relocations and stores that have undergone format changes. In addition, 2017 included an extra week (the \"53rd week\") compared to our 2016 fiscal year results. The 53rd week is not included in comparable store sales calculations.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIn addition to our net loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), for purposes of evaluating operating performance we also use adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA,\u201d which excludes certain significant items as set forth and discussed below. Our management uses adjusted EBITDA, among other factors, for evaluating the operating performance of our business for comparable periods. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used by investors or other third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as it excludes a number of important cash and non-cash recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP measurements.\nWhile adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, we believe it is an important indicator of operating performance for investors because:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>EBITDA excludes the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest and depreciation costs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other significant items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and may have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of results. These items may also include cash charges such as severance and executive transition costs and IT transformation investments that make it difficult for investors to assess the Company's core operating performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince 2015 the Company has excluded initial franchise revenues from adjusted EBITDA. This change is based on (1) the Company's decision to suspend its franchising of additional stores except to existing Company franchisees and (2) to better align adjusted EBITDA for purposes of incentive compensation.\nThe Company has undertaken an initiative on a limited number of occasions to accelerate the closing of under-performing stores in an effort to improve profitability and make the most productive use of capital. Under-performing stores are typically closed during the normal course of business at the termination of a lease or expiration of a franchise or dealer agreement and, as a result, do not have significant future lease, severance, or other non-recurring store-closing costs. When we close a significant number of stores or close them on an accelerated basis (closing prior to termination or expiration), the Company excludes the associated costs of the closings from adjusted EBITDA. In 2017 and 2016, we excluded $14.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively, of costs associated with the accelerated closure of under-performing stores.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(95,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(131,919\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,261\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,152\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(925\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,585\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,172\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on the sale of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,203\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance and executive transition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses, net of franchise revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(552\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IT transformation investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs associated with accelerated store closings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,525\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,521\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n53 Week Period Ended February 3, 2018 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017\nNet Sales\nNet sales for 2017 decreased $350.1 million, or 16.9%, to $1.7 billion from $2.1 billion in 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and an 8.4% decrease in comparable store sales. This decline was partially offset by sales of $23.4 million in the 53rd week. Comparable store sales were down 8.1% and 9.1% in Hometown and Outlet, respectively. The home appliances and lawn & garden categories both outperformed the average comparable store sales while tools underperformed to the average.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $348.5 million, or 20.3% of net sales, for 2017 compared to $408.7 million, or 19.7% of net sales, for 2016. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by higher margin on merchandise sales and lower shrink partially offset by higher occupancy costs as a percentage of sales resulting from a greater mix of Company-operated stores compared to the prior year. Accelerated store closing costs were $14.2 million for 2017 compared to $15.7 million for 2016. The total impact of occupancy costs, accelerated closing store costs, and shrink reduced gross margin rate 496 basis points for 2017 compared to a 490 basis-point reduction for 2016.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $419.6 million, or 24.4% of net sales, for 2017 from $458.8 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), (2) lower commissions paid to dealers and franchisees on lower sales volume and lower store count, (3) lower marketing costs, and (4) lower support costs paid to Sears Holdings. These decreases were partially offset by (1) higher IT Transformation costs ($34.4 million for 2017 compared to $15.0 for 2016), (2) expenses associated with the 53rd week, (3) $8.1 million higher provisions for 2017 related to franchisee notes receivables, and (4) higher payroll and benefits due to a higher mix of Company-\noperated stores. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT transformation costs and provisions for franchisee note receivables increased selling and administrative expenses 243 basis points for 2017 compared to 69 basis points for 2016.\nGain on Sale of Assets\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million.\nOperating Loss\nWe recorded an operating loss of $87.4 million and $47.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to the $25.2 million gain on sale of assets in 2016 and lower volume. These factors were partially offset by lower selling and administrative expense, a higher gross margin rate, lower impairment charges, and a $2.3 million favorable impact from the 53rd week.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $0.5 million for 2017 compared to $81.5 million for 2016, comprised primarily of $100.1 million non-cash valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets recorded in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act reduces the corporate rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The impact on our net deferred tax assets (\"DTA\") and deferred tax liabilities (\"DTL\") was a decrease of $35.2 million with a corresponding net adjustment to the valuation allowance for the year ended February 3, 2018.\nNet loss\nWe recorded a net loss of $95.1 million for 2017 compared to a net loss of $131.9 million for 2016. The decrease in our net loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in income tax expense partially offset by a higher operating loss and higher interest expense.\n52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 30, 2016\nNet Sales\nNet sales for 2016 decreased $217.7 million, or 9.5%, to $2.1 billion compared to 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and a 4.4% decrease in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales were down 4.2% and 4.9% in Hometown and Outlet, respectively. The home appliances and tools categories both outperformed the average comparable store sales while lawn and garden and mattresses underperformed the average.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $408.7 million, or 19.7% of net sales, for 2016 compared to $518.5 million, or 22.7% of net sales, for 2015. The decrease in gross margin rate was primarily driven by higher occupancy costs due to more Company-operated locations, lower margin on merchandise sales, $15.7 million of store-closing costs, and $8.5 million higher shrink resulting from $3.7 million physical inventory charges in Outlet in 2016 as compared to $4.6 million of physical inventory gains in Hometown in 2015. The total impact of occupancy costs, accelerated store-closing costs, and shrink reduced gross margin rate 490 basis points for 2016 compared to a reduction of 274 basis points for 2015.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $458.8 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016 from $546.1 million, or 23.9% of net sales, for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) lower commissions paid to dealers and franchisees on lower sales volume, (2) the conversion of some dealer and franchisee locations to Company-operated stores in 2016, which resulted in some costs previously recorded as selling and administrative expenses to be recorded as a reduction to gross margin, (3) lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), and (4) a $25.4 million charge in 2015 related to the write-off of, and additional reserves taken on, franchisee notes receivables. The Company recorded $1.0 million of store closing selling and administrative expenses for 2016. IT Transformation costs were $15.0 million for 2016 compared to $10.9 million for 2015. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT Transformation costs and charges related to franchise notes receivable increased selling and administrative expenses 69 basis points and 159 basis points for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGain on Sale of Assets\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million.\nOperating Loss\nWe recorded operating losses of $47.7 million and $42.2 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower volume, a lower gross margin rate, higher impairment charges of $9.4 million in 2016 as compared to $4.0 million in 2015, and higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses and a gain on the sale of assets.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $81.5 million in 2016, comprised primarily of a $100.1 million non-cash valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, and a benefit of $15.2 million in 2015. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K for further information.\nNet loss\nWe recorded a net loss of $131.9 million for 2016 compared to a net loss of $27.3 million for 2015. The increase in our net loss was primarily attributable to a higher operating loss, including store-closing costs, and an increase in income tax expense.\nBusiness Segment Results\nHometown\nHometown results and key statistics were as follows:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>thousands, except for number of stores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,177,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,439,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,630,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable store sales %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales and occupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>931,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,145,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,262,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>283,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>318,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on the sale of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,222,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,474,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,645,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,341\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,648\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Sears Hometown and Hardware stores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n53 Week Period Ended February 3, 2018 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 -- Hometown\nNet Sales\nNet sales in 2017 decreased $262.3 million, or 18.2%, to $1.2 billion from $1.4 billion in 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and a 8.1% decrease in comparable store sales. This decline was partially offset by sales of $13.9 million of sales in the 53rd week. Home appliances and lawn and garden outperformed the average comparable store sales while tools and mattresses underperformed to the average.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $246.1 million, or 20.9% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $293.9 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2016. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by lower closing store costs and lower occupancy costs partially offset by lower margin on merchandise sales. The total impact of store closing and occupancy costs decreased gross margin rate 172 basis points for the full year 2017 compared to 260 basis points for the full year 2016.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $283.3 million, or 24.1% of net sales, in 2017 from $318.6 million, or 22.1% of net sales, in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), lower dealer and franchisee commissions on lower sales volume and lower store counts, and lower marketing expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher IT transformation costs ($22.9 million, or 194 basis points on a rate-to-sales basis, for 2017 compared to $9.9 million, or 69 basis points, for 2016).\nOperating Loss\nWe recorded operating losses of $45.1 million and $35.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in our operating loss was primarily due to lower volume partially offset by reduced selling and administrative expense, a higher gross margin rate, lower impairment charges, and a $0.8 million favorable impact from the 53rd week.\n52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 30, 2016 -- Hometown\nNet Sales\nNet sales in 2016 decreased $190.7 million, or 11.7%, to $1.4 billion from 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and a 4.2% decrease in comparable store sales. Home appliances, tools, and mattresses outperformed the average comparable store sales while lawn and garden underperformed to the average.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $293.9 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $368.1 million, or 22.6% of net sales, in 2015. The decrease in gross margin rate was primarily driven by (1) $15.1 million of store-closing costs, (2) lower margin on merchandise sales, (3) higher occupancy costs due to an increase in the number of Company-operated stores, and (4) higher shrink due to $4.6 million of physical inventory gains in 2015. The total impact of occupancy, store-closing costs, and shrink reduced gross margin rate 285 basis points for 2016 compared to a reduction of 124 basis points for 2015.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $318.6 million, or 22.1% of net sales, in 2016 from $378.1 million, or 23.2% of net sales, in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of (1) lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), (2) lower dealer and franchisee commissions on lower sales volume, (3) converting some dealer and franchisee locations to Company-operated stores in 2016, which resulted in some costs previously recorded as selling and administrative expenses to be recorded as a reduction to gross margin, and (4) a $12.7 million charge in 2015 related to expenses for uncollectible franchise notes receivable. The Company recorded $0.9 million of selling and administrative expenses related to store closings for 2016. IT Transformation costs were $9.9 million for 2016 compared to $7.4 million for 2015. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT Transformation costs and charges related to franchise notes receivable increased selling and administrative expenses 64 basis points and 123 basis points for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOperating Loss\nWe recorded operating losses of $35.3 million and $15.6 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in our operating loss was primarily attributable to lower volume, lower gross margin rate, higher impairment charges, and higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in selling and administration expenses.\nOutlet\nOutlet results and key statistics were as follows:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>thousands, except for number of stores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>542,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>630,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable store sales %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales and occupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>507,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on the sale of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>585,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>642,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>684,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42,311\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,314\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,524\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Sears Outlet stores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n53 Week Period Ended February 3, 2018 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 -- Outlet\nNet Sales\nNet sales in 2017 decreased $87.8 million, or 13.9%, to $542.7 million from 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by a 9.1% decrease in comparable store sales and closed stores (net of new store openings) partially offset by $9.5 million in the 53rd week. Lawn and garden, furniture and mattresses outperformed the average comparable store sales while home appliances, tools, and apparel underperformed to the average.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $102.4 million, or 18.9% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $114.9 million, or 18.2% of net sales, in 2016. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by a higher gross profit rate on merchandise sales primarily driven by new pricing strategies and renegotiated merchandise costs and lower shrink expenses. These increases were partially offset by flat occupancy costs, but higher on a rate-to-sales basis, and higher store closings costs ($7.6 million for 2017 compared to $1.0 million for 2016). The total impact of store closing costs, occupancy costs and shrink was a reduction to gross margin rate of 1,131 basis points for 2017 compared to 957 basis points for 2016.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $136.3 million, or 25.1% of net sales, for 2017 compared to $140.2 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower franchisee commissions on lower sales volumes and lower store counts, lower expenses being recorded for stores closed and lower marketing expense. These reductions were partially offset by $7.6 million higher provisions for franchisee receivables, higher IT transformation costs ($11.5 million for 2017 compared to $5.1 million for 2016), and expenses associated with the 53rd week. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT transformation costs and provisions for franchisee note receivables increased selling and administrative expense 351 basis points for 2017 compared to 80 basis points for 2016.\nGain on Sale of Asset\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million. We did not sell any owned property in fiscal 2017.\nOperating Loss\nWe recorded operating losses of $42.3 million and $12.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $30.0 million increase in operating loss was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of assets in 2016 and lower volume, partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses, higher gross margin rates, and a $1.5 million favorable impact from the 53rd week.\n52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 30, 2016 -- Outlet\nNet Sales\nNet sales in 2016 decreased $27.0 million, or 4.1%, to $630.5 million from 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by a 4.9% decrease in comparable store sales, partially offset by the impact of new stores (net of closings). Home appliances, tools, and furniture outperformed the average comparable store sales while apparel, mattresses and lawn and garden underperformed to the average.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $114.9 million, or 18.2% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $150.4 million, or 22.9% of net sales, in 2015. The decrease in gross margin rate was primarily driven by (1) a lower gross profit rate on merchandise sales primarily driven by price reductions needed to maintain the competitiveness of out-of-box product in a more promotional environment for new, in-box appliances, (2) higher occupancy costs due to more Company-operated locations, (3) higher shrink expenses related to $3.7 million of physical inventory charges taken in 2016, and (4) $1.0 million of store closing costs. The total impact of occupancy, shrink, and store closing costs reduced gross margin rate 957 basis points for 2016 compared to a reduction of 645 basis points 2015.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $140.2 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016 compared to $168.0 million, or 25.5% of net sales, for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower franchisee commissions on lower sales volumes, converting some franchisee locations to Company-operated stores in 2016 (which resulted in some costs previously recorded as selling and administrative expenses being recorded as a reduction to gross margin), and $12.7 million of provisions for franchisee note receivables in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by higher payroll and benefits costs resulting from a higher number of Company-operated stores. The Company recorded $0.1 million of store-closing selling and administrative expenses for 2016. IT Transformation costs were $5.1 million for 2016 compared to $3.5 million for 2015. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT Transformation costs and charges related to franchise notes receivable increased selling and administrative expense 80 basis points and 247 basis points for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGain on Sale of Asset\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million.\nOperating Loss\nWe recorded operating losses of $12.3 million and $26.5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $14.2 million decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of owned property located in San Leandro, California and lower selling and administrative expenses partially offset by lower volume and gross margin.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nCash Balances\nWe had $10.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of February 3, 2018 and $14.1 million as of January 28, 2017.\nDuring 2017 we financed our operations and investments with cash generated from financing activities. Our primary liquidity needs are for funding inventory purchases, our IT transformation, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities in 2017 was $105.6 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $28.9 million in 2016. Our 2017 cash use was driven by a $52.6 million reduction in payables to Sears Holdings and $34.4 million in IT transformation costs. In 2016 $28.9 million of cash was generated primarily due to a reduction in net inventory investment (inventory less payable). Total merchandise inventories were $336.3 million at February 3, 2018 and $373.8 million at January 29, 2017. Merchandise inventories declined $13.9 million and $23.6 million in Hometown and Outlet, respectively, primarily due to store closures.\nWe obtain our merchandise through agreements with subsidiaries of Sears Holdings and with other vendors. Merchandise acquired from subsidiaries of Sears Holdings (including Kenmore, Craftsman, DieHard, and other merchandise) accounted for approximately 78% and 80% of total purchases of all inventory from all vendors for 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect the percentage of total purchases of inventory acquired from subsidiaries of Sears Holdings to decrease in the future as we increase our direct purchases from other merchandise vendors. Fourth quarter 2017 purchases from Sears Holdings accounted for 74% of total purchases compared to 84% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 76% in the third quarter of 2017. The loss of, or a material reduction in, the amount of merchandise made available to us by Sears Holdings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our merchandise-vendor arrangements generally are not long-term agreements and none of them guarantees the availability of merchandise inventory in the future. Our growth strategy depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with sufficient merchandise inventory. As a result, our success depends on maintaining good relations with our existing vendors and on developing relationships with new vendors, especially with respect to merchandise inventory to be sold by Outlet. If we fail to maintain our relations with our existing vendors or to maintain the quality of merchandise inventory they supply to us, or if we cannot maintain or acquire new vendors of favored brand-name merchandise inventory, and if we cannot acquire new vendors of merchandise inventory to be sold by Outlet, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise at acceptable prices may be limited, which would have a negative impact on our competitive position. In addition, merchandise inventory acquired from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality and more expensive than the merchandise inventory that we currently purchase. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $9.2 million in 2017 compared to cash provided of $13.9 million in 2016. In the second quarter of 2016 we received proceeds of $26.1 million from the sale of assets.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $111.2 million for 2017 compared to cash used in financing activities of $46.9 million for 2016. The increase of $158.1 million in cash provided by financing activities in 2017 from 2016 was primarily due to greater net borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility in 2017.\nFinancing Arrangements\nSenior ABL Facility\nIn October 2012 the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, including Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, which provided (subject to availability under a borrowing base) for aggregate maximum borrowings of $250 million (the \"Prior Facility\"). Under the Prior Facility the Company initially borrowed $100 million which was used to pay a cash dividend to Sears Holdings prior to the Separation. On November 1, 2016 the Company's three operating subsidiaries, Sears Authorized Hometown Stores, LLC, Sears Home Appliance Showrooms, LLC, and Sears Outlet Stores, L.L.C., and the Company, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (which amended and restated the Prior Facility) with a syndicate of lenders, including Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, which provides (subject to availability under a borrowing base) for aggregate maximum borrowings of $250 million (the \"Senior ABL Facility\"). The Senior ABL Facility provides for extended revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount equal to $170 million (the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments\u201d) and non-extended revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount equal to $80 million (the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments\u201d). The Extended Revolving Credit Commitments will mature on the earlier of (1) February 29, 2020 and (2) six months prior to the expiration of agreements entered into with Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries\nin connection with the Company's separation from Sears Holdings in October 2012 (the \"Subject Agreements\") unless they are extended to a date later than February 29, 2020 or terminated on a basis reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent under the Senior ABL Facility. The Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments were not extended by the Non-Extending Lenders in accordance with the Senior ABL Facility and matured on October 11, 2017. Unamortized debt costs related to the Senior ABL Facility of $3.5 million are included in Prepaid and Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 3, 2018 and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Senior ABL Facility.\nAs of February 3, 2018 we had $137.9 million outstanding under the Senior ABL Facility, which approximated the fair value of these borrowings. Up to $75 million of the Senior ABL Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25 million is available for swingline loans. The Senior ABL Facility permits us to request commitment increases in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million. Availability under the Senior ABL Facility as of February 3, 2018 was $24.9 million, with $7.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility.\nThe principal terms of the Senior ABL Facility are summarized below.\nPrepayments\nThe Senior ABL Facility is subject to mandatory prepayment in amounts equal to the amount by which the outstanding extensions of credit exceed the lesser of the borrowing base and the commitments then in effect.\nSecurity and Guarantees\nThe Senior ABL Facility is secured by a first lien security interest on substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles, investment property, equipment, cash, cash equivalents, deposit accounts and securities accounts, as well as certain other assets (other than intellectual property and fee-owned interests in real property) ancillary to any of the foregoing and all proceeds of any of the foregoing, including cash proceeds and the proceeds of applicable insurance. The Senior ABL Facility is guaranteed by the Company and each of its existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (other than specified immaterial subsidiaries).\nInterest; Fees\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Senior ABL Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at the Company's election, either (1) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a borrowing margin ranging from (x) 3.50% to 4.50%, in the case of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or (y) 2.00% to 2.50%, in the case of the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (which the blended rate was approximately 5.02% at February 3, 2018 and 3.94% at January 28, 2017), and in each case based on availability under the Senior ABL Facility, or (2) an alternate base rate plus a borrowing margin, ranging from (x) 2.50% to 3.50%, in the case of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or (y) 1.00% to 1.50%, in the case of the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (which the blended rate was approximately 8.00% at February 3, 2018 and 5.94% at January 28, 2017), and in each case based on availability under the Senior ABL Facility.\nCustomary fees are payable in respect of the Senior ABL Facility, including letter of credit fees and commitment fees.\nCovenants\nThe Senior ABL Facility includes a number of negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the guarantors) to, subject to certain exceptions, incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees), grant liens, make investments, make prepayments on other indebtedness, and engage in mergers or change the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the guarantors). In addition, upon excess availability falling below a specified level the Company would be subject to a cash dominion requirement and more frequent borrowing base reporting requirements. The Senior ABL Facility also limits SHO's ability to declare and pay cash dividends and to repurchase its common stock. The Senior ABL Facility would not have permitted us to pay cash dividends or to repurchase our common stock as of February 3, 2018. The Senior ABL Facility also contains affirmative covenants, including financial and other reporting requirements.\nEvents of Default\nThe Senior ABL Facility includes customary and other events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross default to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of guarantees or security interests, material judgments, change of control, failure to perform a \"Material Contract\" (which includes the Merchandising Agreement and other SHO-Sears Holdings Agreements) to the extent required to maintain it in full force and effect, the failure to enforce a Material Contract in accordance with its terms, or Sears Holdings terminates the \"Separation Agreements\" (which include, among other SHO-Sears Holdings Agreements, the Merchandising Agreement and the Services Agreements).\nTerm Loan Agreement\nSubsequent to year-end, on February 16, 2018 the Company's three operating subsidiaries, Sears Authorized Hometown Stores, LLC, Sears Home Appliance Showrooms, LLC, and Sears Outlet Stores, L.L.C., as borrowers, and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Gordon Brothers Finance Company, as agent, lead arranger, and sole bookrunner, and Gordon Brothers Finance Company, LLC as lender (the Term Loan Agreement\u201d). The Term Loan Agreement provides for a $40 million term loan (the Term Loan\u201d), which amount the Company has borrowed, and is outstanding, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Agreement. The Company used the proceeds of the Term Loan to pay down borrowings under the Senior ABL Facility. The Term Loan will mature on the earliest of (1) the maturity date specified in the Senior ABL Facility, (2) February 16, 2023, and (3) acceleration of the maturity date following an event of default in accordance with the Term Loan Agreement.\nCosts related to and incurred for the Term Loan totaled approximately $1.0 million.\nThe principal terms of the Term Loan Agreement are summarized below.\nSecurity and Guarantees\nThe Term Loan Agreement is secured by a second lien security interest (subordinate only to the liens securing the Senior ABL Facility) on substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (the same assets as the assets specified with respect to the Senior ABL Facility), including without limitation accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles, investment property, equipment, cash, cash equivalents, deposit accounts and securities accounts, as well as other assets (other than intellectual property and fee-owned interests in real property) ancillary to any of the foregoing and all proceeds of any of the foregoing, including cash proceeds and the proceeds of applicable insurance. The Term Loan Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and each of its existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (other than specified immaterial subsidiaries).\nPrepayments\nThe Term Loan is subject to mandatory prepayment in amounts equal to the amount by which the outstanding Term Loan exceeds the borrowing base specified in the Term Loan Agreement plus a reserve to be maintained against the borrowing base for the Senior ABL Facility (the push-down reserve\u201d), which reserve will be equal to total outstandings under the Term Loan Agreement that exceed the Term Loan Agreement's borrowing base, if such excess were to arise. The Company may not reborrow amounts prepaid.\nInterest; Fees\nThe interest rate applicable to the Term Loan under the Term Loan Agreement is a fluctuating rate of interest (payable and adjusted monthly) equal to the greater of (1) three-month LIBOR plus 8.5% per annum and (2) a minimum interest rate of 9.5% per annum. Customary fees are payable in respect of the Term Loan Agreement, including a commitment fee and an early prepayment fee.\nCovenants\nThe Term Loan Agreement includes a number of negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company, the Borrowers, and the Company's other subsidiaries to, subject to exceptions, incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees), grant liens, make investments, make dividends or other distributions with respect to, or repurchase, the Company's capital stock, make prepayments on other indebtedness, engage in mergers, or change the nature of the business. In addition, upon excess availability falling below a specified level or the occurrence of an event of default the Company would be subject to a cash dominion requirement. The Term Loan Agreement also provides that the Borrowers will not permit availability under the Term Loan Agreement and the Senior ABL Facility to be less than 10% of a combined loan cap.\nThe Term Loan Agreement also contains affirmative covenants including, among others, financial and other reporting and notification requirements, maintenance of properties, inspection rights, and physical inventories. The Company and the Borrowers also agree that the Company and the Borrowers will cause the push-down reserve to be established and maintained when and if required by the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement borrowing base generally means specified amounts of credit card receivables and inventory (net of reserves), minus the loan cap for the Senior ABL Facility and availability reserves.\nEvents of Default\nThe Term Loan Agreement includes customary events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, cross default to the Senior ABL Facility and other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of the Term Loan Agreement and the other related loan documents (including the guarantees or security interests provided therein), material judgments, and change of control.\nUses and Sources of Liquidity\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from our operating activities, and, to the extent necessary, availability under the Senior ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. As a result, we expect to fund our ongoing operations through existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operating activities, and with funds available under the Senior ABL Facility. The adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment and the operating performance of our stores. See for example \"If Sears Holdings' seeks the protection of the U.S. bankruptcy laws, our ability to operate our business and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs of February 3, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.4 million.\nCapital lease obligations were $0.6 million and $0.5 million as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nInformation concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contract such as debt and lease agreements and under contingent commitments as of February 3, 2018 is as aggregated in the following table:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Within\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing the financial statements, certain accounting policies require considerable judgment to select the appropriate assumptions to calculate financial estimates. These estimates are complex and subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our estimates on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, evaluation of trends and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Although the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the financial statements, we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>it requires assumptions to be made about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or different estimates that could have been selected would have a material effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and the considerations used in estimating amounts, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe following is a summary of our most critical policies and estimates. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a listing of our other significant accounting policies.\nValuation of Inventory\nOur inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined under the retail inventory method, or \"RIM,\" using primarily a last-in, first-out, or \"LIFO,\" cost-flow assumption. To determine inventory cost under RIM, inventory at its retail selling value is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics, which are then converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each grouping of merchandise. Cost factors represent the average cost-to-retail ratio for each merchandise group based upon the year's purchasing activity for each store location. Accordingly, a significant assumption under the retail method is that inventory in each group is similar in terms of its cost-to-retail relationship and has similar turnover rates. We monitor the content of merchandise in these groupings to prevent distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation.\nRIM inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation, as well as gross margin. The methodologies utilized by SHO in its application of RIM are consistent for all periods presented. Such methodologies include the development of the cost-to-retail ratios, the groupings of homogeneous classes of merchandise, the development of shrinkage and obsolescence reserves, and the accounting for retail price changes. We believe that SHO's RIM provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost. Among others, two significant estimates used in inventory valuation are the level and timing of permanent markdowns (clearance markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow-moving inventory) and shrinkage. Amounts are charged to cost of sales at the time the retail value of inventory is reduced through the use of permanent markdowns.\nFactors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise, fashion and design trends and weather conditions. In addition, inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre-determined historical markdown cadences. When a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise, the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded. The timing of the decision, particularly surrounding the balance sheet date, can have a significant effect on the results of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that will affect our fiscal year ending February 3, 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, (2) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, and (3) various other miscellaneous changes that are effective in fiscal 2017. The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% in the fiscal year ending February 3, 2018. Based on Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code, our fiscal year ending February 3, 2018 will have a blended corporate tax rate of 33.72%, which is based on the applicable tax rates before and after the Tax Act and the number of days in the year.\nThe Tax Act also establishes new tax laws that will affect fiscal 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate; (2) the elimination of corporate AMT; (3) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (4) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (5) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; and (6) limitations on net operating losses (NOLs) generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, to 80% of taxable income. The estimated impact of the new tax law on the Company's financial statements and the related accounting requirements are discussed in Note 5.\nOur deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management has determined a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets is still necessary as of February 3, 2018. For the current year the valuation allowance decreased by $8.5 million to an ending balance of $92.4 million. The decrease in the valuation allowance is mainly attributable to the reduction in the federal tax rate but also includes a tax benefit of $0.8 million due to the valuation allowance release for the reclassification of the AMT DTA. In the future, we may record additional net deferred tax assets and if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain, we may record additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income (loss), the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income.\nWe account for uncertainties in income taxes according to accounting standards for uncertain tax positions. We are present in a large number of taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time, can have audits underway at various stages of completion in any of these jurisdictions. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law, and closing of statutes of limitation. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, which governs the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to pre-Separation and post-Separation tax matters, Sears Holdings is responsible for any unrecognized tax benefits through the date of the Separation.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, if any. As further described above, we consider estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Our actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and our forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Although we believe current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nIn accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, Sears Holdings is responsible for any federal, state or foreign income tax liability relating to tax periods ending on or before the Separation.\nReserve for Losses on Franchisee Receivables\nThe Company recognizes a reserve for losses on franchisee receivables (which consist primarily of franchisee promissory notes) in an amount equal to estimated probable losses net of recoveries. The reserve is based on an analysis of expected future write-offs, existing economic conditions, and an assessment of specific identifiable franchisee promissory notes and other franchisee receivables considered at risk or uncollectible. The expense associated with the reserve for losses on franchisee receivables is recognized as selling and administrative expense. Most of our franchisee promissory notes authorize us to deduct debt service from our commissions otherwise due and payable to the franchisees, and we routinely make those deductions to the extent of available commissions payable. The reserve for losses on franchisee receivables is evaluated based on our receivable-by-receivable assessment during the year that loan balances would be potentially uncollectible in future periods due to declining results of operations of, or other adverse financial events with respect to, franchise stores that indicated that the franchisees might not be able to meet their debt-service and other obligations to us as they became due. During fiscal 2017 we forgave balances due on franchisee receivables in accordance with negotiated franchise-termination agreements, and as part of these transactions, the Company purchased store furniture, fixtures, and equipment from franchisees.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING AND OTHER INFORMATION\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the forward looking statements\u201d).

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf, whether as a result of new information, future developments, subsequent events or circumstances, or otherwise, except as required by law.", "item_7_truncated": "Net sales for 2016 decreased $217.7 million, or 9.5%, to $2.1 billion compared to 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and a 4.4% decrease in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales were down 4.2% and 4.9% in Hometown and Outlet, respectively. The home appliances and tools categories both outperformed the average comparable store sales while lawn and garden and mattresses underperformed the average.\nOperating Loss\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, if any.

The following fiscal periods are presented herein:\n \u2022 Other significant items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and may have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of results. These items may also include cash charges such as severance and executive transition costs and IT transformation investments that make it difficult for investors to assess the Company's core operating performance. \nEvents of Default\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $136.3 million, or 25.1% of net sales, for 2017 compared to $140.2 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower franchisee commissions on lower sales volumes and lower store counts, lower expenses being recorded for stores closed and lower marketing expense. These reductions were partially offset by $7.6 million higher provisions for franchisee receivables, higher IT transformation costs ($11.5 million for 2017 compared to $5.1 million for 2016), and expenses associated with the 53rd week. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT transformation costs and provisions for franchisee note receivables increased selling and administrative expense 351 basis points for 2017 compared to 80 basis points for 2016.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nCustomary fees are payable in respect of the Senior ABL Facility, including letter of credit fees and commitment fees.\n \u2022 36 Home Appliance Showrooms-Stores that have a simple, primarily appliance showroom design that are located in metropolitan areas. \nWhile adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, we believe it is an important indicator of operating performance for investors because:\nOur inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined under the retail inventory method, or \"RIM,\" using primarily a last-in, first-out, or \"LIFO,\" cost-flow assumption. To determine inventory cost under RIM, inventory at its retail selling value is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics, which are then converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each grouping of merchandise. Cost factors represent the average cost-to-retail ratio for each merchandise group based upon the year's purchasing activity for each store location. Accordingly, a significant assumption under the retail method is that inventory in each group is similar in terms of its cost-to-retail relationship and has similar turnover rates. We monitor the content of merchandise in these groupings to prevent distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation.\nWe recorded operating losses of $45.1 million and $35.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in our operating loss was primarily due to lower volume partially offset by reduced selling and administrative expense, a higher gross margin rate, lower impairment charges, and a $0.8 million favorable impact from the 53rd week.\nThe principal terms of the Term Loan Agreement are summarized below.\nCovenants\n52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 30, 2016 -- Hometown\nOperating Loss\nOutlet results and key statistics were as follows:\noperated stores. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT transformation costs and provisions for franchisee note receivables increased selling and administrative expenses 243 basis points for 2017 compared to 69 basis points for 2016.\nCovenants\nIn addition, our merchandise-vendor arrangements generally are not long-term agreements and none of them guarantees the availability of merchandise inventory in the future. Our growth strategy depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with sufficient merchandise inventory. As a result, our success depends on maintaining good relations with our existing vendors and on developing relationships with new vendors, especially with respect to merchandise inventory to be sold by Outlet. If we fail to maintain our relations with our existing vendors or to maintain the quality of merchandise inventory they supply to us, or if we cannot maintain or acquire new vendors of favored brand-name merchandise inventory, and if we cannot acquire new vendors of merchandise inventory to be sold by Outlet, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise at acceptable prices may be limited, which would have a negative impact on our competitive position. In addition, merchandise inventory acquired from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality and more expensive than the merchandise inventory that we currently purchase. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTerm Loan Agreement\n52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 30, 2016 -- Outlet\n\nOur deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management has determined a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets is still necessary as of February 3, 2018. For the current year the valuation allowance decreased by $8.5 million to an ending balance of $92.4 million. The decrease in the valuation allowance is mainly attributable to the reduction in the federal tax rate but also includes a tax benefit of $0.8 million due to the valuation allowance release for the reclassification of the AMT DTA. In the future, we may record additional net deferred tax assets and if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain, we may record additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income (loss), the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income.\nThe Senior ABL Facility is subject to mandatory prepayment in amounts equal to the amount by which the outstanding extensions of credit exceed the lesser of the borrowing base and the commitments then in effect.\nGross Margin\nThe interest rate applicable to the Term Loan under the Term Loan Agreement is a fluctuating rate of interest (payable and adjusted monthly) equal to the greater of (1) three-month LIBOR plus 8.5% per annum and (2) a minimum interest rate of 9.5% per annum. Customary fees are payable in respect of the Term Loan Agreement, including a commitment fee and an early prepayment fee.\nValuation of Inventory\nGross Margin\nThe principal terms of the Senior ABL Facility are summarized below.\n53 Week Period Ended February 3, 2018 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017\nAs of February 3, 2018 we had $137.9 million outstanding under the Senior ABL Facility, which approximated the fair value of these borrowings. Up to $75 million of the Senior ABL Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25 million is available for swingline loans. The Senior ABL Facility permits us to request commitment increases in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million. Availability under the Senior ABL Facility as of February 3, 2018 was $24.9 million, with $7.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility.\nThe following factors, among others, (1) could cause our actual results, performance, and achievements to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and one or more of the differences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and (2) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows: if Sears Holdings seeks the protection of the U.S. bankruptcy laws (including the effects of the imposition of the \"automatic stay\" and the effects if Sears Holdings were to seek to reject one or more of the SHO-Sears Holdings Agreements);

on March 9, 2017 Sears Holdings announced the Stanley Purchase (Sears Holdings has waived its right in the Amended and Restated Merchandising Agreement to terminate, as a result of the Stanley Purchase, the Company's rights to buy from Sears Holdings merchandise branded with the Craftsman brand); on July 20, 2017 Sears Holdings announced the launch of Kenmore products on Amazon.com and that Sears Holdings planned to expand the full line of Kenmore home appliances available on Amazon.com; on August 22, 2017 Sears Holdings announced licensing agreements with third parties to manufacture and distribute Kenmore floor care products and DieHard batteries and flashlights; the willingness and ability of Sears Holdings to fulfill its contractual obligations to us; our ability to successfully manage our inventory levels and implement initiatives to improve inventory management and other capabilities; competitive conditions in the retail industry; worldwide economic conditions and business uncertainty, the availability of consumer and commercial credit, changes in consumer confidence, tastes, preferences and spending, and changes in vendor relationships; the fact that our past performance generally, as reflected on our historical financial statements, may not be indicative of our future performance as a result of, among other things, the impact of increased costs due to a decrease in our purchasing power following the Separation, and other losses of benefits associated with having been wholly owned by Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries prior to the Separation; our continuing reliance on Sears Holdings for most products and services that are important to the successful operation of our business, and our potential need to rely on Sears Holdings for some products and services beyond the expiration, or earlier termination by Sears Holdings, of our agreements with Sears Holdings; the willingness of Sears Holdings' appliance, lawn and garden, tools, and other vendors to continue to supply to Sears Holdings on terms (including vendor-payment terms for Sears Holdings' merchandise purchases) that are acceptable to it (which vendor-payment terms, we believe, are becoming, and in the future could continue to become, increasingly uneconomic for Sears Holdings) and to us, merchandise that we would need to purchase from Sears Holdings to ensure continuity of merchandise supplies for our businesses; the willingness of Sears Holdings' appliance, lawn and garden, tools, and other vendors to continue to pay to Sears Holdings merchandise-related subsidies and allowances and cash discounts (some of which Sears Holdings is obligated to pay to us); our ability to resolve, on commercially reasonable terms, future disputes with Sears Holdings regarding the material terms and conditions of our agreements with Sears Holdings; our ability to establish information, merchandising, logistics, and other systems separate from Sears Holdings that would be necessary to ensure continuity of merchandise supplies and services for our businesses if vendors were to reduce, or cease, their merchandise sales to Sears Holdings or provide logistics and other services to Sears Holdings or if Sears Holdings were to reduce, or cease, its merchandise sales to us or reduce providing, or cease to provide, logistics and other services to us; if Sears Holdings' sales of major appliances and lawn and garden merchandise to its retail customers decline Sears Holdings' sales to us of outlet-value merchandise could decline; our ability to maintain an effective and productive business relationship with Sears Holdings, particularly if future disputes were to arise with respect to the terms and conditions of our agreements with Sears Holdings; most of our agreements related to the Separation and our continuing relationship with Sears Holdings were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Sears Holdings (except for amendments agreed to after the Separation), and we may have received different terms from unaffiliated third parties (including with respect to merchandise-vendor and service-provider indemnification and defense for negligence claims and claims\nNet Sales\nOperating Loss\nIncome tax expense was $81.5 million in 2016, comprised primarily of a $100.1 million non-cash valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, and a benefit of $15.2 million in 2015. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K for further information.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million. We did not sell any owned property in fiscal 2017.\nThe Company recognizes a reserve for losses on franchisee receivables (which consist primarily of franchisee promissory notes) in an amount equal to estimated probable losses net of recoveries. The reserve is based on an analysis of expected future write-offs, existing economic conditions, and an assessment of specific identifiable franchisee promissory notes and other franchisee receivables considered at risk or uncollectible. The expense associated with the reserve for losses on franchisee receivables is recognized as selling and administrative expense. Most of our franchisee promissory notes authorize us to deduct debt service from our commissions otherwise due and payable to the franchisees, and we routinely make those deductions to the extent of available commissions payable. The reserve for losses on franchisee receivables is evaluated based on our receivable-by-receivable assessment during the year that loan balances would be potentially uncollectible in future periods due to declining results of operations of, or other adverse financial events with respect to, franchise stores that indicated that the franchisees might not be able to meet their debt-service and other obligations to us as they became due. During fiscal 2017 we forgave balances due on franchisee receivables in accordance with negotiated franchise-termination agreements, and as part of these transactions, the Company purchased store furniture, fixtures, and equipment from franchisees.\nHome Office Overhead Allocation\nNet Sales\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 19 Hardware Stores-Hardware stores that offer primarily home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and other home improvement products, and featuring Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard, as well as a wide assortment of other national brands. \nGain on Sale of Assets\nThe Term Loan Agreement includes customary events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, cross default to the Senior ABL Facility and other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of the Term Loan Agreement and the other related loan documents (including the guarantees or security interests provided therein), material judgments, and change of control.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nGross Margin\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nNet Sales\nAs of February 3, 2018, Hometown consisted of 768 stores as follows:\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nFactors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise, fashion and design trends and weather conditions. In addition, inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre-determined historical markdown cadences. When a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise, the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded. The timing of the decision, particularly surrounding the balance sheet date, can have a significant effect on the results of operations.\nBusiness Segment Results\n\nWe recorded operating losses of $35.3 million and $15.6 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in our operating loss was primarily attributable to lower volume, lower gross margin rate, higher impairment charges, and higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in selling and administration expenses.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $458.8 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016 from $546.1 million, or 23.9% of net sales, for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) lower commissions paid to dealers and franchisees on lower sales volume, (2) the conversion of some dealer and franchisee locations to Company-operated stores in 2016, which resulted in some costs previously recorded as selling and administrative expenses to be recorded as a reduction to gross margin, (3) lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), and (4) a $25.4 million charge in 2015 related to the write-off of, and additional reserves taken on, franchisee notes receivables. The Company recorded $1.0 million of store closing selling and administrative expenses for 2016. IT Transformation costs were $15.0 million for 2016 compared to $10.9 million for 2015. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT Transformation costs and charges related to franchise notes receivable increased selling and administrative expenses 69 basis points and 159 basis points for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nComparable Store Sales\n\nIncome tax expense was $0.5 million for 2017 compared to $81.5 million for 2016, comprised primarily of $100.1 million non-cash valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets recorded in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act reduces the corporate rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The impact on our net deferred tax assets (\"DTA\") and deferred tax liabilities (\"DTL\") was a decrease of $35.2 million with a corresponding net adjustment to the valuation allowance for the year ended February 3, 2018.\nNet sales in 2016 decreased $27.0 million, or 4.1%, to $630.5 million from 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by a 4.9% decrease in comparable store sales, partially offset by the impact of new stores (net of closings). Home appliances, tools, and furniture outperformed the average comparable store sales while apparel, mattresses and lawn and garden underperformed to the average.\nThe following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated results of operations for our 2017, 2016 and 2015 fiscal years.\nCapital lease obligations were $0.6 million and $0.5 million as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively.\nSince the Separation we have included an allocation of Home Office overhead expenses in selling and administrative expenses from Hometown and Outlet. Home Office overhead expenses are primarily comprised of corporate headquarters payroll, benefits, and other costs and include charges related to our Services Agreement with Sears Holdings.\nHometown\nIn accordance with our Amended and Restated Merchandising Agreement with Sears Holdings, SHO receives from Sears Holdings specified portions of merchandise subsidies collected by Sears Holdings from its merchandise vendors and specified portions of cash discounts earned by Sears Holdings as a result of its early payment of merchandise-vendor payables (together \"Vendor Funds\"). For 2017 Sears Holdings' Vendor Funds were higher compared to 2016 and SHO's portion of the collected Vendor Funds during 2017 were approximately $5.2 million higher than SHO's portion for 2016. While we cannot provide any assurance that SHO's portion of Vendor Funds collected by Sears Holdings will not decline, stay the same, or continue to increase, our portion could decline in 2018 due to an expected increase in purchases through our direct vendor relationships. If SHO's portion of Vendor Funds collected by Sears Holdings were to decline significantly, SHO's results of operations could be adversely affected to a material extent.\nEvents of Default\nIn accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, Sears Holdings is responsible for any federal, state or foreign income tax liability relating to tax periods ending on or before the Separation.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAs of February 3, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.4 million.\nFiscal Year\nWe are a national retailer primarily focused on selling home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and hardware. In addition to merchandise, we provide our customers with access to a full suite of related services, including home delivery, installation, and extended-service plans. As of February 3, 2018, we and our independent dealers and franchisees operated a total of 900 stores across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda. In fiscal year 2017, the Company opened 7 stores and closed 127 stores.\nGain on Sale of Asset\nNet sales in 2017 decreased $262.3 million, or 18.2%, to $1.2 billion from $1.4 billion in 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and a 8.1% decrease in comparable store sales. This decline was partially offset by sales of $13.9 million of sales in the 53rd week. Home appliances and lawn and garden outperformed the average comparable store sales while tools and mattresses underperformed to the average.\nin connection with the Company's separation from Sears Holdings in October 2012 (the \"Subject Agreements\") unless they are extended to a date later than February 29, 2020 or terminated on a basis reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent under the Senior ABL Facility. The Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments were not extended by the Non-Extending Lenders in accordance with the Senior ABL Facility and matured on October 11, 2017. Unamortized debt costs related to the Senior ABL Facility of $3.5 million are included in Prepaid and Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 3, 2018 and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Senior ABL Facility.\nSubsequent to year-end, on February 16, 2018 the Company's three operating subsidiaries, Sears Authorized Hometown Stores, LLC, Sears Home Appliance Showrooms, LLC, and Sears Outlet Stores, L.L.C., as borrowers, and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Gordon Brothers Finance Company, as agent, lead arranger, and sole bookrunner, and Gordon Brothers Finance Company, LLC as lender (the Term Loan Agreement\u201d). The Term Loan Agreement provides for a $40 million term loan (the Term Loan\u201d), which amount the Company has borrowed, and is outstanding, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Agreement. The Company used the proceeds of the Term Loan to pay down borrowings under the Senior ABL Facility. The Term Loan will mature on the earliest of (1) the maturity date specified in the Senior ABL Facility, (2) February 16, 2023, and (3) acceleration of the maturity date following an event of default in accordance with the Term Loan Agreement.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that will affect our fiscal year ending February 3, 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, (2) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, and (3) various other miscellaneous changes that are effective in fiscal 2017. The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% in the fiscal year ending February 3, 2018. Based on Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code, our fiscal year ending February 3, 2018 will have a blended corporate tax rate of 33.72%, which is based on the applicable tax rates before and after the Tax Act and the number of days in the year.\nCash used in investing activities was $9.2 million in 2017 compared to cash provided of $13.9 million in 2016. In the second quarter of 2016 we received proceeds of $26.1 million from the sale of assets.\nAs of February 3, 2018, our Hometown segment included 707 dealer-operated stores, 32 franchisee-operated stores, and 29 Company-operated stores. The business model and economic structure of the dealer-operated and franchisee-operated stores, which are independently owned, are substantially similar to Company-operated stores in many respects. The Company requires all of the stores to operate under specified circumstances according to the Company's standards. Stores must display the required merchandise, offer all required products and services, and use the Company's point of sale system. Also, the Company has the right to approve advertising and promotional and marketing materials and imposes specified advertising requirements on the owners. The Company owns the merchandise, establishes all selling prices for the merchandise, and bears general inventory risk (with specific exceptions) until sale of the merchandise and if the customer returns the merchandise. In addition, because each transaction is recorded in the Company's point of sale system, the Company bears customer credit risk. The Company establishes a commission structure for stores operated by our dealers and franchisees and pays commissions when our dealers and franchisees sell the merchandise and provide services.\nOverview\nCash provided by financing activities was $111.2 million for 2017 compared to cash used in financing activities of $46.9 million for 2016. The increase of $158.1 million in cash provided by financing activities in 2017 from 2016 was primarily due to greater net borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility in 2017.\nNet sales in 2017 decreased $87.8 million, or 13.9%, to $542.7 million from 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by a 9.1% decrease in comparable store sales and closed stores (net of new store openings) partially offset by $9.5 million in the 53rd week. Lawn and garden, furniture and mattresses outperformed the average comparable store sales while home appliances, tools, and apparel underperformed to the average.\nGross Margin\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOperating Loss\n \u2022 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or different estimates that could have been selected would have a material effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. \nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Senior ABL Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at the Company's election, either (1) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a borrowing margin ranging from (x) 3.50% to 4.50%, in the case of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or (y) 2.00% to 2.50%, in the case of the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (which the blended rate was approximately 5.02% at February 3, 2018 and 3.94% at January 28, 2017), and in each case based on availability under the Senior ABL Facility, or (2) an alternate base rate plus a borrowing margin, ranging from (x) 2.50% to 3.50%, in the case of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or (y) 1.00% to 1.50%, in the case of the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (which the blended rate was approximately 8.00% at February 3, 2018 and 5.94% at January 28, 2017), and in each case based on availability under the Senior ABL Facility.\nGross margin was $114.9 million, or 18.2% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $150.4 million, or 22.9% of net sales, in 2015. The decrease in gross margin rate was primarily driven by (1) a lower gross profit rate on merchandise sales primarily driven by price reductions needed to maintain the competitiveness of out-of-box product in a more promotional environment for new, in-box appliances, (2) higher occupancy costs due to more Company-operated locations, (3) higher shrink expenses related to $3.7 million of physical inventory charges taken in 2016, and (4) $1.0 million of store closing costs. The total impact of occupancy, shrink, and store closing costs reduced gross margin rate 957 basis points for 2016 compared to a reduction of 645 basis points 2015.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe recorded operating losses of $12.3 million and $26.5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $14.2 million decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of owned property located in San Leandro, California and lower selling and administrative expenses partially offset by lower volume and gross margin.\nHometown results and key statistics were as follows:\nInterest; Fees\nGain on Sale of Assets\nInitial franchise revenues consist of franchise fees paid with respect to new and existing Company-operated stores that we transfer to franchisees plus the net gain or loss on any related transfer of assets to the franchisees. The number of new franchised stores, the number of Company-operated stores transferred, and the net gain or loss per store transferred are variable from quarter to quarter. The variation is driven by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, which influence both the level of new store development and the level of interest of existing or potential franchisees in acquiring store locations, and economic factors specific to our major product categories, such as appliances. Each of these factors impacts the expected returns on new store development and the number of Company-operated locations available for sale to franchisees. Initial franchise revenues were $0.0 million, $(0.2) million, and $0.3 million in the 2017, 2016, and 2015 fiscal years, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company suspended its franchising of additional stores except to existing Company franchisees, and the suspension is continuing.\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $283.3 million, or 24.1% of net sales, in 2017 from $318.6 million, or 22.1% of net sales, in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), lower dealer and franchisee commissions on lower sales volume and lower store counts, and lower marketing expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher IT transformation costs ($22.9 million, or 194 basis points on a rate-to-sales basis, for 2017 compared to $9.9 million, or 69 basis points, for 2016).\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $419.6 million, or 24.4% of net sales, for 2017 from $458.8 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), (2) lower commissions paid to dealers and franchisees on lower sales volume and lower store count, (3) lower marketing costs, and (4) lower support costs paid to Sears Holdings. These decreases were partially offset by (1) higher IT Transformation costs ($34.4 million for 2017 compared to $15.0 for 2016), (2) expenses associated with the 53rd week, (3) $8.1 million higher provisions for 2017 related to franchisee notes receivables, and (4) higher payroll and benefits due to a higher mix of Company-\nOur Hometown stores are designed to provide our customers with in-store and online access to a wide selection of national brands of home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, sporting goods, and household goods, depending on the format. Our Outlet stores are designed to provide our customers with in-store and online access to purchase, at prices that are significantly lower than list prices, new, one-of-a-kind, out-of-carton, discontinued, obsolete, used, reconditioned, overstocked, and scratched and dented products across a broad assortment of merchandise categories, including home appliances, apparel, mattresses, lawn and garden equipment, sporting goods and tools.\n \u2022 EBITDA excludes the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest and depreciation costs; and \nComparable store sales amounts include merchandise sales for all stores operating for a period of at least 12 full months, including remodeled and expanded stores but excluding store relocations and stores that have undergone format changes. In addition, 2017 included an extra week (the \"53rd week\") compared to our 2016 fiscal year results. The 53rd week is not included in comparable store sales calculations.\nIn addition to our net loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), for purposes of evaluating operating performance we also use adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA,\u201d which excludes certain significant items as set forth and discussed below. Our management uses adjusted EBITDA, among other factors, for evaluating the operating performance of our business for comparable periods. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used by investors or other third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as it excludes a number of important cash and non-cash recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP measurements.\nWe account for uncertainties in income taxes according to accounting standards for uncertain tax positions. We are present in a large number of taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time, can have audits underway at various stages of completion in any of these jurisdictions. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law, and closing of statutes of limitation. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, which governs the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to pre-Separation and post-Separation tax matters, Sears Holdings is responsible for any unrecognized tax benefits through the date of the Separation.\nWe recorded an operating loss of $87.4 million and $47.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to the $25.2 million gain on sale of assets in 2016 and lower volume. These factors were partially offset by lower selling and administrative expense, a higher gross margin rate, lower impairment charges, and a $2.3 million favorable impact from the 53rd week.\nThe Company has undertaken an initiative on a limited number of occasions to accelerate the closing of under-performing stores in an effort to improve profitability and make the most productive use of capital. Under-performing stores are typically closed during the normal course of business at the termination of a lease or expiration of a franchise or dealer agreement and, as a result, do not have significant future lease, severance, or other non-recurring store-closing costs. When we close a significant number of stores or close them on an accelerated basis (closing prior to termination or expiration), the Company excludes the associated costs of the closings from adjusted EBITDA. In 2017 and 2016, we excluded $14.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively, of costs associated with the accelerated closure of under-performing stores.\nWe recorded operating losses of $47.7 million and $42.2 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower volume, a lower gross margin rate, higher impairment charges of $9.4 million in 2016 as compared to $4.0 million in 2015, and higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses and a gain on the sale of assets.\nInformation concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contract such as debt and lease agreements and under contingent commitments as of February 3, 2018 is as aggregated in the following table:\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nThe Senior ABL Facility includes customary and other events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross default to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of guarantees or security interests, material judgments, change of control, failure to perform a \"Material Contract\" (which includes the Merchandising Agreement and other SHO-Sears Holdings Agreements) to the extent required to maintain it in full force and effect, the failure to enforce a Material Contract in accordance with its terms, or Sears Holdings terminates the \"Separation Agreements\" (which include, among other SHO-Sears Holdings Agreements, the Merchandising Agreement and the Services Agreements).\nGain on Sale of Asset\n \u2022 it requires assumptions to be made about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and \nNet sales in 2016 decreased $190.7 million, or 11.7%, to $1.4 billion from 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and a 4.2% decrease in comparable store sales. Home appliances, tools, and mattresses outperformed the average comparable store sales while lawn and garden underperformed to the average.\n\nNet sales for 2017 decreased $350.1 million, or 16.9%, to $1.7 billion from $2.1 billion in 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and an 8.4% decrease in comparable store sales. This decline was partially offset by sales of $23.4 million in the 53rd week. Comparable store sales were down 8.1% and 9.1% in Hometown and Outlet, respectively. The home appliances and lawn & garden categories both outperformed the average comparable store sales while tools underperformed to the average.\nNet loss\nRIM inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation, as well as gross margin. The methodologies utilized by SHO in its application of RIM are consistent for all periods presented. Such methodologies include the development of the cost-to-retail ratios, the groupings of homogeneous classes of merchandise, the development of shrinkage and obsolescence reserves, and the accounting for retail price changes. We believe that SHO's RIM provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost. Among others, two significant estimates used in inventory valuation are the level and timing of permanent markdowns (clearance markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow-moving inventory) and shrinkage. Amounts are charged to cost of sales at the time the retail value of inventory is reduced through the use of permanent markdowns.\nSecurity and Guarantees\n\nCash used in operating activities in 2017 was $105.6 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $28.9 million in 2016. Our 2017 cash use was driven by a $52.6 million reduction in payables to Sears Holdings and $34.4 million in IT transformation costs. In 2016 $28.9 million of cash was generated primarily due to a reduction in net inventory investment (inventory less payable). Total merchandise inventories were $336.3 million at February 3, 2018 and $373.8 million at January 29, 2017. Merchandise inventories declined $13.9 million and $23.6 million in Hometown and Outlet, respectively, primarily due to store closures.\nGross Margin\n53 Week Period Ended February 3, 2018 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 -- Hometown\nWe recorded operating losses of $42.3 million and $12.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $30.0 million increase in operating loss was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of assets in 2016 and lower volume, partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses, higher gross margin rates, and a $1.5 million favorable impact from the 53rd week.\nThe Term Loan Agreement includes a number of negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company, the Borrowers, and the Company's other subsidiaries to, subject to exceptions, incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees), grant liens, make investments, make dividends or other distributions with respect to, or repurchase, the Company's capital stock, make prepayments on other indebtedness, engage in mergers, or change the nature of the business. In addition, upon excess availability falling below a specified level or the occurrence of an event of default the Company would be subject to a cash dominion requirement. The Term Loan Agreement also provides that the Borrowers will not permit availability under the Term Loan Agreement and the Senior ABL Facility to be less than 10% of a combined loan cap.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nNet Sales\nGross margin was $246.1 million, or 20.9% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $293.9 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2016. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by lower closing store costs and lower occupancy costs partially offset by lower margin on merchandise sales. The total impact of store closing and occupancy costs decreased gross margin rate 172 basis points for the full year 2017 compared to 260 basis points for the full year 2016.\nOur dealers and franchisees exercise control over the operations of their stores, including complete responsibility for supervising their store management and their store employees and making capital decisions. Several of the primary differences between Company-operated stores and dealer or franchisee-operated stores are that (1) the Company is responsible for occupancy and\npayroll costs associated with Company-operated stores while our dealers and franchisees are responsible for these costs for their stores, (2) the Company is responsible for all terms and conditions of employment for the employees in the Company-operated stores and our dealers and franchisees are responsible for all terms and conditions of employment for the employees in their stores, and (3) we pay commissions to our dealers and franchisees.\nThe Term Loan is subject to mandatory prepayment in amounts equal to the amount by which the outstanding Term Loan exceeds the borrowing base specified in the Term Loan Agreement plus a reserve to be maintained against the borrowing base for the Senior ABL Facility (the push-down reserve\u201d), which reserve will be equal to total outstandings under the Term Loan Agreement that exceed the Term Loan Agreement's borrowing base, if such excess were to arise. The Company may not reborrow amounts prepaid.\nWe recorded a net loss of $131.9 million for 2016 compared to a net loss of $27.3 million for 2015. The increase in our net loss was primarily attributable to a higher operating loss, including store-closing costs, and an increase in income tax expense.\nPrepayments\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $318.6 million, or 22.1% of net sales, in 2016 from $378.1 million, or 23.2% of net sales, in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of (1) lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), (2) lower dealer and franchisee commissions on lower sales volume, (3) converting some dealer and franchisee locations to Company-operated stores in 2016, which resulted in some costs previously recorded as selling and administrative expenses to be recorded as a reduction to gross margin, and (4) a $12.7 million charge in 2015 related to expenses for uncollectible franchise notes receivable. The Company recorded $0.9 million of selling and administrative expenses related to store closings for 2016. IT Transformation costs were $9.9 million for 2016 compared to $7.4 million for 2015. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT Transformation costs and charges related to franchise notes receivable increased selling and administrative expenses 64 basis points and 123 basis points for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nUses and Sources of Liquidity\nSenior ABL Facility\nPrepayments\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $348.5 million, or 20.3% of net sales, for 2017 compared to $408.7 million, or 19.7% of net sales, for 2016. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by higher margin on merchandise sales and lower shrink partially offset by higher occupancy costs as a percentage of sales resulting from a greater mix of Company-operated stores compared to the prior year. Accelerated store closing costs were $14.2 million for 2017 compared to $15.7 million for 2016. The total impact of occupancy costs, accelerated closing store costs, and shrink reduced gross margin rate 496 basis points for 2017 compared to a 490 basis-point reduction for 2016.\nThe Senior ABL Facility is secured by a first lien security interest on substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles, investment property, equipment, cash, cash equivalents, deposit accounts and securities accounts, as well as certain other assets (other than intellectual property and fee-owned interests in real property) ancillary to any of the foregoing and all proceeds of any of the foregoing, including cash proceeds and the proceeds of applicable insurance. The Senior ABL Facility is guaranteed by the Company and each of its existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (other than specified immaterial subsidiaries).\nThe foregoing factors should not be understood as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements, including the \"Risk Factors,\" that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our other public announcements. While we believe that our forecasts and assumptions are reasonable, we caution that actual results may differ materially. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what we projected. Consequently, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are made only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf, whether as a result of new information, future developments, subsequent events or circumstances, or otherwise, except as required by law.\nHistorically, all of the Company's Outlet stores were operated by the Company. We initiated efforts to franchise Outlet stores in 2012, with the first stores transferred to franchisees during the 2013 fiscal year. During the second quarter of 2015 the Company suspended its franchising of additional stores except to existing Company franchisees, and the suspension is continuing. As of February 3, 2018, 11 of the 132 Sears Outlet stores were operated by franchisees.\nThe Term Loan Agreement also contains affirmative covenants including, among others, financial and other reporting and notification requirements, maintenance of properties, inspection rights, and physical inventories. The Company and the Borrowers also agree that the Company and the Borrowers will cause the push-down reserve to be established and maintained when and if required by the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement borrowing base generally means specified amounts of credit card receivables and inventory (net of reserves), minus the loan cap for the Senior ABL Facility and availability reserves.\nGross margin was $293.9 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $368.1 million, or 22.6% of net sales, in 2015. The decrease in gross margin rate was primarily driven by (1) $15.1 million of store-closing costs, (2) lower margin on merchandise sales, (3) higher occupancy costs due to an increase in the number of Company-operated stores, and (4) higher shrink due to $4.6 million of physical inventory gains in 2015. The total impact of occupancy, store-closing costs, and shrink reduced gross margin rate 285 basis points for 2016 compared to a reduction of 124 basis points for 2015.\nInterest; Fees\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMerchandise Subsidies and Cash Discounts from Sears Holdings\nFinancing Arrangements\nNet Sales\nThe Senior ABL Facility includes a number of negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the guarantors) to, subject to certain exceptions, incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees), grant liens, make investments, make prepayments on other indebtedness, and engage in mergers or change the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the guarantors). In addition, upon excess availability falling below a specified level the Company would be subject to a cash dominion requirement and more frequent borrowing base reporting requirements. The Senior ABL Facility also limits SHO's ability to declare and pay cash dividends and to repurchase its common stock. The Senior ABL Facility would not have permitted us to pay cash dividends or to repurchase our common stock as of February 3, 2018. The Senior ABL Facility also contains affirmative covenants, including financial and other reporting requirements.\nIn the normal course of business, stores can transition from Company-operated to franchisee or dealer-operated, and vice-versa. Potential new store locations may be identified by the Company, an existing dealer or franchisee, or a potential dealer or franchisee. If the Company identifies and develops a location, it will generally seek to transfer that store to a dealer. When the Company takes back a store from a franchisee, the Company's gross margin will generally decrease as the our cost of occupancy, which is reflected in cost of sales and occupancy will increase. In addition, the Company's selling and administrative expense will decrease as the Company's commission payments, which are reflected in selling and administrative expense, will decrease. The decrease in commission payments will be partially offset by higher payroll and benefits expense.\nThe Term Loan Agreement is secured by a second lien security interest (subordinate only to the liens securing the Senior ABL Facility) on substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (the same assets as the assets specified with respect to the Senior ABL Facility), including without limitation accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles, investment property, equipment, cash, cash equivalents, deposit accounts and securities accounts, as well as other assets (other than intellectual property and fee-owned interests in real property) ancillary to any of the foregoing and all proceeds of any of the foregoing, including cash proceeds and the proceeds of applicable insurance. The Term Loan Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and each of its existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (other than specified immaterial subsidiaries).\nWe obtain our merchandise through agreements with subsidiaries of Sears Holdings and with other vendors. Merchandise acquired from subsidiaries of Sears Holdings (including Kenmore, Craftsman, DieHard, and other merchandise) accounted for approximately 78% and 80% of total purchases of all inventory from all vendors for 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect the percentage of total purchases of inventory acquired from subsidiaries of Sears Holdings to decrease in the future as we increase our direct purchases from other merchandise vendors. Fourth quarter 2017 purchases from Sears Holdings accounted for 74% of total purchases compared to 84% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 76% in the third quarter of 2017. The loss of, or a material reduction in, the amount of merchandise made available to us by Sears Holdings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nNet Sales\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million.\nNet loss\nGross margin was $102.4 million, or 18.9% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $114.9 million, or 18.2% of net sales, in 2016. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by a higher gross profit rate on merchandise sales primarily driven by new pricing strategies and renegotiated merchandise costs and lower shrink expenses. These increases were partially offset by flat occupancy costs, but higher on a rate-to-sales basis, and higher store closings costs ($7.6 million for 2017 compared to $1.0 million for 2016). The total impact of store closing costs, occupancy costs and shrink was a reduction to gross margin rate of 1,131 basis points for 2017 compared to 957 basis points for 2016.\nOperating Loss\nWe had $10.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of February 3, 2018 and $14.1 million as of January 28, 2017.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in \"Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking and Other Information.\"\nSecurity and Guarantees\n52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 30, 2016\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING AND OTHER INFORMATION\n53 Week Period Ended February 3, 2018 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 -- Outlet\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing the financial statements, certain accounting policies require considerable judgment to select the appropriate assumptions to calculate financial estimates. These estimates are complex and subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our estimates on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, evaluation of trends and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Although the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the financial statements, we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\nWe believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and the considerations used in estimating amounts, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n \u2022 713 Hometown Stores-Primarily independently operated stores, predominantly located in smaller communities, and offering home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, sporting goods, and household goods. All of our Hometown Stores carry proprietary Sears-branded products, such as Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard, as well as a wide assortment of other national brands. \nOutlet\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $140.2 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016 compared to $168.0 million, or 25.5% of net sales, for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower franchisee commissions on lower sales volumes, converting some franchisee locations to Company-operated stores in 2016 (which resulted in some costs previously recorded as selling and administrative expenses being recorded as a reduction to gross margin), and $12.7 million of provisions for franchisee note receivables in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by higher payroll and benefits costs resulting from a higher number of Company-operated stores. The Company recorded $0.1 million of store-closing selling and administrative expenses for 2016. IT Transformation costs were $5.1 million for 2016 compared to $3.5 million for 2015. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT Transformation costs and charges related to franchise notes receivable increased selling and administrative expense 80 basis points and 247 basis points for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the forward looking statements\u201d).

See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a listing of our other significant accounting policies.\nIncome Taxes\nOperating Loss\narising out of failure to comply with contractual obligations); our reliance on Sears Holdings to provide computer systems to process transactions with our customers (including the point-of-sale system for the stores we operate and the stores that our independent dealers and independent franchisees operate, which point-of-sale system captures, among other things, credit-card information supplied by our customers) and others, quantify our results of operations, and manage our business (\"SHO's SHC-Supplied Systems\"); SHO's SHC-Supplied Systems could be subject to disruptions and data/security breaches (Sears Holdings announced on May 31, 2017 that its Kmart store payment-data systems had been infected with a malicious code and that the code had been removed and the event contained and on April 4, 2018 Sears Holdings announced that one of its vendors that provides online support services to Sears and Kmart had notified Sears Holdings that the vendor had experienced a security incident during 2017 that involved unauthorized access to credit card information with respect to less than 100,000 Sears Holdings's customers), and Sears Holdings could be unwilling or unable to indemnify and defend us against third-party claims and other losses resulting from such disruptions and data/security breaches, which could have one or more material adverse effects on SHO; our ability to implement the BPO in accordance with our plans, expectations, current timetable, and anticipated cost; limitations and restrictions in the Senior ABL Facility and the Term Loan Agreement and their related agreements governing our indebtedness and our ability to service our indebtedness; competitors could continue to reduce their promotional pricing on new-in-box appliances, which could continue to adversely impact our sales of out-of-box appliances and associated margin; our ability to generate profitable sales of merchandise and services on our transactional ecommerce websites in the amounts we have planned to generate; our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms; our dependence on the ability and willingness of our independent dealers and independent franchisees to operate their stores profitably and in a manner consistent with our concepts and standards; our ability to sell profitably online all of our merchandise and services; our dependence on sources outside the U.S. for significant amounts of our merchandise inventories; fixed-asset impairment for long-lived assets; our ability to attract, motivate, and retain key executives and other employees; our ability to maintain effective internal controls as a publicly held company; our ability to realize the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Separation; litigation and regulatory trends challenging various aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship could expand to challenge or adversely affect our relationships with our independent dealers and independent franchisees; low trading volume of our common stock due to limited liquidity or a lack of analyst coverage; and the impact on our common stock and our overall performance as a result of our principal stockholder's ability to exert control over us.\nIncome Taxes\nFranchisee Receivables Charges\nIn October 2012 the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, including Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, which provided (subject to availability under a borrowing base) for aggregate maximum borrowings of $250 million (the \"Prior Facility\"). Under the Prior Facility the Company initially borrowed $100 million which was used to pay a cash dividend to Sears Holdings prior to the Separation. On November 1, 2016 the Company's three operating subsidiaries, Sears Authorized Hometown Stores, LLC, Sears Home Appliance Showrooms, LLC, and Sears Outlet Stores, L.L.C., and the Company, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (which amended and restated the Prior Facility) with a syndicate of lenders, including Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, which provides (subject to availability under a borrowing base) for aggregate maximum borrowings of $250 million (the \"Senior ABL Facility\"). The Senior ABL Facility provides for extended revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount equal to $170 million (the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments\u201d) and non-extended revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount equal to $80 million (the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments\u201d). The Extended Revolving Credit Commitments will mature on the earlier of (1) February 29, 2020 and (2) six months prior to the expiration of agreements entered into with Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries\nSince 2015 the Company has excluded initial franchise revenues from adjusted EBITDA. This change is based on (1) the Company's decision to suspend its franchising of additional stores except to existing Company franchisees and (2) to better align adjusted EBITDA for purposes of incentive compensation.", "item_7_text": "Net sales for 2016 decreased $217.7 million, or 9.5%, to $2.1 billion compared to 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and a 4.4% decrease in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales were down 4.2% and 4.9% in Hometown and Outlet, respectively. The home appliances and tools categories both outperformed the average comparable store sales while lawn and garden and mattresses underperformed the average.\nOperating Loss\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, if any. As further described above, we consider estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Our actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and our forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Although we believe current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from our operating activities, and, to the extent necessary, availability under the Senior ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. As a result, we expect to fund our ongoing operations through existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operating activities, and with funds available under the Senior ABL Facility. The adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment and the operating performance of our stores. See for example \"If Sears Holdings' seeks the protection of the U.S. bankruptcy laws, our ability to operate our business and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nGross margin was $408.7 million, or 19.7% of net sales, for 2016 compared to $518.5 million, or 22.7% of net sales, for 2015. The decrease in gross margin rate was primarily driven by higher occupancy costs due to more Company-operated locations, lower margin on merchandise sales, $15.7 million of store-closing costs, and $8.5 million higher shrink resulting from $3.7 million physical inventory charges in Outlet in 2016 as compared to $4.6 million of physical inventory gains in Hometown in 2015. The total impact of occupancy costs, accelerated store-closing costs, and shrink reduced gross margin rate 490 basis points for 2016 compared to a reduction of 274 basis points for 2015.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nCash Balances\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company had a provision for collectability (net of recoveries) related to franchisee receivables of $7.4 million in 2017 compared to net recoveries of $0.8 million in 2016 and $25.4 million net expense in 2015.\nDuring 2017 we financed our operations and investments with cash generated from financing activities. Our primary liquidity needs are for funding inventory purchases, our IT transformation, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.\nWe recorded a net loss of $95.1 million for 2017 compared to a net loss of $131.9 million for 2016. The decrease in our net loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in income tax expense partially offset by a higher operating loss and higher interest expense.\nCosts related to and incurred for the Term Loan totaled approximately $1.0 million.\nReserve for Losses on Franchisee Receivables\nThe Tax Act also establishes new tax laws that will affect fiscal 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate; (2) the elimination of corporate AMT; (3) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (4) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (5) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; and (6) limitations on net operating losses (NOLs) generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, to 80% of taxable income. The estimated impact of the new tax law on the Company's financial statements and the related accounting requirements are discussed in Note 5.\nOur fiscal years end on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to specific years in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to fiscal years. The following fiscal periods are presented herein:\n \u2022 Other significant items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and may have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of results. These items may also include cash charges such as severance and executive transition costs and IT transformation investments that make it difficult for investors to assess the Company's core operating performance. \nEvents of Default\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $136.3 million, or 25.1% of net sales, for 2017 compared to $140.2 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower franchisee commissions on lower sales volumes and lower store counts, lower expenses being recorded for stores closed and lower marketing expense. These reductions were partially offset by $7.6 million higher provisions for franchisee receivables, higher IT transformation costs ($11.5 million for 2017 compared to $5.1 million for 2016), and expenses associated with the 53rd week. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT transformation costs and provisions for franchisee note receivables increased selling and administrative expense 351 basis points for 2017 compared to 80 basis points for 2016.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nCustomary fees are payable in respect of the Senior ABL Facility, including letter of credit fees and commitment fees.\n \u2022 36 Home Appliance Showrooms-Stores that have a simple, primarily appliance showroom design that are located in metropolitan areas. \nWhile adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, we believe it is an important indicator of operating performance for investors because:\nOur inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined under the retail inventory method, or \"RIM,\" using primarily a last-in, first-out, or \"LIFO,\" cost-flow assumption. To determine inventory cost under RIM, inventory at its retail selling value is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics, which are then converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each grouping of merchandise. Cost factors represent the average cost-to-retail ratio for each merchandise group based upon the year's purchasing activity for each store location. Accordingly, a significant assumption under the retail method is that inventory in each group is similar in terms of its cost-to-retail relationship and has similar turnover rates. We monitor the content of merchandise in these groupings to prevent distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation.\nWe recorded operating losses of $45.1 million and $35.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in our operating loss was primarily due to lower volume partially offset by reduced selling and administrative expense, a higher gross margin rate, lower impairment charges, and a $0.8 million favorable impact from the 53rd week.\nThe principal terms of the Term Loan Agreement are summarized below.\nCovenants\n52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 30, 2016 -- Hometown\nOperating Loss\nOutlet results and key statistics were as follows:\noperated stores. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT transformation costs and provisions for franchisee note receivables increased selling and administrative expenses 243 basis points for 2017 compared to 69 basis points for 2016.\nCovenants\nIn addition, our merchandise-vendor arrangements generally are not long-term agreements and none of them guarantees the availability of merchandise inventory in the future. Our growth strategy depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with sufficient merchandise inventory. As a result, our success depends on maintaining good relations with our existing vendors and on developing relationships with new vendors, especially with respect to merchandise inventory to be sold by Outlet. If we fail to maintain our relations with our existing vendors or to maintain the quality of merchandise inventory they supply to us, or if we cannot maintain or acquire new vendors of favored brand-name merchandise inventory, and if we cannot acquire new vendors of merchandise inventory to be sold by Outlet, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise at acceptable prices may be limited, which would have a negative impact on our competitive position. In addition, merchandise inventory acquired from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality and more expensive than the merchandise inventory that we currently purchase. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTerm Loan Agreement\n52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 30, 2016 -- Outlet\n\nOur deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management has determined a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets is still necessary as of February 3, 2018. For the current year the valuation allowance decreased by $8.5 million to an ending balance of $92.4 million. The decrease in the valuation allowance is mainly attributable to the reduction in the federal tax rate but also includes a tax benefit of $0.8 million due to the valuation allowance release for the reclassification of the AMT DTA. In the future, we may record additional net deferred tax assets and if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain, we may record additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income (loss), the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income.\nThe Senior ABL Facility is subject to mandatory prepayment in amounts equal to the amount by which the outstanding extensions of credit exceed the lesser of the borrowing base and the commitments then in effect.\nGross Margin\nThe interest rate applicable to the Term Loan under the Term Loan Agreement is a fluctuating rate of interest (payable and adjusted monthly) equal to the greater of (1) three-month LIBOR plus 8.5% per annum and (2) a minimum interest rate of 9.5% per annum. Customary fees are payable in respect of the Term Loan Agreement, including a commitment fee and an early prepayment fee.\nValuation of Inventory\nGross Margin\nThe principal terms of the Senior ABL Facility are summarized below.\n53 Week Period Ended February 3, 2018 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017\nAs of February 3, 2018 we had $137.9 million outstanding under the Senior ABL Facility, which approximated the fair value of these borrowings. Up to $75 million of the Senior ABL Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25 million is available for swingline loans. The Senior ABL Facility permits us to request commitment increases in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million. Availability under the Senior ABL Facility as of February 3, 2018 was $24.9 million, with $7.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility.\nThe following factors, among others, (1) could cause our actual results, performance, and achievements to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and one or more of the differences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and (2) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows: if Sears Holdings seeks the protection of the U.S. bankruptcy laws (including the effects of the imposition of the \"automatic stay\" and the effects if Sears Holdings were to seek to reject one or more of the SHO-Sears Holdings Agreements);

on March 9, 2017 Sears Holdings announced the Stanley Purchase (Sears Holdings has waived its right in the Amended and Restated Merchandising Agreement to terminate, as a result of the Stanley Purchase, the Company's rights to buy from Sears Holdings merchandise branded with the Craftsman brand); on July 20, 2017 Sears Holdings announced the launch of Kenmore products on Amazon.com and that Sears Holdings planned to expand the full line of Kenmore home appliances available on Amazon.com; on August 22, 2017 Sears Holdings announced licensing agreements with third parties to manufacture and distribute Kenmore floor care products and DieHard batteries and flashlights;

competitive conditions in the retail industry; worldwide economic conditions and business uncertainty, the availability of consumer and commercial credit, changes in consumer confidence, tastes, preferences and spending, and changes in vendor relationships; the fact that our past performance generally, as reflected on our historical financial statements, may not be indicative of our future performance as a result of, among other things, the impact of increased costs due to a decrease in our purchasing power following the Separation, and other losses of benefits associated with having been wholly owned by Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries prior to the Separation; our continuing reliance on Sears Holdings for most products and services that are important to the successful operation of our business, and our potential need to rely on Sears Holdings for some products and services beyond the expiration, or earlier termination by Sears Holdings, of our agreements with Sears Holdings; the willingness of Sears Holdings' appliance, lawn and garden, tools, and other vendors to continue to supply to Sears Holdings on terms (including vendor-payment terms for Sears Holdings' merchandise purchases) that are acceptable to it (which vendor-payment terms, we believe, are becoming, and in the future could continue to become, increasingly uneconomic for Sears Holdings) and to us, merchandise that we would need to purchase from Sears Holdings to ensure continuity of merchandise supplies for our businesses; the willingness of Sears Holdings' appliance, lawn and garden, tools, and other vendors to continue to pay to Sears Holdings merchandise-related subsidies and allowances and cash discounts (some of which Sears Holdings is obligated to pay to us); our ability to resolve, on commercially reasonable terms, future disputes with Sears Holdings regarding the material terms and conditions of our agreements with Sears Holdings; our ability to establish information, merchandising, logistics, and other systems separate from Sears Holdings that would be necessary to ensure continuity of merchandise supplies and services for our businesses if vendors were to reduce, or cease, their merchandise sales to Sears Holdings or provide logistics and other services to Sears Holdings or if Sears Holdings were to reduce, or cease, its merchandise sales to us or reduce providing, or cease to provide, logistics and other services to us; if Sears Holdings' sales of major appliances and lawn and garden merchandise to its retail customers decline Sears Holdings' sales to us of outlet-value merchandise could decline; our ability to maintain an effective and productive business relationship with Sears Holdings, particularly if future disputes were to arise with respect to the terms and conditions of our agreements with Sears Holdings; most of our agreements related to the Separation and our continuing relationship with Sears Holdings were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Sears Holdings (except for amendments agreed to after the Separation), and we may have received different terms from unaffiliated third parties (including with respect to merchandise-vendor and service-provider indemnification and defense for negligence claims and claims\nNet Sales\nOperating Loss\nIncome tax expense was $81.5 million in 2016, comprised primarily of a $100.1 million non-cash valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, and a benefit of $15.2 million in 2015. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K for further information.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million. We did not sell any owned property in fiscal 2017.\nThe Company recognizes a reserve for losses on franchisee receivables (which consist primarily of franchisee promissory notes) in an amount equal to estimated probable losses net of recoveries. The reserve is based on an analysis of expected future write-offs, existing economic conditions, and an assessment of specific identifiable franchisee promissory notes and other franchisee receivables considered at risk or uncollectible. The expense associated with the reserve for losses on franchisee receivables is recognized as selling and administrative expense. Most of our franchisee promissory notes authorize us to deduct debt service from our commissions otherwise due and payable to the franchisees, and we routinely make those deductions to the extent of available commissions payable. The reserve for losses on franchisee receivables is evaluated based on our receivable-by-receivable assessment during the year that loan balances would be potentially uncollectible in future periods due to declining results of operations of, or other adverse financial events with respect to, franchise stores that indicated that the franchisees might not be able to meet their debt-service and other obligations to us as they became due. During fiscal 2017 we forgave balances due on franchisee receivables in accordance with negotiated franchise-termination agreements, and as part of these transactions, the Company purchased store furniture, fixtures, and equipment from franchisees.\nHome Office Overhead Allocation\nNet Sales\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 19 Hardware Stores-Hardware stores that offer primarily home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and other home improvement products, and featuring Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard, as well as a wide assortment of other national brands. \nGain on Sale of Assets\nThe Term Loan Agreement includes customary events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, cross default to the Senior ABL Facility and other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of the Term Loan Agreement and the other related loan documents (including the guarantees or security interests provided therein), material judgments, and change of control.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nGross Margin\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nNet Sales\nAs of February 3, 2018, Hometown consisted of 768 stores as follows:\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nFactors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise, fashion and design trends and weather conditions. In addition, inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre-determined historical markdown cadences. When a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise, the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded. The timing of the decision, particularly surrounding the balance sheet date, can have a significant effect on the results of operations.\nBusiness Segment Results\n\nWe recorded operating losses of $35.3 million and $15.6 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in our operating loss was primarily attributable to lower volume, lower gross margin rate, higher impairment charges, and higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in selling and administration expenses.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $458.8 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016 from $546.1 million, or 23.9% of net sales, for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) lower commissions paid to dealers and franchisees on lower sales volume, (2) the conversion of some dealer and franchisee locations to Company-operated stores in 2016, which resulted in some costs previously recorded as selling and administrative expenses to be recorded as a reduction to gross margin, (3) lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), and (4) a $25.4 million charge in 2015 related to the write-off of, and additional reserves taken on, franchisee notes receivables. The Company recorded $1.0 million of store closing selling and administrative expenses for 2016. IT Transformation costs were $15.0 million for 2016 compared to $10.9 million for 2015. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT Transformation costs and charges related to franchise notes receivable increased selling and administrative expenses 69 basis points and 159 basis points for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nComparable Store Sales\n\nIncome tax expense was $0.5 million for 2017 compared to $81.5 million for 2016, comprised primarily of $100.1 million non-cash valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets recorded in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act reduces the corporate rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The impact on our net deferred tax assets (\"DTA\") and deferred tax liabilities (\"DTL\") was a decrease of $35.2 million with a corresponding net adjustment to the valuation allowance for the year ended February 3, 2018.\nNet sales in 2016 decreased $27.0 million, or 4.1%, to $630.5 million from 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by a 4.9% decrease in comparable store sales, partially offset by the impact of new stores (net of closings). Home appliances, tools, and furniture outperformed the average comparable store sales while apparel, mattresses and lawn and garden underperformed to the average.\nThe following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated results of operations for our 2017, 2016 and 2015 fiscal years.\nCapital lease obligations were $0.6 million and $0.5 million as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively.\nSince the Separation we have included an allocation of Home Office overhead expenses in selling and administrative expenses from Hometown and Outlet. Home Office overhead expenses are primarily comprised of corporate headquarters payroll, benefits, and other costs and include charges related to our Services Agreement with Sears Holdings.\nHometown\nIn accordance with our Amended and Restated Merchandising Agreement with Sears Holdings, SHO receives from Sears Holdings specified portions of merchandise subsidies collected by Sears Holdings from its merchandise vendors and specified portions of cash discounts earned by Sears Holdings as a result of its early payment of merchandise-vendor payables (together \"Vendor Funds\"). For 2017 Sears Holdings' Vendor Funds were higher compared to 2016 and SHO's portion of the collected Vendor Funds during 2017 were approximately $5.2 million higher than SHO's portion for 2016. While we cannot provide any assurance that SHO's portion of Vendor Funds collected by Sears Holdings will not decline, stay the same, or continue to increase, our portion could decline in 2018 due to an expected increase in purchases through our direct vendor relationships. If SHO's portion of Vendor Funds collected by Sears Holdings were to decline significantly, SHO's results of operations could be adversely affected to a material extent.\nEvents of Default\nIn accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, Sears Holdings is responsible for any federal, state or foreign income tax liability relating to tax periods ending on or before the Separation.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAs of February 3, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.4 million.\nFiscal Year\nWe are a national retailer primarily focused on selling home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and hardware. In addition to merchandise, we provide our customers with access to a full suite of related services, including home delivery, installation, and extended-service plans. As of February 3, 2018, we and our independent dealers and franchisees operated a total of 900 stores across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda. In fiscal year 2017, the Company opened 7 stores and closed 127 stores.\nGain on Sale of Asset\nNet sales in 2017 decreased $262.3 million, or 18.2%, to $1.2 billion from $1.4 billion in 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and a 8.1% decrease in comparable store sales. This decline was partially offset by sales of $13.9 million of sales in the 53rd week. Home appliances and lawn and garden outperformed the average comparable store sales while tools and mattresses underperformed to the average.\nin connection with the Company's separation from Sears Holdings in October 2012 (the \"Subject Agreements\") unless they are extended to a date later than February 29, 2020 or terminated on a basis reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent under the Senior ABL Facility. The Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments were not extended by the Non-Extending Lenders in accordance with the Senior ABL Facility and matured on October 11, 2017. Unamortized debt costs related to the Senior ABL Facility of $3.5 million are included in Prepaid and Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 3, 2018 and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Senior ABL Facility.\nSubsequent to year-end, on February 16, 2018 the Company's three operating subsidiaries, Sears Authorized Hometown Stores, LLC, Sears Home Appliance Showrooms, LLC, and Sears Outlet Stores, L.L.C., as borrowers, and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Gordon Brothers Finance Company, as agent, lead arranger, and sole bookrunner, and Gordon Brothers Finance Company, LLC as lender (the Term Loan Agreement\u201d). The Term Loan Agreement provides for a $40 million term loan (the Term Loan\u201d), which amount the Company has borrowed, and is outstanding, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Agreement. The Company used the proceeds of the Term Loan to pay down borrowings under the Senior ABL Facility. The Term Loan will mature on the earliest of (1) the maturity date specified in the Senior ABL Facility, (2) February 16, 2023, and (3) acceleration of the maturity date following an event of default in accordance with the Term Loan Agreement.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that will affect our fiscal year ending February 3, 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, (2) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, and (3) various other miscellaneous changes that are effective in fiscal 2017. The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% in the fiscal year ending February 3, 2018. Based on Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code, our fiscal year ending February 3, 2018 will have a blended corporate tax rate of 33.72%, which is based on the applicable tax rates before and after the Tax Act and the number of days in the year.\nCash used in investing activities was $9.2 million in 2017 compared to cash provided of $13.9 million in 2016. In the second quarter of 2016 we received proceeds of $26.1 million from the sale of assets.\nAs of February 3, 2018, our Hometown segment included 707 dealer-operated stores, 32 franchisee-operated stores, and 29 Company-operated stores. The business model and economic structure of the dealer-operated and franchisee-operated stores, which are independently owned, are substantially similar to Company-operated stores in many respects. The Company requires all of the stores to operate under specified circumstances according to the Company's standards. Stores must display the required merchandise, offer all required products and services, and use the Company's point of sale system. Also, the Company has the right to approve advertising and promotional and marketing materials and imposes specified advertising requirements on the owners. The Company owns the merchandise, establishes all selling prices for the merchandise, and bears general inventory risk (with specific exceptions) until sale of the merchandise and if the customer returns the merchandise. In addition, because each transaction is recorded in the Company's point of sale system, the Company bears customer credit risk. The Company establishes a commission structure for stores operated by our dealers and franchisees and pays commissions when our dealers and franchisees sell the merchandise and provide services.\nOverview\nCash provided by financing activities was $111.2 million for 2017 compared to cash used in financing activities of $46.9 million for 2016. The increase of $158.1 million in cash provided by financing activities in 2017 from 2016 was primarily due to greater net borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility in 2017.\nNet sales in 2017 decreased $87.8 million, or 13.9%, to $542.7 million from 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by a 9.1% decrease in comparable store sales and closed stores (net of new store openings) partially offset by $9.5 million in the 53rd week. Lawn and garden, furniture and mattresses outperformed the average comparable store sales while home appliances, tools, and apparel underperformed to the average.\nGross Margin\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOperating Loss\n \u2022 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or different estimates that could have been selected would have a material effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. \nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Senior ABL Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at the Company's election, either (1) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a borrowing margin ranging from (x) 3.50% to 4.50%, in the case of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or (y) 2.00% to 2.50%, in the case of the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (which the blended rate was approximately 5.02% at February 3, 2018 and 3.94% at January 28, 2017), and in each case based on availability under the Senior ABL Facility, or (2) an alternate base rate plus a borrowing margin, ranging from (x) 2.50% to 3.50%, in the case of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or (y) 1.00% to 1.50%, in the case of the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (which the blended rate was approximately 8.00% at February 3, 2018 and 5.94% at January 28, 2017), and in each case based on availability under the Senior ABL Facility.\nGross margin was $114.9 million, or 18.2% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $150.4 million, or 22.9% of net sales, in 2015. The decrease in gross margin rate was primarily driven by (1) a lower gross profit rate on merchandise sales primarily driven by price reductions needed to maintain the competitiveness of out-of-box product in a more promotional environment for new, in-box appliances, (2) higher occupancy costs due to more Company-operated locations, (3) higher shrink expenses related to $3.7 million of physical inventory charges taken in 2016, and (4) $1.0 million of store closing costs. The total impact of occupancy, shrink, and store closing costs reduced gross margin rate 957 basis points for 2016 compared to a reduction of 645 basis points 2015.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe recorded operating losses of $12.3 million and $26.5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $14.2 million decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of owned property located in San Leandro, California and lower selling and administrative expenses partially offset by lower volume and gross margin.\nHometown results and key statistics were as follows:\nInterest; Fees\nGain on Sale of Assets\nInitial franchise revenues consist of franchise fees paid with respect to new and existing Company-operated stores that we transfer to franchisees plus the net gain or loss on any related transfer of assets to the franchisees. The number of new franchised stores, the number of Company-operated stores transferred, and the net gain or loss per store transferred are variable from quarter to quarter. The variation is driven by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, which influence both the level of new store development and the level of interest of existing or potential franchisees in acquiring store locations, and economic factors specific to our major product categories, such as appliances. Each of these factors impacts the expected returns on new store development and the number of Company-operated locations available for sale to franchisees. Initial franchise revenues were $0.0 million, $(0.2) million, and $0.3 million in the 2017, 2016, and 2015 fiscal years, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company suspended its franchising of additional stores except to existing Company franchisees, and the suspension is continuing.\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $283.3 million, or 24.1% of net sales, in 2017 from $318.6 million, or 22.1% of net sales, in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), lower dealer and franchisee commissions on lower sales volume and lower store counts, and lower marketing expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher IT transformation costs ($22.9 million, or 194 basis points on a rate-to-sales basis, for 2017 compared to $9.9 million, or 69 basis points, for 2016).\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $419.6 million, or 24.4% of net sales, for 2017 from $458.8 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), (2) lower commissions paid to dealers and franchisees on lower sales volume and lower store count, (3) lower marketing costs, and (4) lower support costs paid to Sears Holdings. These decreases were partially offset by (1) higher IT Transformation costs ($34.4 million for 2017 compared to $15.0 for 2016), (2) expenses associated with the 53rd week, (3) $8.1 million higher provisions for 2017 related to franchisee notes receivables, and (4) higher payroll and benefits due to a higher mix of Company-\nOur Hometown stores are designed to provide our customers with in-store and online access to a wide selection of national brands of home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, sporting goods, and household goods, depending on the format. Our Outlet stores are designed to provide our customers with in-store and online access to purchase, at prices that are significantly lower than list prices, new, one-of-a-kind, out-of-carton, discontinued, obsolete, used, reconditioned, overstocked, and scratched and dented products across a broad assortment of merchandise categories, including home appliances, apparel, mattresses, lawn and garden equipment, sporting goods and tools.\n \u2022 EBITDA excludes the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest and depreciation costs; and \nComparable store sales amounts include merchandise sales for all stores operating for a period of at least 12 full months, including remodeled and expanded stores but excluding store relocations and stores that have undergone format changes. In addition, 2017 included an extra week (the \"53rd week\") compared to our 2016 fiscal year results. The 53rd week is not included in comparable store sales calculations.\nIn addition to our net loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), for purposes of evaluating operating performance we also use adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA,\u201d which excludes certain significant items as set forth and discussed below. Our management uses adjusted EBITDA, among other factors, for evaluating the operating performance of our business for comparable periods. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used by investors or other third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as it excludes a number of important cash and non-cash recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP measurements.\nWe account for uncertainties in income taxes according to accounting standards for uncertain tax positions. We are present in a large number of taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time, can have audits underway at various stages of completion in any of these jurisdictions. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law, and closing of statutes of limitation. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, which governs the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to pre-Separation and post-Separation tax matters, Sears Holdings is responsible for any unrecognized tax benefits through the date of the Separation.\nWe recorded an operating loss of $87.4 million and $47.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to the $25.2 million gain on sale of assets in 2016 and lower volume. These factors were partially offset by lower selling and administrative expense, a higher gross margin rate, lower impairment charges, and a $2.3 million favorable impact from the 53rd week.\nThe Company has undertaken an initiative on a limited number of occasions to accelerate the closing of under-performing stores in an effort to improve profitability and make the most productive use of capital. Under-performing stores are typically closed during the normal course of business at the termination of a lease or expiration of a franchise or dealer agreement and, as a result, do not have significant future lease, severance, or other non-recurring store-closing costs. When we close a significant number of stores or close them on an accelerated basis (closing prior to termination or expiration), the Company excludes the associated costs of the closings from adjusted EBITDA. In 2017 and 2016, we excluded $14.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively, of costs associated with the accelerated closure of under-performing stores.\nWe recorded operating losses of $47.7 million and $42.2 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower volume, a lower gross margin rate, higher impairment charges of $9.4 million in 2016 as compared to $4.0 million in 2015, and higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses and a gain on the sale of assets.\nInformation concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contract such as debt and lease agreements and under contingent commitments as of February 3, 2018 is as aggregated in the following table:\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nThe Senior ABL Facility includes customary and other events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross default to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of guarantees or security interests, material judgments, change of control, failure to perform a \"Material Contract\" (which includes the Merchandising Agreement and other SHO-Sears Holdings Agreements) to the extent required to maintain it in full force and effect, the failure to enforce a Material Contract in accordance with its terms, or Sears Holdings terminates the \"Separation Agreements\" (which include, among other SHO-Sears Holdings Agreements, the Merchandising Agreement and the Services Agreements).\nGain on Sale of Asset\n \u2022 it requires assumptions to be made about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and \nNet sales in 2016 decreased $190.7 million, or 11.7%, to $1.4 billion from 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and a 4.2% decrease in comparable store sales. Home appliances, tools, and mattresses outperformed the average comparable store sales while lawn and garden underperformed to the average.\n\nNet sales for 2017 decreased $350.1 million, or 16.9%, to $1.7 billion from $2.1 billion in 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of closed stores (net of new store openings) and an 8.4% decrease in comparable store sales. This decline was partially offset by sales of $23.4 million in the 53rd week. Comparable store sales were down 8.1% and 9.1% in Hometown and Outlet, respectively. The home appliances and lawn & garden categories both outperformed the average comparable store sales while tools underperformed to the average.\nNet loss\nRIM inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation, as well as gross margin. The methodologies utilized by SHO in its application of RIM are consistent for all periods presented. Such methodologies include the development of the cost-to-retail ratios, the groupings of homogeneous classes of merchandise, the development of shrinkage and obsolescence reserves, and the accounting for retail price changes. We believe that SHO's RIM provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost. Among others, two significant estimates used in inventory valuation are the level and timing of permanent markdowns (clearance markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow-moving inventory) and shrinkage. Amounts are charged to cost of sales at the time the retail value of inventory is reduced through the use of permanent markdowns.\nSecurity and Guarantees\n\nCash used in operating activities in 2017 was $105.6 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $28.9 million in 2016. Our 2017 cash use was driven by a $52.6 million reduction in payables to Sears Holdings and $34.4 million in IT transformation costs. In 2016 $28.9 million of cash was generated primarily due to a reduction in net inventory investment (inventory less payable). Total merchandise inventories were $336.3 million at February 3, 2018 and $373.8 million at January 29, 2017. Merchandise inventories declined $13.9 million and $23.6 million in Hometown and Outlet, respectively, primarily due to store closures.\nGross Margin\n53 Week Period Ended February 3, 2018 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 -- Hometown\nWe recorded operating losses of $42.3 million and $12.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $30.0 million increase in operating loss was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of assets in 2016 and lower volume, partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses, higher gross margin rates, and a $1.5 million favorable impact from the 53rd week.\nThe Term Loan Agreement includes a number of negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company, the Borrowers, and the Company's other subsidiaries to, subject to exceptions, incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees), grant liens, make investments, make dividends or other distributions with respect to, or repurchase, the Company's capital stock, make prepayments on other indebtedness, engage in mergers, or change the nature of the business. In addition, upon excess availability falling below a specified level or the occurrence of an event of default the Company would be subject to a cash dominion requirement. The Term Loan Agreement also provides that the Borrowers will not permit availability under the Term Loan Agreement and the Senior ABL Facility to be less than 10% of a combined loan cap.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nNet Sales\nGross margin was $246.1 million, or 20.9% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $293.9 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2016. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by lower closing store costs and lower occupancy costs partially offset by lower margin on merchandise sales. The total impact of store closing and occupancy costs decreased gross margin rate 172 basis points for the full year 2017 compared to 260 basis points for the full year 2016.\nOur dealers and franchisees exercise control over the operations of their stores, including complete responsibility for supervising their store management and their store employees and making capital decisions. Several of the primary differences between Company-operated stores and dealer or franchisee-operated stores are that (1) the Company is responsible for occupancy and\npayroll costs associated with Company-operated stores while our dealers and franchisees are responsible for these costs for their stores, (2) the Company is responsible for all terms and conditions of employment for the employees in the Company-operated stores and our dealers and franchisees are responsible for all terms and conditions of employment for the employees in their stores, and (3) we pay commissions to our dealers and franchisees.\nThe Term Loan is subject to mandatory prepayment in amounts equal to the amount by which the outstanding Term Loan exceeds the borrowing base specified in the Term Loan Agreement plus a reserve to be maintained against the borrowing base for the Senior ABL Facility (the push-down reserve\u201d), which reserve will be equal to total outstandings under the Term Loan Agreement that exceed the Term Loan Agreement's borrowing base, if such excess were to arise. The Company may not reborrow amounts prepaid.\nWe recorded a net loss of $131.9 million for 2016 compared to a net loss of $27.3 million for 2015. The increase in our net loss was primarily attributable to a higher operating loss, including store-closing costs, and an increase in income tax expense.\nPrepayments\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $318.6 million, or 22.1% of net sales, in 2016 from $378.1 million, or 23.2% of net sales, in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of (1) lower expenses being recorded for stores closed (net of new store openings), (2) lower dealer and franchisee commissions on lower sales volume, (3) converting some dealer and franchisee locations to Company-operated stores in 2016, which resulted in some costs previously recorded as selling and administrative expenses to be recorded as a reduction to gross margin, and (4) a $12.7 million charge in 2015 related to expenses for uncollectible franchise notes receivable. The Company recorded $0.9 million of selling and administrative expenses related to store closings for 2016. IT Transformation costs were $9.9 million for 2016 compared to $7.4 million for 2015. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT Transformation costs and charges related to franchise notes receivable increased selling and administrative expenses 64 basis points and 123 basis points for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nUses and Sources of Liquidity\nSenior ABL Facility\nPrepayments\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $348.5 million, or 20.3% of net sales, for 2017 compared to $408.7 million, or 19.7% of net sales, for 2016. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by higher margin on merchandise sales and lower shrink partially offset by higher occupancy costs as a percentage of sales resulting from a greater mix of Company-operated stores compared to the prior year. Accelerated store closing costs were $14.2 million for 2017 compared to $15.7 million for 2016. The total impact of occupancy costs, accelerated closing store costs, and shrink reduced gross margin rate 496 basis points for 2017 compared to a 490 basis-point reduction for 2016.\nThe Senior ABL Facility is secured by a first lien security interest on substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles, investment property, equipment, cash, cash equivalents, deposit accounts and securities accounts, as well as certain other assets (other than intellectual property and fee-owned interests in real property) ancillary to any of the foregoing and all proceeds of any of the foregoing, including cash proceeds and the proceeds of applicable insurance. The Senior ABL Facility is guaranteed by the Company and each of its existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (other than specified immaterial subsidiaries).\nThe foregoing factors should not be understood as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements, including the \"Risk Factors,\" that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our other public announcements. While we believe that our forecasts and assumptions are reasonable, we caution that actual results may differ materially. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what we projected. Consequently, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are made only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf, whether as a result of new information, future developments, subsequent events or circumstances, or otherwise, except as required by law.\nHistorically, all of the Company's Outlet stores were operated by the Company. We initiated efforts to franchise Outlet stores in 2012, with the first stores transferred to franchisees during the 2013 fiscal year. During the second quarter of 2015 the Company suspended its franchising of additional stores except to existing Company franchisees, and the suspension is continuing. As of February 3, 2018, 11 of the 132 Sears Outlet stores were operated by franchisees.\nThe Term Loan Agreement also contains affirmative covenants including, among others, financial and other reporting and notification requirements, maintenance of properties, inspection rights, and physical inventories. The Company and the Borrowers also agree that the Company and the Borrowers will cause the push-down reserve to be established and maintained when and if required by the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement borrowing base generally means specified amounts of credit card receivables and inventory (net of reserves), minus the loan cap for the Senior ABL Facility and availability reserves.\nGross margin was $293.9 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2016 compared to $368.1 million, or 22.6% of net sales, in 2015. The decrease in gross margin rate was primarily driven by (1) $15.1 million of store-closing costs, (2) lower margin on merchandise sales, (3) higher occupancy costs due to an increase in the number of Company-operated stores, and (4) higher shrink due to $4.6 million of physical inventory gains in 2015. The total impact of occupancy, store-closing costs, and shrink reduced gross margin rate 285 basis points for 2016 compared to a reduction of 124 basis points for 2015.\nInterest; Fees\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMerchandise Subsidies and Cash Discounts from Sears Holdings\nFinancing Arrangements\nNet Sales\nThe Senior ABL Facility includes a number of negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the guarantors) to, subject to certain exceptions, incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees), grant liens, make investments, make prepayments on other indebtedness, and engage in mergers or change the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the guarantors). In addition, upon excess availability falling below a specified level the Company would be subject to a cash dominion requirement and more frequent borrowing base reporting requirements. The Senior ABL Facility also limits SHO's ability to declare and pay cash dividends and to repurchase its common stock. The Senior ABL Facility would not have permitted us to pay cash dividends or to repurchase our common stock as of February 3, 2018. The Senior ABL Facility also contains affirmative covenants, including financial and other reporting requirements.\nIn the normal course of business, stores can transition from Company-operated to franchisee or dealer-operated, and vice-versa. Potential new store locations may be identified by the Company, an existing dealer or franchisee, or a potential dealer or franchisee. If the Company identifies and develops a location, it will generally seek to transfer that store to a dealer. When the Company takes back a store from a franchisee, the Company's gross margin will generally decrease as the our cost of occupancy, which is reflected in cost of sales and occupancy will increase. In addition, the Company's selling and administrative expense will decrease as the Company's commission payments, which are reflected in selling and administrative expense, will decrease. The decrease in commission payments will be partially offset by higher payroll and benefits expense.\nThe Term Loan Agreement is secured by a second lien security interest (subordinate only to the liens securing the Senior ABL Facility) on substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (the same assets as the assets specified with respect to the Senior ABL Facility), including without limitation accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles, investment property, equipment, cash, cash equivalents, deposit accounts and securities accounts, as well as other assets (other than intellectual property and fee-owned interests in real property) ancillary to any of the foregoing and all proceeds of any of the foregoing, including cash proceeds and the proceeds of applicable insurance. The Term Loan Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and each of its existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (other than specified immaterial subsidiaries).\nWe obtain our merchandise through agreements with subsidiaries of Sears Holdings and with other vendors. Merchandise acquired from subsidiaries of Sears Holdings (including Kenmore, Craftsman, DieHard, and other merchandise) accounted for approximately 78% and 80% of total purchases of all inventory from all vendors for 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect the percentage of total purchases of inventory acquired from subsidiaries of Sears Holdings to decrease in the future as we increase our direct purchases from other merchandise vendors. Fourth quarter 2017 purchases from Sears Holdings accounted for 74% of total purchases compared to 84% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 76% in the third quarter of 2017. The loss of, or a material reduction in, the amount of merchandise made available to us by Sears Holdings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nNet Sales\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of an owned property located in San Leandro, California. Net proceeds from the sale were $26.1 million, and we recorded a gain on the sale of $25.3 million.\nNet loss\nGross margin was $102.4 million, or 18.9% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $114.9 million, or 18.2% of net sales, in 2016. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by a higher gross profit rate on merchandise sales primarily driven by new pricing strategies and renegotiated merchandise costs and lower shrink expenses. These increases were partially offset by flat occupancy costs, but higher on a rate-to-sales basis, and higher store closings costs ($7.6 million for 2017 compared to $1.0 million for 2016). The total impact of store closing costs, occupancy costs and shrink was a reduction to gross margin rate of 1,131 basis points for 2017 compared to 957 basis points for 2016.\nOperating Loss\nWe had $10.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of February 3, 2018 and $14.1 million as of January 28, 2017.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in \"Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking and Other Information.\"\nSecurity and Guarantees\n52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 30, 2016\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING AND OTHER INFORMATION\n53 Week Period Ended February 3, 2018 Compared to the 52 Week Period Ended January 28, 2017 -- Outlet\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing the financial statements, certain accounting policies require considerable judgment to select the appropriate assumptions to calculate financial estimates. These estimates are complex and subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our estimates on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, evaluation of trends and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Although the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the financial statements, we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\nWe believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and the considerations used in estimating amounts, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n \u2022 713 Hometown Stores-Primarily independently operated stores, predominantly located in smaller communities, and offering home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, sporting goods, and household goods. All of our Hometown Stores carry proprietary Sears-branded products, such as Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard, as well as a wide assortment of other national brands. \nOutlet\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to $140.2 million, or 22.2% of net sales, for 2016 compared to $168.0 million, or 25.5% of net sales, for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower franchisee commissions on lower sales volumes, converting some franchisee locations to Company-operated stores in 2016 (which resulted in some costs previously recorded as selling and administrative expenses being recorded as a reduction to gross margin), and $12.7 million of provisions for franchisee note receivables in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by higher payroll and benefits costs resulting from a higher number of Company-operated stores. The Company recorded $0.1 million of store-closing selling and administrative expenses for 2016. IT Transformation costs were $5.1 million for 2016 compared to $3.5 million for 2015. On a rate-to-sales basis, IT Transformation costs and charges related to franchise notes receivable increased selling and administrative expense 80 basis points and 247 basis points for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the forward looking statements\u201d).

Under the Prior Facility the Company initially borrowed $100 million which was used to pay a cash dividend to Sears Holdings prior to the Separation. On November 1, 2016 the Company's three operating subsidiaries, Sears Authorized Hometown Stores, LLC, Sears Home Appliance Showrooms, LLC, and Sears Outlet Stores, L.L.C., and the Company, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (which amended and restated the Prior Facility) with a syndicate of lenders, including Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, which provides (subject to availability under a borrowing base) for aggregate maximum borrowings of $250 million (the \"Senior ABL Facility\"). The Senior ABL Facility provides for extended revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount equal to $170 million (the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments\u201d) and non-extended revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount equal to $80 million (the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments\u201d). The Extended Revolving Credit Commitments will mature on the earlier of (1) February 29, 2020 and (2) six months prior to the expiration of agreements entered into with Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries\nSince 2015 the Company has excluded initial franchise revenues from adjusted EBITDA.

analysis report:\n\nOverview\n- Sears Hometown is a national retailer focused on home appliances, lawn/garden equipment, tools, and hardware. As of February 2018, it had 900 stores across the U.S. In 2017, it opened 7 stores and closed 127 stores.\n\n2017 Financial Results\n- Net sales decreased 16.9% to $1.7 billion, driven by closed stores and an 8.4% drop in comparable store sales. There was a 53rd week which added $23.4 million in sales.\n- Operating loss increased to $87.4 million from $47.7 million in 2016, due to lower sales volume and the 2016 gain on sale of assets of $25.2 million.\n- Net loss narrowed to $95.1 million from $131.9 million in 2016, helped by lower income tax expense.\n\nLiquidity/Cash Flows\n- Ended 2017 with $10.4 million in cash, funded operations through financing activities in 2017. Used cash in operations, driven by IT investments and lower payables.\n- Has a $250 million Senior ABL Facility, borrowed $137.9 million as of February 2018. Also entered a $40 million Term Loan in February 2018 to pay down ABL facility.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n- Inventory valuation using retail inventory method requires estimates for markdowns and shrinkage. \n- Impairment testing of long-lived assets involves estimates of future cash flows.\n- Income taxes require estimates of future taxable income to assess deferred tax assets.\n\nThose are some of the key items from the management's discussion and analysis. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."}
