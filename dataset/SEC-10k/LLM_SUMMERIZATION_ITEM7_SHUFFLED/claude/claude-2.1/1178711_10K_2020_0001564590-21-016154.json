Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to other risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements included in this section are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement, except as required by law.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel life-saving therapies for life-threatening diseases or other public health threats for civilian, government and military use. Our United States, or U.S., Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved commercial product, NUZYRA\u00ae (omadacycline) is a once-daily oral and intravenous antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP, and acute skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI, caused by susceptible pathogens. SEYSARA\u00ae (sarecycline) is an FDA-approved product with respect to which we have exclusively licensed in the U.S. and the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Macau, or the greater China region, certain rights to Almirall, LLC, or Almirall. SEYSARA is currently being marketed by Almirall in the U.S. as a once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. With respect to our technology as it relates to sarecycline, we retain development and commercialization rights in all countries other than the U.S. and the greater China region, and in February 2020, we exclusively licensed from Almirall certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates that is necessary or useful to develop or commercialize sarecycline outside of the U.S. Almirall plans to develop sarecycline for acne in China, with a submission to the China National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, expected in 2023.\nIn December 2019, we entered into a five-year contract with an option to extend to ten years with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, herein referred to as the BARDA contract. The BARDA contract supports the development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, FDA post-marketing requirements, or PMRs, associated with the initial NUZYRA approval, and an option for BARDA to procure up to 10,000 treatment courses of NUZYRA for the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, for use against potential biothreats. Under the terms of the BARDA contract, we have been awarded initial funding of approximately $59.4 million for the development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax and the purchase of an initial 2,500 treatment courses of NUZYRA to add to the current SNS. BARDA has also exercised two options that awarded additional funding including approximately $76.8 million for existing FDA PMRs that began in April 2020 and approximately $20.4 million for manufacturing-related requirements that also began in April 2020. Remaining option funding includes the potential for approximately $12.7 million to support the development of NUZYRA for the prophylaxis of anthrax and a maximum of approximately $115.3 million to provide for three additional purchases of NUZYRA for the SNS, each of which will be triggered at BARDA's discretion upon us demonstrating continued progress in the anthrax development program.\nWe have made significant progress in the pulmonary anthrax development program under the BARDA contract. A pharmacokinetic, or PK, study in rabbits was recently completed, which will lead into the pilot efficacy studies in this species. In addition, we have evaluated minimum inhibitory concentrations, or MICs, of omadacycline against approximately 100 anthrax strains. Omadacycline continued to demonstrate potent MICs and is considered effective against all bacteria tested. The collection of isolates had a strain resistant to doxycycline and a strain resistant to ciprofloxacin, the two antibiotics currently in the SNS after approval for the treatment of anthrax many years ago. Omadacycline activity was not impacted in either of those resistant strains.\nTogether with BARDA, we continue to make progress advancing our efforts to onshore the manufacturing of NUZYRA to the U.S. We have completed the knowledge transfer of our manufacturing process for the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of omadacycline to our U.S. onshoring partners and are currently in the development stage of the initiative. The process flow, equipment selection and facility modifications have been planned and process development and engineering are expected to be completed in 2021. The manufacturing process validation will begin in early 2022, with the goal of commercial supply production in the U.S. by 2023.\nOn February 24, 2021, we announced that the initial NUZYRA procurement for the SNS under our contract with BARDA was expected to occur in the first half of 2021 and another procurement in the second half of 2021. The initial procurement is contingent upon receipt of comments from the FDA on the pre-emergency use authorization, or pre-EUA, submitted in February 2020. As part of the ongoing review, supplemental mouse pharmacokinetic data requested by the FDA was submitted in November 2020. On March 2, 2021, we received feedback from the FDA with a recommendation to consider an additional in vitro model to further characterize the optimal pharmacokinetic parameters for pulmonary anthrax as part of the development program. We are in discussions with BARDA to align on the best approach to integrating the FDA recommendation into the development program. BARDA is working with FDA to satisfy BARDA's requirement that the status of the current pre-EUA will enable them to initiate the first procurement into the SNS. Once the initial procurement is completed, the timing of future procurements is not expected to be impacted.\nWe also continue to pursue a number of other opportunities for NUZYRA. The first of these is the filing with the FDA of a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, for the oral-only loading dose regimen for patients diagnosed with CABP. The sNDA includes the results of a study designed with agreement from the FDA to show that an oral-only loading dose regimen will have a comparable pharmacokinetic profile to the approved IV loading dose regimen in patients with CABP that was established in the Phase 3 registration study. Enrollment in this study was stopped early in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions at the clinical centers. Data obtained from the study was reviewed and determined to support the submission of the sNDA in July 2020. We believe consideration for this oral-only loading dose regimen is expected during the second quarter of 2021.\nWe have initiated discussions with the FDA to explore potential regulatory registration paths to determine the efficacy and safety of omadacycline in patients afflicted with non-tuberculous mycobacteria abscessus, or NTM, which are environmental organisms that can be found in soil, dust, and water, including natural and municipal water sources. Infection occurs when a person is exposed to NTM organisms. NTM can form difficult-to-eliminate biofilms, which are collections of microorganisms that stick to each other, and adhere to surfaces in moist environments. Although severe infection can affect the lymph nodes, skin, soft tissues, bones, and joints, the vast majority of NTM infection cases are pulmonary. The diagnosis of NTM infection is often delayed due to non-specific symptoms and a lack of disease state awareness by clinicians. NTM is a rare and orphan disease with no FDA-approved therapies, which we estimate has a potential $1.0 billion addressable market in the U.S.\nStart-up activities for a Phase 2b clinical study for treatment of NTM with omadacycline are underway, with the initiation of patient enrollment planned for as early as the first half of 2021. This study is a placebo-controlled, randomized monotherapy study of NTM in patients who are not receiving other treatments. Study size will be approximately 75 subjects randomized in a 1.5 to 1 ratio. Therapy will last for 12 weeks with an efficacy endpoint assessment at that timepoint. Due to the small numbers of patients with this rare disease, we expect this study will complete enrollment within approximately two years from commencement.\nOur data generation and medical affairs activities have progressed with the initiation of ten non-clinical and clinical studies in investigator-initiated research, or IIR, programs, and the publication of 19 omadacycline manuscripts that address the use of NUZYRA in special pathogens, populations or disease states that will further define its unique therapeutic profile. In parallel, real-world evidence from two ongoing observational studies and independent case series continue to be published in peer reviewed journals that describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients with challenging infections, particularly in NTM and osteomyelitis, that receive omadacycline as a therapeutic agent.\nData generation will continue to expand throughout 2021 with additional evidence from our IIR programs in areas such as diabetic foot and C. difficile infections. In addition, non-clinical research studying the activity of omadacycline alone and in combination in an osteomyelitis model in rats and studies in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium avium complex, or MAC, will build on the growing library of scientific data for NUZYRA.\nTo date, we have devoted a substantial amount of our resources to research and development efforts, including conducting clinical trials for omadacycline, protecting our intellectual property and providing selling, general and administrative support for these operations. We have historically financed our operations primarily through sales of our common stock, debt financings, strategic collaborations, and grant funding. We began generating revenue from product sales in February 2019.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception in 1996. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2020 was $807.8 million and our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $96.5 million. A substantial amount of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. The net losses and negative operating cash flows incurred to date, together with expected future losses, have had, and likely will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders' deficit and working capital. The amount of future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate offsetting revenue. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years.\nWhile our BARDA contract is expected to significantly strengthen our cash position, unless we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our commercial products, we may need to raise additional capital in order to support and accelerate the commercialization of omadacycline and to advance the development of our other indications for omadacycline, such as NTM, or other product candidates. If we cannot generate a sufficient amount of product or royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt or other structured financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. We may be unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, which would force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our development programs or commercialization efforts. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never be able to do so.\nBusiness Update Regarding COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is continuing to affect our employees, health care institutions, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The COVID-19 related restrictions on in-person promotional access to health care institutions and the overall impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the health care and hospital environments could restrict the full potential of NUZYRA's growth. The length of time and full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.\nTo date, we and our partners have been able to continue to supply our products to our patients worldwide and currently do not anticipate any interruptions in supply for the foreseeable future. Regarding our clinical programs, enrollment in our study designed to show that an oral-only loading dose regimen will have a comparable pharmacokinetic profile to the approved IV loading dose regimen in patients with CABP that was established in the Phase 3 registration study was stopped early in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions at the clinical centers. We continue to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, including our sales, expenses, supply chain and other clinical studies.\nOur office-based employees have been working from home since early March 2020. We suspended in-person interactions by our customer-facing personnel in healthcare settings during the majority of the second quarter of 2020. During this period of suspended in-person interactions, we engaged with our customers remotely in an effort to continue to support and educate healthcare professionals. In late June 2020, our customer-facing personnel began re-engaging with our customers in a manner consistent with guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other state and local mandates. Our customer-facing personnel are now operating through a hybrid model of both virtual and in-person engagement.\nOur third-party contract manufacturing partners continue to operate their manufacturing facilities at or near normal levels. While we currently do not anticipate any interruptions in our supply chain, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our and/or our third-party suppliers' and contract manufacturing partners' ability to manufacture our products or the products of our partners. The COVID-19 pandemic has prevented technical service, quality assurance and supply operations personnel from traveling to our third-party contract manufacturing partners in Europe.\nFor additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this report.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nProduct Revenue, Net\nProduct revenue, net, is recognized when earned on sales of NUZYRA, which was approved by the FDA in October 2018 and launched in the U.S. in February 2019. NUZYRA is sold principally to a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers in the U.S. These customers subsequently resell our product to health care providers or dispense the product to patients. In addition to distribution agreements with customers, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of our product. Product revenue is recognized net of reserves for all variable consideration, including rebates, chargebacks, discounts and product returns.\nGovernment Contract Service Revenue\nGovernment contract service revenue is recognized when earned under our BARDA contract and represents the reimbursement by BARDA of costs incurred by us for work performed to develop NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax plus a small fixed administrative fee. Refer to Note 5, Government Contract Revenue in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the BARDA contract and related revenue recognition.\nGovernment Contract Grant Revenue\nThe allocated consideration of government contract grant revenue is recognized when earned under our BARDA contract and represents the reimbursement by BARDA of costs incurred by us for FDA post-marketing requirements, or PMRs, associated with the approval of NUZYRA, including CABP and pediatric studies, as well as a five-year post-marketing bacterial surveillance study. Refer to Note 5, Government Contract Revenue in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the BARDA contract and related revenue recognition.\nCollaboration and Royalty Revenue\nCollaboration and royalty revenue are recognized when revenue earned under our collaboration and license agreements. Refer to Note 6, License and Collaboration Agreements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the collaboration agreements and the related revenue recognition.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue represents the cost of the product itself, labor and overhead, and any reserve for excess or obsolete inventory, as well as stability studies, inventory scrap and royalty expense. Cost of product revenue also represents royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses consisted primarily of costs directly incurred by us for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 362: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses incurred under agreements with clinical research organizations, or CROs, and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 363: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical study materials and developing manufacturing processes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 364: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> direct employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense of our research and development personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 365: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> allocated facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 366: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory compliance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses also include gross reimbursable costs incurred related to research and development services performed for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, services performed for U.S. manufacturing onshoring and security requirements, and services performed for FDA PMRs under the BARDA contract.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our products or product candidates for which we or any partner obtain regulatory approval, such as NUZYRA and SEYSARA. Aside from the FDA approval of NUZYRA and SEYSARA in the U.S., we or our partners may never succeed in achieving other regulatory approvals for NUZYRA, or any of our other product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates depend on a variety of factors, including:\nTable 367: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 368: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> future clinical trial results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 369: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> potential changes in government regulation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 370: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that therapeutic candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority, were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of the clinical development of product candidates, or if we experience significant delays in the enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nWe manage certain activities, such as clinical trial operations, manufacture of clinical trial material, and preclinical animal toxicology studies, through third-party contract organizations. The only costs we track by each product candidate are external costs such as services provided to us by CROs, manufacturing of preclinical and clinical drug product, and other outsourced research and development expenses. We do not assign or allocate to individual development programs internal costs such as salaries and benefits, facilities costs, lab supplies and the costs of preclinical research and studies. Our research and development expenses for omadacycline and other projects during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nTable 371: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Omadacycline\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other research and development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of compensation costs associated with our contract sales force, commercial support personnel, and medical affairs professionals, as well as personnel in executive and other administrative functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, trade, and other commercial costs and distribution fees necessary to support the launch of NUZYRA and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services.\nInterest Income\nInterest income represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense represents interest incurred on the Notes (as defined below), the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement, and the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement (as defined below) as well as the adjustment of our marketable securities to amortized cost.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement, which included any unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, recognized upon termination.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nTable 372: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product revenue, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government contract service revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government contract grant revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration and royalty revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,504\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (115,629\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,240\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,368\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (31\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss before provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96,541\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (128,489\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (96,541\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (128,790\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Revenue, Net\nNet product revenue recognized on sales of NUZYRA in the U.S. was $38.8 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in net product revenue is primarily the result of an increase in sales volume due to higher customer demand.\nGovernment Contract Service Revenue\nGovernment contract service revenue earned under our BARDA contract was $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. No such government contract service revenue was earned during the year ended December 31, 2019 as the BARDA contract was executed in December 2019.\nGovernment Contract Grant Revenue\nGovernment contract grant revenue earned under our BARDA contract was $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. No such government contract grant revenue was earned during the year ended December 31, 2019 as the BARDA contract was executed in December 2019.\nCollaboration and Royalty Revenue\nCollaboration and royalty revenue were $1.5 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nCollaboration and royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of $1.3 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. by Almirall under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), and $0.2 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of XERAVA in the U.S. by Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. under the Tetraphase License Agreement (as defined below). Fourth quarter royalty revenue recognized for sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. was estimated using third-party data and an approximation of discounts and allowances to calculate net product sales, to which the Company then applied the applicable royalty percentage specified in the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted in the period in which they become known, which is expected to be the following quarter.\nCollaboration and royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was comprised of a $3.0 million milestone payment earned under the Zai Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), upon submission of the first regulatory approval application for a licensed product in the People's Republic of China in December 2019, $1.9 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. by Almirall under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), and $0.1 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of XERAVA in the U.S. by Tetraphase under the Tetraphase License Agreement. Fourth quarter royalty revenue recognized for sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. was estimated using third party data and an approximation of discounts and allowances to calculate net product sales, to which we then applied the applicable royalty percentage specified in the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is expected to be the following quarter.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $5.2 million increase is primarily the result of an increase in NUZYRA product sales, NUZYRA sample program shipments, royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA, and certain period costs. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, certain of the costs of NUZYRA units recognized as revenue during years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were expensed prior to FDA approval in October 2018, and therefore are not included in cost of product revenue during the periods. We expect cost of product revenue to increase in absolute dollars as product revenue increases.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses were $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $15.7 million decrease is primarily the result of lower personnel-related costs and lower clinical study costs associated with completion of our Phase 2 UTI program in 2019, partially offset by an increase in costs incurred under the BARDA contract and third-party manufacturing scale-up costs.\nWe anticipate an increase in research and development expenses in future periods as we continue development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, continue the work on our FDA PMRs, and continue the onshoring of our manufacturing process, the majority of which is reimbursable under the BARDA contract. We will also incur additional spend as we continue exploring pathways for NTM indications.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $89.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $0.8 million increase is primarily the result of an increase in costs to outsource our contract sales organization, higher product distribution fees, and additional investigator-initiated research grants offset by lower marketing, market research and promotional program costs, personnel-related costs, and travel, entertainment, and other operating expenses.\nWe anticipate an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in support of our expansion into the community setting and other commercial activities, as well as the continued costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include costs related to the NUZYRA community expansion, travel, in-person\ntraining events and sales meetings, the hiring of additional personnel, executing marketing and promotional programs, and engaging consultants, legal and other professional fees, and other operating expenses.\nOther Income and Expenses\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents interest incurred on the Notes of $8.8 million, the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement of $7.3 million, the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement of $4.0 million and interest expense related to our money market funds and marketable securities of $0.1 million. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities of $1.5 million.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 represents interest incurred on the Notes of $8.7 million, the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement of $6.8 million, and the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement of $2.7 million, partially offset by the net accretion of our marketable securities of $1.8 million. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities of $3.6 million.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nOn December 31, 2020, we used the proceeds from the sale of the Royalty Interest and Revenue Interest from the R-Bridge Loan Agreement (as defined below), together with cash on hand, to prepay in full all obligations outstanding under the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement. Repayment of all amounts outstanding under the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement qualified as an extinguishment of debt on the date the payment was made in satisfaction of all amounts due and we were unconditionally relieved of our obligations therein. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million was calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt, which includes any unamortized debt discount and issuance costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn July 2019, we entered into an At the Market Sales Agreement, or the 2019 Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, and BTIG, LLC, or BTIG, under which we were permitted to offer and sell our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $50.0 million from time to time through Jefferies and BTIG as our sales agents. Sales of our common stock through Jefferies and BTIG were to be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including without limitation sales made directly on the Nasdaq Global Market or any other existing trading market for its common stock. Jefferies and BTIG, as applicable, were entitled to a commission of 3% of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through Jefferies and BTIG under the 2019 Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 5,176,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2019 Sales Agreement for $21.9 million in proceeds, after deducting commissions of $0.7 million, which fully utilized the 2019 Sales Agreement. Upon completion of the final sale of our shares of common stock available for sale under the 2019 Sales Agreement, that agreement was terminated.\nOn February 25, 2019, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Paratek Royalty Corporation, entered into the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth therein, we borrowed a $32.5 million loan, which was secured by, and will be repaid based upon, royalties from the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. On May 1, 2019, we received $27.8 million, net of $0.5 million lender discount, $0.2 million in lender expenses incurred, and $4.0 million that was deposited into an interest reserve account. We also paid $1.2 million in other lender fees related to the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nOn May 11, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, as amended on June 19, 2020 and declared effective on July 9, 2020, to sell certain of our securities in an aggregate amount of up to $250.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, $250.0 million remains available on this shelf registration statement.\nWe have used and we intend to continue to use the net proceeds from the above offerings of our common stock and the Notes, as well as other current and retired long-term debt agreements, together with our existing capital resources and future NUZYRA product sales, government contract revenue and royalty revenue, to fund our\nongoing company operations, including clinical studies of omadacycline, NUZYRA commercial operations, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 16, Long-Term Debt, for further details on our loan agreements, which include the Notes, the R-Bridge Loan Agreement and the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $125.2 million.\nThe following table summarizes our cash provided by and (used in) operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\nTable 373: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (103,424\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (134,045\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 134,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities was $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $134.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net cash used in operating activities primarily consists of our net losses adjusted for non-cash items and changes in components of operating assets and liabilities as follows:\nTable 374: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> For the year ended December 31, 2020, a net loss of $96.5 million was adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense of $10.2 million, non-cash interest expense of $1.5 million, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 million, and a net decrease of $20.3 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities.

Our future funding requirements will depend on our ability to generate continued revenue from sales of NUZYRA, and our partner, Almirall's, ability to generate continued revenue from sales of SEYSARA, with respect to which we are entitled to tiered royalties in the U.S. and flat royalties in the greater China region. We do not expect to generate any other revenue unless and until our omadacycline greater China region partner, Zai, and our SEYSARA greater China region partner, Almirall, obtains regulatory approval of and commercializes its respective product in the greater China region. Zai submitted the first regulatory approval application for a licensed product in the People's Republic of China in December 2019, which was accepted by the China NMPA in February 2020 and, in April 2020, the NMPA granted priority review status for its application. We will require substantial additional funding to meet FDA PMRs for NUZYRA, which we expect to continue to be funded through the BARDA contract. Additional resources will also be needed to support and accelerate the commercialization of NUZYRA, fund the development of omadacycline in other indications, including NTM and pulmonary anthrax, and to advance the development of potential other product candidates, and such funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all. BARDA's procurement of NUZYRA for the SNS will also be an important component to satisfying future funding requirements. While it is difficult to predict with certainty, on February 24, 2021, we announced that the initial NUZYRA procurement for the SNS under our contract with BARDA was expected to occur in the first half of 2021 and another procurement in the second half of 2021. The initial procurement is contingent upon receipt of comments from the FDA on the pre-emergency use authorization, or pre-EUA, submitted in February 2020. As part of the ongoing review, supplemental mouse pharmacokinetic data requested by the FDA was submitted in November 2020. On March 2, 2021, we received feedback from the FDA with a recommendation to consider an additional in vitro model to further characterize the optimal pharmacokinetic parameters for pulmonary anthrax as part of the development program. We are in discussions with BARDA to align on the best approach to integrating the FDA recommendation into the development program. BARDA is working with FDA to satisfy BARDA's requirement that the status of the current pre-EUA will enable them to initiate the first procurement into the SNS. Once the initial procurement is completed, the timing of future procurements is not expected to be impacted.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenditures and operating losses for the next several years as we:\nTable 384: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct additional clinical trials of omadacycline;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 385: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek regulatory approvals for additional indications for omadacycline, such as omadacycline for the treatment of NTM and pulmonary anthrax;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 386: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue to augment our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize NUZYRA and increase our manufacturing capacity and capabilities to satisfy demand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 387: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> add personnel to support the business as we expand our commercial footprint and commercial footprint;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 388: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> build product inventory; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 389: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> service and pay down our debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased upon our current operating plan, we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $125.2 million as of December 31, 2020, will extend our cash runway through the end of 2023 with a pathway to cash flow break even.\nWe have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our pharmaceutical products, especially given the constraints on in-person promotion of NUZYRA and reduced access to prescribers due to restrictions in access to hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the unknown extent to which we will maintain existing or enter into new collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our product and product candidates, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures that we will require to fund our continuing operations, including for our clinical development programs and commercialization efforts for NUZYRA. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 390: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress of clinical development of omadacycline in additional indications, including NTM and pulmonary anthrax;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 391: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of commercialization activities for NUZYRA;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 392: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> product revenue received from commercial sales of NUZYRA;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 393: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> royalty revenue received from commercial sales of SEYSARA by Almirall;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 394: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> timing and amount of actual reimbursements and NUZYRA purchases under the BARDA contract;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 395: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the ability of Zai to develop, manufacture and commercialize omadacycline in the Zai territory;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 396: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we may pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 397: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, preclinical development and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 398: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs, timing and outcome of seeking, obtaining, maintaining and expanding FDA and non-U.S. regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 399: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs associated with manufacturing and maintaining high quality sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 400: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we may pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 401: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 402: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our need and ability to hire additional management, scientific, commercial, operations and medical personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 403: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the effect of competing products that may limit market penetration of our products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 404: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 405: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> resources required to develop and implement policies and processes to promote ongoing compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 406: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs required to ensure that our and our partners' business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 407: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the economic and other terms, timing and success of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future, including the timing of receipt of any milestone or royalty payments under such arrangements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 408: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy generally and on our business and operations specifically, including our sales of NUZYRA, sales by our collaboration partners with respect to which we are entitled to royalties, our third-party manufacturers and supply chain, our research and development efforts, our clinical trials and our employees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product and royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through a combination of public or private equity\nofferings, debt or other structured financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. We do not have any committed external sources of funds other than the rights under the BARDA contract and the rights to contingent milestone payments and/or royalties under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, the Almirall China License, the Tetraphase License Agreement and the Zai Collaboration Agreement, which are terminable by Almirall, Tetraphase and Zai, respectively, upon prior written notice. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect stockholders' rights. Future debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Additionally, future equity or debt financing may be difficult to obtain on favorable terms, if at all, in light of increased volatility within the global financial markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, NUZYRA, sarecycline, future revenue streams, research programs, product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market NUZYRA, sarecycline or our other product candidates that we may otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to, among other items, accounts receivable and related reserves, inventory and related reserves, accrued sales allowances, net product revenue, government contract service revenue, government contract grant revenue, SEYSARA royalty revenue, leases, stock-based compensation arrangements, manufacturing and clinical accruals, useful lives for depreciation and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist stockholders and investors reading the consolidated financial statements in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nAccounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied as services are rendered.\nWe enter into collaboration agreements for research, development, manufacturing and commercial services that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which it licenses certain rights to its product candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. The amount of variable consideration is constrained until it is probable that the revenue is not at a significant risk of reversal in a future period. The contracts into which we enter generally do not include significant financing components.\nAs part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the transaction price under step (iii) above and (b) the timing of revenue recognition, including the appropriate measure of progress, in step (v) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties, should be included in the transaction price, as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, we generally allocate the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nLicenses of intellectual property\nIn assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise(s), whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promise(s), whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise(s), and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise(s). For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nCustomer options\nIf an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent or include a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised.\nMilestone payments\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of us or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nRoyalties\nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all the royalty has been allocated is satisfied (or partially satisfied).\nContract costs\nWe recognize as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the costs are expected to be recovered. As a practical expedient, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. To date, we have not incurred any incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer.\nThe Company sells its product principally to a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers in the U.S. These customers subsequently resell the Company's product to health care providers or dispense the product to patients. In addition to distribution agreements with customers, the Company enters into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of our product.\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company's product, which typically occurs once the Company has transferred physical possession of the good to the customer. The transaction price that the Company recognizes as revenue reflects the amount it expects to be entitled to in connection with the sale and transfer of control of product to its customers. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. At the time that the Company's customers take control of the product, which is when the Company's performance obligation under the sales contracts is complete, the Company records product revenues net of applicable reserves for various types of variable consideration based on the Company's estimates of channel mix. The types of variable consideration in our product revenue are as follows:\nTable 409: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Trade discounts and allowances\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 410: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Product returns\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 411: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Chargebacks and rebates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 412: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Government rebates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 413: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Commercial payer and other rebates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 414: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Voluntary patient assistance programs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn determining the amounts of certain allowances and accruals, the Company must make significant judgments and estimates. For example, in determining these amounts, the Company estimates prescription demand from the specialty pharmacies, hospital demand, buying patterns by hospitals, hospital systems and/or group purchasing organizations and the levels of inventory held by specialty distributors and customers. Making these determinations involves analyzing third-party industry data to determine whether trends in historical channel distribution patterns will predict future product sales. The Company receives data periodically from its specialty distributors and customers on inventory levels and historical channel sales mix, and the Company considers this data when determining the amount of the allowances and accruals for variable consideration.\nThe amount of variable consideration is estimated by using either of the following methods, depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled:\nTable 415: <table> <tr> <td> a)\n</td> <td> The expected value\u201d is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. Under ASC 606, an expected value may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the Company has many contracts with similar characteristics.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 416: <table> <tr> <td> b)\n</td> <td> The most likely amount\u201d is the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (i.e., the single most likely outcome of the contract). Under ASC 606, the most likely amount may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the contract has only two possible outcomes (i.e., either achieve or do not achieve a threshold specified in a contract).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe method selected is applied consistently throughout the contract when estimating the effect of an uncertainty on an amount of variable consideration. In addition, the Company considers all the information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company and shall identify a reasonable number of possible consideration amounts. The relevant factors used in this determination include, but are not limited to, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns.\nIn assessing whether a constraint is necessary, the Company considers both the likelihood and the magnitude of the revenue reversal. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company's estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the Company's estimates, the Company adjusts these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. The specific considerations the Company uses in estimating these amounts related to variable consideration associated with the Company's products are as follows:\nTrade Discounts and Allowances - The Company generally provides customers with discounts that are explicitly stated in the Company's contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, the Company receives sales order management, data and distribution services from certain customers. To the extent the services received are distinct from the Company's sale of products to the customer, these payments are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss of the Company.\nProduct Returns - Generally, the Company's customers have the right to return any unopened/unused product supply during the 18-month period beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending 12 months after the labeled expiration date. Since the Company currently does not have history of NUZYRA returns, the Company estimated returns based on industry data for comparable products in the market. As the Company distributes its product and establishes historical sales over a longer period of time, the Company will be able to place more reliance on historical purchasing, demand and return patterns of its customers when evaluating its reserves for product returns.\nAt the end of each reporting period for any of our products, the Company may decide to constrain revenue for product returns based on information from various sources, including channel inventory levels and dating and sell-through data, the expiration dates of product currently being shipped, price changes of competitive products and introductions of generic products.\nChargebacks - Although the Company primarily sells products to specialty distributors in the U.S., the Company also enters into agreements with hospitals and outpatient infusion centers, either directly or through group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their members, in connection with the purchase of product. Based on these agreements, some of the Company's customers have the right to receive a discounted price on product purchases. In the case of discounted pricing, the Company typically provides a credit to its specialty distributors customer (i.e., chargeback), representing the difference between the customer's acquisition list price and the discounted price.\nGovernment Rebates -The Company is subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. The Company estimates our Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payer mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related product revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability that is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. For Medicare, the Company also estimates the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom it will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. The Company's liability for these rebates consists of an estimate of claims for the current quarter and estimated future claims that will be made for product sales that have been recognized as revenue but remain in distribution channel inventory at period end.\nCommercial Payer and Other Rebates - The Company plans to continue to contract with certain private payer organizations, primarily insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of NUZYRA and contracted formulary status. The Company estimates these rebates and records reserves for such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized. Currently, the reserve for customer payer rebates considers future utilization based on third-party studies of payer prescription data; the utilization is applied to product that remains in the distribution and retail pharmacy channel inventories at the end of each reporting period. As the Company distributes its product and establishes historical sales over a longer period of time (i.e., two years), the Company will be able to place more reliance on historical data related to commercial payer rebates (i.e., actual utilization units) while continuing to rely on third-party data related to payer prescriptions and utilization.\nPatient Assistance - The Company offers certain voluntary patient assistance programs for prescriptions, such as co-pay assistance programs, which are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payers. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that the Company expects to receive associated with product sale that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution and pharmacy channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company adjusts its allowances for cash discounts, product returns, chargebacks, and other rebates and discounts when the Company believes actual experience may differ from current estimates.\nRevenue Earned Under Government Contracts\nIf the Company concludes that some or all aspects of its government contracts represent a transaction with a customer to obtain services or goods that are an output of its ordinary activities in exchange for consideration, it accounts for those aspects of the arrangement in accordance with ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. Arrangements that are entirely in the scope of other guidance are accounted for under that guidance.\nThe Company recognizes sales of NUZYRA under its government contracts as product revenue when control of NUZYRA is transferred, in accordance with ASC 606. It also recognizes government contract service revenue and government contract grant revenue as defined below.\nGovernment Contract Service Revenue\nGovernment contract service revenue is recognized as services are performed. Revenue and related reimbursable expenses are presented on a gross basis in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The related reimbursable expenses are expensed as incurred as research and development expense.\nGovernment Contract Grant Revenue\nThe allocated consideration of government contract grant revenue is recognized as the related reimbursable expenses are incurred. The cost reimbursements that are reported as revenue is presented gross of the related reimbursable expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The related reimbursable expenses are expensed as incurred as research and development expense.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue consists primarily of the manufacturing costs for NUZYRA and royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA. All manufacturing costs incurred prior to NUZYRA's approval in the U.S. on October 2, 2018 were expensed in research and development and were not included in cost of revenue.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. Prior to the regulatory approval of our product candidates, we incurred expenses for the manufacture of drug product that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of our products. Until the first reporting period when regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered probable, we record all such costs as research and development expense. Inventory used in clinical trials is also expensed as research and development expense when selected for such use. We classify inventory costs as long-term when the we expect to utilize the inventory beyond its normal operating cycle. We perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period and writes down any excess and obsolete inventory to its net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded as a component of cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires the use of estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required.\nAccrued Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed for us and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. Most of our service providers invoice us periodically in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and adjust if necessary. Examples of estimated expenses include fees paid to:\nTable 417: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CROs, in connection with clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 418: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> contract manufacturing organizations with respect to clinical material supply and commercial product;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 419: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> vendors in connection with preclinical development and operational activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 420: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> legal and other professional service providers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contractual arrangements with CROs, professional service firms and other vendors. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe charge costs of our research and development to expense as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of the costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation, facilities, research-related overhead, clinical trial costs, contracted services, manufacturing, license fees and other external costs. Research and development expenses also include gross reimbursable costs incurred through research and development services performed for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, services performed for U.S. manufacturing onshoring and security requirements, and services performed for FDA PMRs under the BARDA contract. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, or ASU 2017-04. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 eliminate the current two-step approach used to test goodwill for impairment and require an entity to apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 (upon the first goodwill impairment test performed during that fiscal year). Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. A reporting entity must apply the amendments in ASU 2017-04 using a prospective approach. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This standard modifies certain disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13. The FASB subsequently issued amendments to ASU 2016-13, which have the same effective date and transition date of January 1, 2023. These standards require that credit losses be reported using an expected losses model rather than the incurred losses model that is currently used, and establishes additional disclosures related to credit risks. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, these standards now require allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. These standards limit the amount of credit losses to be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value and requires the reversal of previously recognized credit losses if fair value increases. Based on the composition of our investment portfolio, accounts receivable and other financial assets, current market conditions and historical credit loss activity, we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss and related disclosures.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nLeases\nWe lease our Boston, Massachusetts and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania office spaces under non-cancelable operating leases expiring in August 2021 and 2024, respectively.\nWe entered into the original King of Prussia and Boston leases in January 2015 and April 2015, respectively. The lease terms under the original agreements were for six and four years, respectively. Each agreement had one renewal option for an extended term. The King of Prussia and Boston lease terms under the original agreements began in June 2015 and July 2015, respectively.\nWe executed an amended lease agreement on our Boston office space in July 2016. The amended lease agreement added 4,153 rentable square feet of office space and extended the original lease term by two years. In accordance with the amended lease agreement, we paid a security deposit of $0.1 million. Subsequent to the amended lease agreement, we record monthly lease expense of approximately $49,000 for the Boston office space.\nWe executed an amended lease agreement on our King of Prussia office space in October 2016. The amended lease agreement is for 19,708 rentable square feet of office space and we took control of such office space during the first quarter of 2017. The total lease commitment is over a seven-year and seven-month lease term. The amended lease agreement contains rent escalation and a partial rent abatement period, which is accounted for as rent expense under the straight-line method. We are required to make additional payments under the facility operating leases for taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period.\nLicenses\nUnder a license agreement with Tufts University, or Tufts, we were required to make aggregate regulatory milestone payments of up to $300,000 associated with the first Phase 3 clinical trials, filing of an NDA, and approval of its first product candidate, all of which have been paid. We are also obligated to pay Tufts a minimum royalty payment in the amount of $25,000 per year. We also agreed to pay Tufts royalties based on gross sales of products, as defined in the agreement, ranging in the low single digits depending on the applicable field of use for such product sale. Also, if we enter into a sublicense under the agreement, based on the applicable field of use for such product, we agreed to pay Tufts a percentage, ranging from 10% to 14 % for compounds other than omadacycline, and a percentage in the single digits for the compound omadacycline, of that portion of any sublicense issue fees or maintenance fees received by us that are reasonably attributable to the sublicense of the rights granted to us under the Tufts License Agreement and the lesser of a percentage, ranging from the low tens to the high twenties based on the applicable field of use for such product, of the royalty payments made to us by the sublicensee or the amount of royalty payments that would have been paid by us to Tufts if we had sold the products.\nIn September 2009, we and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, which merged into Novartis Pharma AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis AG, entered into a Collaborative Development, Manufacture and Commercialization License Agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, which provided Novartis with a global, exclusive patent and technology license for the development, manufacturing and marketing of omadacycline. The Novartis Agreement was terminated by Novartis without cause in June 2011 and the termination was effective 60 days later. We and Novartis subsequently entered in a letter agreement in January 2012, or the Novartis Letter Agreement, as amended, pursuant to which we reconciled shared development costs and expenses and granted Novartis a right of first negotiation with respect to commercialization rights of omadacycline following approval of omadacycline from the FDA, EMA, or any regulatory agency, but only to the extent we had not previously granted such commercialization rights related to omadacycline to another third party as of any such approval. We also agreed to pay Novartis a 0.25% royalty, to be paid from net sales received in any country following the launch of omadacycline in that country and continuing until the later of the expiration of the last active valid patent claim covering such product in the country of sale and 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in such country. The first royalty payment became payable as of March 31, 2019. The amended Novartis Letter Agreement resulted in a long-term liability in the amount of $3.1 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, included within Other Long-Term Liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, short-term liabilities included within Other Current Liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 represent the portion of royalty payments due to Novartis within twelve months of each balance sheet date. There are no other payment obligations to Novartis under either the Novartis Agreement or the amended Novartis Letter Agreement.\nIn February 2020, we entered into an ex-U.S. license agreement with Almirall, the Ex-U.S. License, under which Almirall granted to us an exclusive license in and to certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates in order to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize sarecycline in all countries other than the U.S. In connection with the Ex-U.S. License, we pay Almirall, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis (i) for eight (8) years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country, a royalty in the middle-single digits on our or our affiliates' nets sales of sarecycline products outside of the U.S. (other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), the development and commercialization rights to which for sarecycline in connection with the treatment of acne we exclusively licensed to Almirall), subject to certain standard reductions, and (ii) for fifteen years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country, a percentage of the consideration (e.g., milestones, royalties) we receive from third-party sublicensees in connection with developing and commercializing sarecycline outside of the U.S., which ranges from one-half of such consideration for sarecycline products for the treatment of acne to one-fifth of such consideration for sarecycline products for the treatment of other indications, in each case subject to a 50% reduction for any sarecycline product not in a solid oral tablet formulation for which Paratek or its affiliates have incurred significant development costs and (ii) for eight years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country, a royalty in the middle-single digits on our or our affiliates' net sales of sarecycline products outside of the U.S., subject to certain standard reductions.\nLong-Term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had recorded long-term debt obligations of $250.5 million, net of debt discount and issuance costs of $7.0 million. Debt issuance costs are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than capitalized as an asset in accordance with ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\nR-Bridge Loan Agreement\nOn December 31, 2020, or the Closing Date, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary PRTK SPV2 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or the Subsidiary, entered into a royalty and revenue interest-backed loan agreement with an affiliate of R-Bridge Healthcare Investment Advisory, Ltd., herein referred to as the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, the Subsidiary borrowed a $60.0 million term loan, secured by, and repaid with proceeds from, (i) royalties from our license agreement with Zai Labs (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or the Zai Collaboration Agreement, and such royalties, or the Royalty Interest, and (ii) a revenue interest based on our U.S. sales of NUZYRA in an initial amount of two and a half percent (2.5%), which amount may adjust under certain circumstances up to five percent (5%), of our net U.S. sales, subject to an annual cap of $10.0 million, which may adjust under certain circumstances to $12.0 million, or the Revenue Interest.\nUnder the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance will bear interest at an annual rate of 7.0%, increasing to an annual rate of 10% during the continuance of any event of default. Payments of the obligations outstanding under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement will be made quarterly, beginning with the payment due in respect of the quarter ending March 31, 2021, out of the Royalty Interest payments and Revenue Interest payments received by the Subsidiary during such quarter, or the Collection Amount. On each payment date, after payment of certain expenses, the Collection Amount shall be applied first to accrued interest, with any excess up to $15.0 million per annum applied to repay principal until the balance is fully repaid, and any shortfalls being capitalized and added to the principal balance of the loan. Amounts in excess of the $15.0 million annual cap shall be shared between us and R-Bridge Healthcare Investment Advisory, Ltd., or the R-Bridge Lender, based on a formula set out in the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. Following repayment in full of the loan, the first $15.0 million per annum in Collection Amount shall be paid to us and any amounts in excess shall be shared between us and the R-Bridge Lender based on a formula set out in the R-Bridge Loan Agreement.\nPrior to the eighth (8th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the R-Bridge Loan Agreement will automatically terminate once the Subsidiary has paid to the R-Bridge Lender, in the form of regularly scheduled payments or as a voluntary prepayment, a capped amount of $114 million, less principal, interest and certain fee payments through the date of such prepayment, or the Capped Amount. After the eighth (8th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Revenue Interest can be terminated but the Royalty Interest payments shall continue until maturity of the R-Bridge Loan Agreement on December 31, 2032, at which time, the outstanding principal amount of the loan, if any, together\nwith any accrued and unpaid interest, and all other obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable in cash by the Subsidiary.\nOur subsidiary, PRTK SPV1 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and owner of the Subsidiary's capital stock, has entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement in favor of the R-Bridge Lender, pursuant to which the Subsidiary's obligations under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement are secured by PRTK SPV1 LLC's pledge of all of the Subsidiary's capital stock.\nThe R-Bridge Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants, including those relating to: use of proceeds\u037e maintenance of books and records\u037e financial reporting and notification\u037e compliance with laws\u037e and protection of Company intellectual property. The R-Bridge Loan Agreement also contains certain customary negative covenants, barring the Subsidiary from: certain fundamental transactions\u037e issuing dividends and distributions\u037e incurring additional indebtedness outside of the ordinary course of business\u037e engaging in any business activity other than related to the Zai Collaboration Agreement\u037e and permitting any additional liens on the collateral provided to the R-Bridge Lender under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement.\nAn ancillary agreement executed by us and the Subsidiary in respect of the Revenue Interest, contains negative covenants applicable to us, including restrictions on the sale or transfer of our assets related to NUZYRA and giving rise to the Revenue Interest, each subject to the exceptions set forth therein.\nThe R-Bridge Loan Agreement contains customary defined events of default, upon which any outstanding principal, unpaid interest and other obligations of the Subsidiary, shall be immediately due and payable by the Subsidiary. These include: failure to pay any principal or interest when due\u037e failure to the Capped Amount as and when due following a non-qualified change of control, any uncured breach of a representation, warranty or covenant\u037e any uncured failure to perform or observe covenants\u037e any uncured breach of our representations, warranties or covenants under an ancillary agreement executed by the us and the Subsidiary in respect of the Royalty Interest\u037e any termination of the Zai Collaboration Agreement\u037e and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events. No events of default had occurred under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement through December 31, 2020.\nThe net proceeds of the term loan were used by the Subsidiary to purchase from the Company the Royalty Interest and Revenue Interest, pursuant to the terms of the Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement and the Contribution and Servicing Agreement, respectively. We raised approximately $58.3 million in net proceeds in connection with the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, comprised of the $60.0 million term loan funded at execution, net of $1.1 million in lender fees accounted for as debt discount and $0.6 million in direct and incremental third-party expenses accounted for as debt issuance costs. The net proceeds of the term loan, together with cash on hand, was used to prepay in full all obligations outstanding under the loan arrangement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nConvertible Senior Subordinated Notes\nOn April 18, 2018, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with the Initial Purchasers for whom Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Leerink Partners LLC acted as representatives, relating to the sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers. We also granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on April 20, 2018.\nThe Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities.\nIn addition, J. Wood Capital Advisors LLC, our financial advisor, purchased $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes in a separate, concurrent private placement on the same terms as other investors.\nThe Notes were issued by us on April 23, 2018, pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of such date, or the Indenture, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, or the Trustee. The Notes bear cash interest at the annual rate of 4.75%, payable on November 1 and May 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018, and mature on May 1, 2024 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. We will settle conversions of the Notes through delivery of shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 62.8931 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment as provided for in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $15.90 per share, representing a conversion premium of approximately 20% above the closing price of the common stock of $13.25 per share on April 18, 2018.\nHolders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to May 6, 2021. We may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes, at its option, on or after May 6, 2021 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nIf we experience a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, prior to the maturity date of the Notes, holders of the Notes will, subject to specified conditions, have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the Notes and following a notice of redemption of the Notes, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such corporate event or redemption.\nThe Indenture provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default with respect to the Notes arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other event of default with respect to the Notes under the Indenture occurs or is continuing, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of the Notes to be immediately due and payable.\nIn certain circumstances if, at any time during the six-month period beginning on, and including, the date that is six months after the last date of original issuance of the Notes, we fail to timely file certain documents or reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Notes are not otherwise freely tradable by holders of the Notes other than our affiliates or holders that were our affiliates at any time during the three months immediately preceding, additional interest will accrue on the Notes during the first 90-day period in which its failure to file has occurred and is continuing or such Notes are not otherwise freely tradable by holders other than the our affiliates (or holders that were our affiliates at any time during the three months immediately preceding).\nAfter deducting costs incurred of $6.0 million, we raised net proceeds from the issuance of long-term convertible debt of $159.0 million in April 2018. All costs were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the Notes at an effective interest rate of 5.47% and recorded as additional interest expense.\nRoyalty-Backed Loan Agreement\nOn February 25, 2019, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Paratek Royalty Corporation, or the Subsidiary, entered into a royalty-backed loan agreement, or the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P., or HCRP. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth therein, the Subsidiary borrowed a $32.5 million loan, which was secured by, and will be repaid based upon, royalties from the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. On May 1, 2019, we received $27.8 million, net of $0.5 million lender discount, $0.2 million in lender expenses incurred, and $4.0 million that was deposited into an interest reserve account. We also paid $1.2 million in other lender fees related to the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nUnder the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance will bear interest at an annual rate of 12.0%. Payments of interest under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement are made quarterly out of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement royalty payments received since the immediately preceding payment date. On each interest payment date, any royalty payments in excess of accrued interest on the loan will be used to repay the principal of the loan until the balance is fully repaid. In addition, the Subsidiary made up-front payments to HCRP of (i) a 1.5% fee and (ii) up to $300,000 for HCRP's expenses. The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement matures on May 1, 2029, at which time, if not earlier repaid in full, the outstanding principal amount of the loan, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, and all other obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable in cash. We entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement in favor of HCRP, pursuant to which the Subsidiary's obligations under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of all of our holdings of the Subsidiary's capital stock.\nThe Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants, including those relating to: use of proceeds\u037e maintenance of books and records\u037e financial reporting and notification\u037e compliance with laws\u037e and protection of our intellectual property. The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement also contains certain customary negative covenants, barring the Subsidiary from: certain fundamental transactions\u037e issuing dividends and distributions\u037e incurring additional indebtedness outside of the ordinary course of business\u037e engaging in any business activity other than related to the Almirall Collaboration Agreement\u037e and permitting any additional liens on the collateral provided to HCRP under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nThe Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement contains customary defined events of default, upon which any outstanding principal and unpaid interest shall be immediately due and payable. These include: failure to pay any principal or interest when due\u037e any uncured breach of a representation, warranty or covenant\u037e any uncured failure to perform or observe covenants\u037e any uncured cross default under a material contract\u037e any uncured breach of our representations, warranties or covenants under its Contribution and Servicing Agreement with the Subsidiary\u037e any termination of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement\u037e and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events.\nContract Service Providers\nIn the course of normal business operations, we also have agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing and other activities for operating purposes which are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days' prior written notice. These payments are not included in this table of contractual obligations.\nWe could also enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, manufacturing, supplier and contractor agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and/or long-term commitments of cash.\nCommercial Supply Agreements\nWe have entered into multiple commercial supply agreements.

The change in net cash used in operating activities primarily consists of our net losses adjusted for non-cash items and changes in components of operating assets and liabilities as follows:\n \u2022 $58.7 million in net proceeds received from the R-Bridge Loan Agreement; offset by \n \u2022 potential changes in government regulation; and \nWe also continue to pursue a number of other opportunities for NUZYRA. The first of these is the filing with the FDA of a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, for the oral-only loading dose regimen for patients diagnosed with CABP. The sNDA includes the results of a study designed with agreement from the FDA to show that an oral-only loading dose regimen will have a comparable pharmacokinetic profile to the approved IV loading dose regimen in patients with CABP that was established in the Phase 3 registration study. Enrollment in this study was stopped early in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions at the clinical centers. Data obtained from the study was reviewed and determined to support the submission of the sNDA in July 2020. We believe consideration for this oral-only loading dose regimen is expected during the second quarter of 2021.\n \u2022 our need and ability to hire additional management, scientific, commercial, operations and medical personnel; \nIf an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent or include a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised.\n \u2022 allocated facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies; and \nUnder a license agreement with Tufts University, or Tufts, we were required to make aggregate regulatory milestone payments of up to $300,000 associated with the first Phase 3 clinical trials, filing of an NDA, and approval of its first product candidate, all of which have been paid. We are also obligated to pay Tufts a minimum royalty payment in the amount of $25,000 per year. We also agreed to pay Tufts royalties based on gross sales of products, as defined in the agreement, ranging in the low single digits depending on the applicable field of use for such product sale. Also, if we enter into a sublicense under the agreement, based on the applicable field of use for such product, we agreed to pay Tufts a percentage, ranging from 10% to 14 % for compounds other than omadacycline, and a percentage in the single digits for the compound omadacycline, of that portion of any sublicense issue fees or maintenance fees received by us that are reasonably attributable to the sublicense of the rights granted to us under the Tufts License Agreement and the lesser of a percentage, ranging from the low tens to the high twenties based on the applicable field of use for such product, of the royalty payments made to us by the sublicensee or the amount of royalty payments that would have been paid by us to Tufts if we had sold the products.\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2019, a net loss of $128.8 million was adjusted for non-cash items including $14.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and $3.5 million of non-cash interest expense, offset by $1.3 million in net depreciation, amortization and accretion, and a net decrease of $21.7 million due to changes in operating assets and liability. The significant items in the change in operations assets and liabilities include an increase in accounts receivable, other receivables, prepaid, and other current assets of $11.5 million and an increase in inventories of $10.9 million. \nIn assessing whether a constraint is necessary, the Company considers both the likelihood and the magnitude of the revenue reversal. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company's estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the Company's estimates, the Company adjusts these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. The specific considerations the Company uses in estimating these amounts related to variable consideration associated with the Company's products are as follows:\nWe executed an amended lease agreement on our King of Prussia office space in October 2016. The amended lease agreement is for 19,708 rentable square feet of office space and we took control of such office space during the first quarter of 2017. The total lease commitment is over a seven-year and seven-month lease term. The amended lease agreement contains rent escalation and a partial rent abatement period, which is accounted for as rent expense under the straight-line method. We are required to make additional payments under the facility operating leases for taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period.\nItem 7.\nWe have used and we intend to continue to use the net proceeds from the above offerings of our common stock and the Notes, as well as other current and retired long-term debt agreements, together with our existing capital resources and future NUZYRA product sales, government contract revenue and royalty revenue, to fund our\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product and royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through a combination of public or private equity\nOur third-party contract manufacturing partners continue to operate their manufacturing facilities at or near normal levels. While we currently do not anticipate any interruptions in our supply chain, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our and/or our third-party suppliers' and contract manufacturing partners' ability to manufacture our products or the products of our partners. The COVID-19 pandemic has prevented technical service, quality assurance and supply operations personnel from traveling to our third-party contract manufacturing partners in Europe.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, or ASU 2017-04. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 eliminate the current two-step approach used to test goodwill for impairment and require an entity to apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 (upon the first goodwill impairment test performed during that fiscal year). Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. A reporting entity must apply the amendments in ASU 2017-04 using a prospective approach. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nCost of product revenue was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $5.2 million increase is primarily the result of an increase in NUZYRA product sales, NUZYRA sample program shipments, royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA, and certain period costs. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, certain of the costs of NUZYRA units recognized as revenue during years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were expensed prior to FDA approval in October 2018, and therefore are not included in cost of product revenue during the periods. We expect cost of product revenue to increase in absolute dollars as product revenue increases.\nCost of product revenue represents the cost of the product itself, labor and overhead, and any reserve for excess or obsolete inventory, as well as stability studies, inventory scrap and royalty expense. Cost of product revenue also represents royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA.\n \u2022 future clinical trial results; \nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents interest incurred on the Notes of $8.8 million, the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement of $7.3 million, the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement of $4.0 million and interest expense related to our money market funds and marketable securities of $0.1 million.

After the eighth (8th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Revenue Interest can be terminated but the Royalty Interest payments shall continue until maturity of the R-Bridge Loan Agreement on December 31, 2032, at which time, the outstanding principal amount of the loan, if any, together\nWe began generating revenue from product sales when we launched NUZYRA in the U.S. in February 2019 and from royalties on net sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. when Almirall launched the product in January 2019. Our future funding requirements will depend on our ability to generate continued revenue from sales of NUZYRA, and our partner, Almirall's, ability to generate continued revenue from sales of SEYSARA, with respect to which we are entitled to tiered royalties in the U.S. and flat royalties in the greater China region. We do not expect to generate any other revenue unless and until our omadacycline greater China region partner, Zai, and our SEYSARA greater China region partner, Almirall, obtains regulatory approval of and commercializes its respective product in the greater China region. Zai submitted the first regulatory approval application for a licensed product in the People's Republic of China in December 2019, which was accepted by the China NMPA in February 2020 and, in April 2020, the NMPA granted priority review status for its application. We will require substantial additional funding to meet FDA PMRs for NUZYRA, which we expect to continue to be funded through the BARDA contract. Additional resources will also be needed to support and accelerate the commercialization of NUZYRA, fund the development of omadacycline in other indications, including NTM and pulmonary anthrax, and to advance the development of potential other product candidates, and such funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all. BARDA's procurement of NUZYRA for the SNS will also be an important component to satisfying future funding requirements. While it is difficult to predict with certainty, on February 24, 2021, we announced that the initial NUZYRA procurement for the SNS under our contract with BARDA was expected to occur in the first half of 2021 and another procurement in the second half of 2021. The initial procurement is contingent upon receipt of comments from the FDA on the pre-emergency use authorization, or pre-EUA, submitted in February 2020. As part of the ongoing review, supplemental mouse pharmacokinetic data requested by the FDA was submitted in November 2020. On March 2, 2021, we received feedback from the FDA with a recommendation to consider an additional in vitro model to further characterize the optimal pharmacokinetic parameters for pulmonary anthrax as part of the development program. We are in discussions with BARDA to align on the best approach to integrating the FDA recommendation into the development program. BARDA is working with FDA to satisfy BARDA's requirement that the status of the current pre-EUA will enable them to initiate the first procurement into the SNS. Once the initial procurement is completed, the timing of future procurements is not expected to be impacted.\nThe Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants, including those relating to: use of proceeds\u037e maintenance of books and records\u037e financial reporting and notification\u037e compliance with laws\u037e and protection of our intellectual property. The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement also contains certain customary negative covenants, barring the Subsidiary from: certain fundamental transactions\u037e issuing dividends and distributions\u037e incurring additional indebtedness outside of the ordinary course of business\u037e engaging in any business activity other than related to the Almirall Collaboration Agreement\u037e and permitting any additional liens on the collateral provided to HCRP under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nResearch and development expenses consisted primarily of costs directly incurred by us for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nCommercial Payer and Other Rebates - The Company plans to continue to contract with certain private payer organizations, primarily insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of NUZYRA and contracted formulary status. The Company estimates these rebates and records reserves for such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized. Currently, the reserve for customer payer rebates considers future utilization based on third-party studies of payer prescription data; the utilization is applied to product that remains in the distribution and retail pharmacy channel inventories at the end of each reporting period. As the Company distributes its product and establishes historical sales over a longer period of time (i.e., two years), the Company will be able to place more reliance on historical data related to commercial payer rebates (i.e., actual utilization units) while continuing to rely on third-party data related to payer prescriptions and utilization.\n \u2022 costs required to ensure that our and our partners' business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations; \nFinancial Operations Overview\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist stockholders and investors reading the consolidated financial statements in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nProduct Revenue, Net\n \u2022 the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals. \nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of us or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nCollaboration and royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of $1.3 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. by Almirall under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), and $0.2 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of XERAVA in the U.S. by Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. under the Tetraphase License Agreement (as defined below). Fourth quarter royalty revenue recognized for sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. was estimated using third-party data and an approximation of discounts and allowances to calculate net product sales, to which the Company then applied the applicable royalty percentage specified in the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted in the period in which they become known, which is expected to be the following quarter.\n \u2022 direct employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense of our research and development personnel; \nData generation will continue to expand throughout 2021 with additional evidence from our IIR programs in areas such as diabetic foot and C. difficile infections. In addition, non-clinical research studying the activity of omadacycline alone and in combination in an osteomyelitis model in rats and studies in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium avium complex, or MAC, will build on the growing library of scientific data for NUZYRA.\n \u2022 the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy generally and on our business and operations specifically, including our sales of NUZYRA, sales by our collaboration partners with respect to which we are entitled to royalties, our third-party manufacturers and supply chain, our research and development efforts, our clinical trials and our employees. \n \u2022 royalty revenue received from commercial sales of SEYSARA by Almirall; \nResearch and Development Expense\n \u2022 the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical study materials and developing manufacturing processes; \nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our products or product candidates for which we or any partner obtain regulatory approval, such as NUZYRA and SEYSARA. Aside from the FDA approval of NUZYRA and SEYSARA in the U.S., we or our partners may never succeed in achieving other regulatory approvals for NUZYRA, or any of our other product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\nAfter deducting costs incurred of $6.0 million, we raised net proceeds from the issuance of long-term convertible debt of $159.0 million in April 2018. All costs were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the Notes at an effective interest rate of 5.47% and recorded as additional interest expense.\n</table>\nInventory\nIn February 2020, we entered into an ex-U.S. license agreement with Almirall, the Ex-U.S. License, under which Almirall granted to us an exclusive license in and to certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates in order to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize sarecycline in all countries other than the U.S. In connection with the Ex-U.S. License, we pay Almirall, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis (i) for eight (8) years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country, a royalty in the middle-single digits on our or our affiliates' nets sales of sarecycline products outside of the U.S. (other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), the development and commercialization rights to which for sarecycline in connection with the treatment of acne we exclusively licensed to Almirall), subject to certain standard reductions, and (ii) for fifteen years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country, a percentage of the consideration (e.g., milestones, royalties) we receive from third-party sublicensees in connection with developing and commercializing sarecycline outside of the U.S., which ranges from one-half of such consideration for sarecycline products for the treatment of acne to one-fifth of such consideration for sarecycline products for the treatment of other indications, in each case subject to a 50% reduction for any sarecycline product not in a solid oral tablet formulation for which Paratek or its affiliates have incurred significant development costs and (ii) for eight years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country, a royalty in the middle-single digits on our or our affiliates' net sales of sarecycline products outside of the U.S., subject to certain standard reductions.\n \u2022 $21.9 million in net proceeds raised through the sale of shares of our common stock through the 2019 Sales Agreement; and \nLicenses of intellectual property\nongoing company operations, including clinical studies of omadacycline, NUZYRA commercial operations, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The Company estimates our Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payer mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related product revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability that is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. For Medicare, the Company also estimates the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom it will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. The Company's liability for these rebates consists of an estimate of claims for the current quarter and estimated future claims that will be made for product sales that have been recognized as revenue but remain in distribution channel inventory at period end.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2019 includes the following:\nTo date, we and our partners have been able to continue to supply our products to our patients worldwide and currently do not anticipate any interruptions in supply for the foreseeable future. Regarding our clinical programs, enrollment in our study designed to show that an oral-only loading dose regimen will have a comparable pharmacokinetic profile to the approved IV loading dose regimen in patients with CABP that was established in the Phase 3 registration study was stopped early in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions at the clinical centers. We continue to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, including our sales, expenses, supply chain and other clinical studies.\nThe following table summarizes our cash provided by and (used in) operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\nTo date, we have devoted a substantial amount of our resources to research and development efforts, including conducting clinical trials for omadacycline, protecting our intellectual property and providing selling, general and administrative support for these operations. We have historically financed our operations primarily through sales of our common stock, debt financings, strategic collaborations, and grant funding. We began generating revenue from product sales in February 2019.\n\nCustomer options\nOn February 24, 2021, we announced that the initial NUZYRA procurement for the SNS under our contract with BARDA was expected to occur in the first half of 2021 and another procurement in the second half of 2021. The initial procurement is contingent upon receipt of comments from the FDA on the pre-emergency use authorization, or pre-EUA, submitted in February 2020. As part of the ongoing review, supplemental mouse pharmacokinetic data requested by the FDA was submitted in November 2020. On March 2, 2021, we received feedback from the FDA with a recommendation to consider an additional in vitro model to further characterize the optimal pharmacokinetic parameters for pulmonary anthrax as part of the development program. We are in discussions with BARDA to align on the best approach to integrating the FDA recommendation into the development program. BARDA is working with FDA to satisfy BARDA's requirement that the status of the current pre-EUA will enable them to initiate the first procurement into the SNS. Once the initial procurement is completed, the timing of future procurements is not expected to be impacted.\n \u2022 the costs associated with manufacturing and maintaining high quality sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; \nOn December 31, 2020, we used the proceeds from the sale of the Royalty Interest and Revenue Interest from the R-Bridge Loan Agreement (as defined below), together with cash on hand, to prepay in full all obligations outstanding under the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement. Repayment of all amounts outstanding under the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement qualified as an extinguishment of debt on the date the payment was made in satisfaction of all amounts due and we were unconditionally relieved of our obligations therein. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million was calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt, which includes any unamortized debt discount and issuance costs.\nCost of Product Revenue\n \u2022 CROs, in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 Product returns \nIf the Company concludes that some or all aspects of its government contracts represent a transaction with a customer to obtain services or goods that are an output of its ordinary activities in exchange for consideration, it accounts for those aspects of the arrangement in accordance with ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. Arrangements that are entirely in the scope of other guidance are accounted for under that guidance.\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel life-saving therapies for life-threatening diseases or other public health threats for civilian, government and military use. Our United States, or U.S., Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved commercial product, NUZYRA\u00ae (omadacycline) is a once-daily oral and intravenous antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP, and acute skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI, caused by susceptible pathogens. SEYSARA\u00ae (sarecycline) is an FDA-approved product with respect to which we have exclusively licensed in the U.S. and the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Macau, or the greater China region, certain rights to Almirall, LLC, or Almirall. SEYSARA is currently being marketed by Almirall in the U.S. as a once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. With respect to our technology as it relates to sarecycline, we retain development and commercialization rights in all countries other than the U.S. and the greater China region, and in February 2020, we exclusively licensed from Almirall certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates that is necessary or useful to develop or commercialize sarecycline outside of the U.S. Almirall plans to develop sarecycline for acne in China, with a submission to the China National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, expected in 2023.\nAt the end of each reporting period for any of our products, the Company may decide to constrain revenue for product returns based on information from various sources, including channel inventory levels and dating and sell-through data, the expiration dates of product currently being shipped, price changes of competitive products and introductions of generic products.\nOn April 18, 2018, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with the Initial Purchasers for whom Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Leerink Partners LLC acted as representatives, relating to the sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers. We also granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on April 20, 2018.\nProduct revenue, net, is recognized when earned on sales of NUZYRA, which was approved by the FDA in October 2018 and launched in the U.S. in February 2019. NUZYRA is sold principally to a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers in the U.S. These customers subsequently resell our product to health care providers or dispense the product to patients. In addition to distribution agreements with customers, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of our product. Product revenue is recognized net of reserves for all variable consideration, including rebates, chargebacks, discounts and product returns.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to May 6, 2021. We may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes, at its option, on or after May 6, 2021 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n \u2022 add personnel to support the business as we expand our commercial footprint and commercial footprint; \n \u2022 the economic and other terms, timing and success of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future, including the timing of receipt of any milestone or royalty payments under such arrangements; and \n \u2022 continue to augment our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize NUZYRA and increase our manufacturing capacity and capabilities to satisfy demand; \nLoss on extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement, which included any unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, recognized upon termination.\n \u2022 Commercial payer and other rebates \n \u2022 the costs and timing of commercialization activities for NUZYRA; \nCompany Overview\n a) The expected value\u201d is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. Under ASC 606, an expected value may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the Company has many contracts with similar characteristics. \nOur subsidiary, PRTK SPV1 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and owner of the Subsidiary's capital stock, has entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement in favor of the R-Bridge Lender, pursuant to which the Subsidiary's obligations under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement are secured by PRTK SPV1 LLC's pledge of all of the Subsidiary's capital stock.\nBased upon our current operating plan, we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $125.2 million as of December 31, 2020, will extend our cash runway through the end of 2023 with a pathway to cash flow break even.\nIn certain circumstances if, at any time during the six-month period beginning on, and including, the date that is six months after the last date of original issuance of the Notes, we fail to timely file certain documents or reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Notes are not otherwise freely tradable by holders of the Notes other than our affiliates or holders that were our affiliates at any time during the three months immediately preceding, additional interest will accrue on the Notes during the first 90-day period in which its failure to file has occurred and is continuing or such Notes are not otherwise freely tradable by holders other than the our affiliates (or holders that were our affiliates at any time during the three months immediately preceding).\nofferings, debt or other structured financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. We do not have any committed external sources of funds other than the rights under the BARDA contract and the rights to contingent milestone payments and/or royalties under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, the Almirall China License, the Tetraphase License Agreement and the Zai Collaboration Agreement, which are terminable by Almirall, Tetraphase and Zai, respectively, upon prior written notice. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect stockholders' rights. Future debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Additionally, future equity or debt financing may be difficult to obtain on favorable terms, if at all, in light of increased volatility within the global financial markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, NUZYRA, sarecycline, future revenue streams, research programs, product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market NUZYRA, sarecycline or our other product candidates that we may otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nThe method selected is applied consistently throughout the contract when estimating the effect of an uncertainty on an amount of variable consideration. In addition, the Company considers all the information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company and shall identify a reasonable number of possible consideration amounts. The relevant factors used in this determination include, but are not limited to, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns.\n \u2022 our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems; \nWe have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our pharmaceutical products, especially given the constraints on in-person promotion of NUZYRA and reduced access to prescribers due to restrictions in access to hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the unknown extent to which we will maintain existing or enter into new collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our product and product candidates, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures that we will require to fund our continuing operations, including for our clinical development programs and commercialization efforts for NUZYRA. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nRoyalties\n \u2022 seek regulatory approvals for additional indications for omadacycline, such as omadacycline for the treatment of NTM and pulmonary anthrax; \n \u2022 costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory compliance. \nWe entered into the original King of Prussia and Boston leases in January 2015 and April 2015, respectively. The lease terms under the original agreements were for six and four years, respectively. Each agreement had one renewal option for an extended term. The King of Prussia and Boston lease terms under the original agreements began in June 2015 and July 2015, respectively.\nWe base our expenses on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contractual arrangements with CROs, professional service firms and other vendors. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\n \u2022 Voluntary patient assistance programs \nInterest Expense\nAn ancillary agreement executed by us and the Subsidiary in respect of the Revenue Interest, contains negative covenants applicable to us, including restrictions on the sale or transfer of our assets related to NUZYRA and giving rise to the Revenue Interest, each subject to the exceptions set forth therein.\nR-Bridge Loan Agreement\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that therapeutic candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority, were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of the clinical development of product candidates, or if we experience significant delays in the enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nIn September 2009, we and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, which merged into Novartis Pharma AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis AG, entered into a Collaborative Development, Manufacture and Commercialization License Agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, which provided Novartis with a global, exclusive patent and technology license for the development, manufacturing and marketing of omadacycline. The Novartis Agreement was terminated by Novartis without cause in June 2011 and the termination was effective 60 days later. We and Novartis subsequently entered in a letter agreement in January 2012, or the Novartis Letter Agreement, as amended, pursuant to which we reconciled shared development costs and expenses and granted Novartis a right of first negotiation with respect to commercialization rights of omadacycline following approval of omadacycline from the FDA, EMA, or any regulatory agency, but only to the extent we had not previously granted such commercialization rights related to omadacycline to another third party as of any such approval. We also agreed to pay Novartis a 0.25% royalty, to be paid from net sales received in any country following the launch of omadacycline in that country and continuing until the later of the expiration of the last active valid patent claim covering such product in the country of sale and 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in such country. The first royalty payment became payable as of March 31, 2019. The amended Novartis Letter Agreement resulted in a long-term liability in the amount of $3.1 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, included within Other Long-Term Liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, short-term liabilities included within Other Current Liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 represent the portion of royalty payments due to Novartis within twelve months of each balance sheet date. There are no other payment obligations to Novartis under either the Novartis Agreement or the amended Novartis Letter Agreement.\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2020, a net loss of $96.5 million was adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense of $10.2 million, non-cash interest expense of $1.5 million, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 million, and a net decrease of $20.3 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The significant items in the change in operating assets and liabilities include an increase in accounts receivable, other receivables, prepaid, and other current assets of $7.5 million and an increase in inventories of $11.8 million. \nOn May 11, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, as amended on June 19, 2020 and declared effective on July 9, 2020, to sell certain of our securities in an aggregate amount of up to $250.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, $250.0 million remains available on this shelf registration statement.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to, among other items, accounts receivable and related reserves, inventory and related reserves, accrued sales allowances, net product revenue, government contract service revenue, government contract grant revenue, SEYSARA royalty revenue, leases, stock-based compensation arrangements, manufacturing and clinical accruals, useful lives for depreciation and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOther Income and Expenses\n \u2022 resources required to develop and implement policies and processes to promote ongoing compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations; \nGovernment contract service revenue is recognized when earned under our BARDA contract and represents the reimbursement by BARDA of costs incurred by us for work performed to develop NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax plus a small fixed administrative fee. Refer to Note 5, Government Contract Revenue in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the BARDA contract and related revenue recognition.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of $237.0 million in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, offset by $102.2 million of investments in marketable securities (U.S. treasury securities).\n \u2022 the ability of Zai to develop, manufacture and commercialize omadacycline in the Zai territory; \nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all the royalty has been allocated is satisfied (or partially satisfied).\n \u2022 $26.6 million in net proceeds raised through the sale of shares of our common stock through the 2019 Sales Agreement. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is continuing to affect our employees, health care institutions, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The COVID-19 related restrictions on in-person promotional access to health care institutions and the overall impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the health care and hospital environments could restrict the full potential of NUZYRA's growth. The length of time and full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.\nCollaboration and royalty revenue were $1.5 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nCollaboration and Royalty Revenue\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company's product, which typically occurs once the Company has transferred physical possession of the good to the customer. The transaction price that the Company recognizes as revenue reflects the amount it expects to be entitled to in connection with the sale and transfer of control of product to its customers. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. At the time that the Company's customers take control of the product, which is when the Company's performance obligation under the sales contracts is complete, the Company records product revenues net of applicable reserves for various types of variable consideration based on the Company's estimates of channel mix. The types of variable consideration in our product revenue are as follows:\n \u2022 the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we may pursue; \nLicenses\nIf we experience a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, prior to the maturity date of the Notes, holders of the Notes will, subject to specified conditions, have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the Notes and following a notice of redemption of the Notes, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such corporate event or redemption.\nAccrued Expenses\n \u2022 vendors in connection with preclinical development and operational activities; and \nThe allocated consideration of government contract grant revenue is recognized as the related reimbursable expenses are incurred. The cost reimbursements that are reported as revenue is presented gross of the related reimbursable expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The related reimbursable expenses are expensed as incurred as research and development expense.\nInterest Income\nPatient Assistance - The Company offers certain voluntary patient assistance programs for prescriptions, such as co-pay assistance programs, which are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payers. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that the Company expects to receive associated with product sale that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution and pharmacy channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.\nAs part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the transaction price under step (iii) above and (b) the timing of revenue recognition, including the appropriate measure of progress, in step (v) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties, should be included in the transaction price, as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, we generally allocate the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.\nFinancing Activities\nResearch and development expenses also include gross reimbursable costs incurred related to research and development services performed for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, services performed for U.S. manufacturing onshoring and security requirements, and services performed for FDA PMRs under the BARDA contract.\nGovernment Contract Service Revenue\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest income represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities.\nWe manage certain activities, such as clinical trial operations, manufacture of clinical trial material, and preclinical animal toxicology studies, through third-party contract organizations. The only costs we track by each product candidate are external costs such as services provided to us by CROs, manufacturing of preclinical and clinical drug product, and other outsourced research and development expenses. We do not assign or allocate to individual development programs internal costs such as salaries and benefits, facilities costs, lab supplies and the costs of preclinical research and studies. Our research and development expenses for omadacycline and other projects during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nGovernment contract service revenue earned under our BARDA contract was $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. No such government contract service revenue was earned during the year ended December 31, 2019 as the BARDA contract was executed in December 2019.\nOn February 25, 2019, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Paratek Royalty Corporation, or the Subsidiary, entered into a royalty-backed loan agreement, or the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P., or HCRP. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth therein, the Subsidiary borrowed a $32.5 million loan, which was secured by, and will be repaid based upon, royalties from the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. On May 1, 2019, we received $27.8 million, net of $0.5 million lender discount, $0.2 million in lender expenses incurred, and $4.0 million that was deposited into an interest reserve account. We also paid $1.2 million in other lender fees related to the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nWhile our BARDA contract is expected to significantly strengthen our cash position, unless we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our commercial products, we may need to raise additional capital in order to support and accelerate the commercialization of omadacycline and to advance the development of our other indications for omadacycline, such as NTM, or other product candidates. If we cannot generate a sufficient amount of product or royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt or other structured financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. We may be unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, which would force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our development programs or commercialization efforts. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never be able to do so.\nCost of Product Revenue\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed for us and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. Most of our service providers invoice us periodically in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and adjust if necessary. Examples of estimated expenses include fees paid to:\nIn the course of normal business operations, we also have agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing and other activities for operating purposes which are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days' prior written notice. These payments are not included in this table of contractual obligations.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nCollaboration and royalty revenue are recognized when revenue earned under our collaboration and license agreements. Refer to Note 6, License and Collaboration Agreements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the collaboration agreements and the related revenue recognition.\nRoyalty-Backed Loan Agreement\n \u2022 Government rebates \nWe have made significant progress in the pulmonary anthrax development program under the BARDA contract. A pharmacokinetic, or PK, study in rabbits was recently completed, which will lead into the pilot efficacy studies in this species. In addition, we have evaluated minimum inhibitory concentrations, or MICs, of omadacycline against approximately 100 anthrax strains. Omadacycline continued to demonstrate potent MICs and is considered effective against all bacteria tested. The collection of isolates had a strain resistant to doxycycline and a strain resistant to ciprofloxacin, the two antibiotics currently in the SNS after approval for the treatment of anthrax many years ago. Omadacycline activity was not impacted in either of those resistant strains.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains certain statements that are not strictly historical and are forward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to other risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements included in this section are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement, except as required by law.\nCollaboration and royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was comprised of a $3.0 million milestone payment earned under the Zai Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), upon submission of the first regulatory approval application for a licensed product in the People's Republic of China in December 2019, $1.9 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. by Almirall under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), and $0.1 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of XERAVA in the U.S. by Tetraphase under the Tetraphase License Agreement. Fourth quarter royalty revenue recognized for sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. was estimated using third party data and an approximation of discounts and allowances to calculate net product sales, to which we then applied the applicable royalty percentage specified in the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is expected to be the following quarter.\n \u2022 the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we may pursue; \nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGovernment Contract Grant Revenue\n \u2022 $0.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options; \nContract Service Providers\nThe R-Bridge Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants, including those relating to: use of proceeds\u037e maintenance of books and records\u037e financial reporting and notification\u037e compliance with laws\u037e and protection of Company intellectual property. The R-Bridge Loan Agreement also contains certain customary negative covenants, barring the Subsidiary from: certain fundamental transactions\u037e issuing dividends and distributions\u037e incurring additional indebtedness outside of the ordinary course of business\u037e engaging in any business activity other than related to the Zai Collaboration Agreement\u037e and permitting any additional liens on the collateral provided to the R-Bridge Lender under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement.\n \u2022 $0.6 million in net proceeds raised through the 2018 ESPP (as defined below); \nCollaboration and Royalty Revenue\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nProduct Revenue, Net\nAccounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied as services are rendered.\nCommercial Supply Agreements\nFor additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this report.\n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of seeking, obtaining, maintaining and expanding FDA and non-U.S. regulatory approvals; \nThe Indenture provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default with respect to the Notes arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other event of default with respect to the Notes under the Indenture occurs or is continuing, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of the Notes to be immediately due and payable.\n \u2022 build product inventory; and \n \u2022 the effect of competing products that may limit market penetration of our products; \nMilestone payments\nStart-up activities for a Phase 2b clinical study for treatment of NTM with omadacycline are underway, with the initiation of patient enrollment planned for as early as the first half of 2021. This study is a placebo-controlled, randomized monotherapy study of NTM in patients who are not receiving other treatments. Study size will be approximately 75 subjects randomized in a 1.5 to 1 ratio. Therapy will last for 12 weeks with an efficacy endpoint assessment at that timepoint. Due to the small numbers of patients with this rare disease, we expect this study will complete enrollment within approximately two years from commencement.\nOn February 25, 2019, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Paratek Royalty Corporation, entered into the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth therein, we borrowed a $32.5 million loan, which was secured by, and will be repaid based upon, royalties from the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. On May 1, 2019, we received $27.8 million, net of $0.5 million lender discount, $0.2 million in lender expenses incurred, and $4.0 million that was deposited into an interest reserve account. We also paid $1.2 million in other lender fees related to the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nWe lease our Boston, Massachusetts and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania office spaces under non-cancelable operating leases expiring in August 2021 and 2024, respectively.\nUnder the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance will bear interest at an annual rate of 7.0%, increasing to an annual rate of 10% during the continuance of any event of default. Payments of the obligations outstanding under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement will be made quarterly, beginning with the payment due in respect of the quarter ending March 31, 2021, out of the Royalty Interest payments and Revenue Interest payments received by the Subsidiary during such quarter, or the Collection Amount. On each payment date, after payment of certain expenses, the Collection Amount shall be applied first to accrued interest, with any excess up to $15.0 million per annum applied to repay principal until the balance is fully repaid, and any shortfalls being capitalized and added to the principal balance of the loan. Amounts in excess of the $15.0 million annual cap shall be shared between us and R-Bridge Healthcare Investment Advisory, Ltd., or the R-Bridge Lender, based on a formula set out in the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. Following repayment in full of the loan, the first $15.0 million per annum in Collection Amount shall be paid to us and any amounts in excess shall be shared between us and the R-Bridge Lender based on a formula set out in the R-Bridge Loan Agreement.\n \u2022 service and pay down our debt. \nRevenue Earned Under Government Contracts\nIn June 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13. The FASB subsequently issued amendments to ASU 2016-13, which have the same effective date and transition date of January 1, 2023. These standards require that credit losses be reported using an expected losses model rather than the incurred losses model that is currently used, and establishes additional disclosures related to credit risks. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, these standards now require allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. These standards limit the amount of credit losses to be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value and requires the reversal of previously recognized credit losses if fair value increases. Based on the composition of our investment portfolio, accounts receivable and other financial assets, current market conditions and historical credit loss activity, we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss and related disclosures.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 represents interest incurred on the Notes of $8.7 million, the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement of $6.8 million, and the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement of $2.7 million, partially offset by the net accretion of our marketable securities of $1.8 million. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities of $3.6 million.\nTogether with BARDA, we continue to make progress advancing our efforts to onshore the manufacturing of NUZYRA to the U.S. We have completed the knowledge transfer of our manufacturing process for the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of omadacycline to our U.S. onshoring partners and are currently in the development stage of the initiative. The process flow, equipment selection and facility modifications have been planned and process development and engineering are expected to be completed in 2021. The manufacturing process validation will begin in early 2022, with the goal of commercial supply production in the U.S. by 2023.\nUnder the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance will bear interest at an annual rate of 12.0%. Payments of interest under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement are made quarterly out of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement royalty payments received since the immediately preceding payment date. On each interest payment date, any royalty payments in excess of accrued interest on the loan will be used to repay the principal of the loan until the balance is fully repaid. In addition, the Subsidiary made up-front payments to HCRP of (i) a 1.5% fee and (ii) up to $300,000 for HCRP's expenses. The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement matures on May 1, 2029, at which time, if not earlier repaid in full, the outstanding principal amount of the loan, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, and all other obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable in cash. We entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement in favor of HCRP, pursuant to which the Subsidiary's obligations under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of all of our holdings of the Subsidiary's capital stock.\n \u2022 $30.6 million in net proceeds received from the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement; and \nOn December 31, 2020, or the Closing Date, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary PRTK SPV2 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or the Subsidiary, entered into a royalty and revenue interest-backed loan agreement with an affiliate of R-Bridge Healthcare Investment Advisory, Ltd., herein referred to as the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, the Subsidiary borrowed a $60.0 million term loan, secured by, and repaid with proceeds from, (i) royalties from our license agreement with Zai Labs (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or the Zai Collaboration Agreement, and such royalties, or the Royalty Interest, and (ii) a revenue interest based on our U.S. sales of NUZYRA in an initial amount of two and a half percent (2.5%), which amount may adjust under certain circumstances up to five percent (5%), of our net U.S. sales, subject to an annual cap of $10.0 million, which may adjust under certain circumstances to $12.0 million, or the Revenue Interest.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement contains customary defined events of default, upon which any outstanding principal and unpaid interest shall be immediately due and payable. These include: failure to pay any principal or interest when due\u037e any uncured breach of a representation, warranty or covenant\u037e any uncured failure to perform or observe covenants\u037e any uncured cross default under a material contract\u037e any uncured breach of our representations, warranties or covenants under its Contribution and Servicing Agreement with the Subsidiary\u037e any termination of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement\u037e and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events.\nConvertible Senior Subordinated Notes\nInvesting Activities\nWe anticipate an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in support of our expansion into the community setting and other commercial activities, as well as the continued costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include costs related to the NUZYRA community expansion, travel, in-person\nNet product revenue recognized on sales of NUZYRA in the U.S. was $38.8 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in net product revenue is primarily the result of an increase in sales volume due to higher customer demand.\nTable 421: <table> <tr> <td>\nIn December 2019, we entered into a five-year contract with an option to extend to ten years with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, herein referred to as the BARDA contract. The BARDA contract supports the development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, FDA post-marketing requirements, or PMRs, associated with the initial NUZYRA approval, and an option for BARDA to procure up to 10,000 treatment courses of NUZYRA for the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, for use against potential biothreats. Under the terms of the BARDA contract, we have been awarded initial funding of approximately $59.4 million for the development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax and the purchase of an initial 2,500 treatment courses of NUZYRA to add to the current SNS. BARDA has also exercised two options that awarded additional funding including approximately $76.8 million for existing FDA PMRs that began in April 2020 and approximately $20.4 million for manufacturing-related requirements that also began in April 2020. Remaining option funding includes the potential for approximately $12.7 million to support the development of NUZYRA for the prophylaxis of anthrax and a maximum of approximately $115.3 million to provide for three additional purchases of NUZYRA for the SNS, each of which will be triggered at BARDA's discretion upon us demonstrating continued progress in the anthrax development program.\nWe executed an amended lease agreement on our Boston office space in July 2016. The amended lease agreement added 4,153 rentable square feet of office space and extended the original lease term by two years. In accordance with the amended lease agreement, we paid a security deposit of $0.1 million. Subsequent to the amended lease agreement, we record monthly lease expense of approximately $49,000 for the Boston office space.\n \u2022 Trade discounts and allowances \nBusiness Update Regarding COVID-19\n \u2022 the progress of clinical development of omadacycline in additional indications, including NTM and pulmonary anthrax; \nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.\n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with clinical research organizations, or CROs, and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials; \nThe amount of variable consideration is estimated by using either of the following methods, depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled:\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This standard modifies certain disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n \u2022 timing and amount of actual reimbursements and NUZYRA purchases under the BARDA contract; \nOur office-based employees have been working from home since early March 2020. We suspended in-person interactions by our customer-facing personnel in healthcare settings during the majority of the second quarter of 2020. During this period of suspended in-person interactions, we engaged with our customers remotely in an effort to continue to support and educate healthcare professionals. In late June 2020, our customer-facing personnel began re-engaging with our customers in a manner consistent with guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other state and local mandates. Our customer-facing personnel are now operating through a hybrid model of both virtual and in-person engagement.\nOur data generation and medical affairs activities have progressed with the initiation of ten non-clinical and clinical studies in investigator-initiated research, or IIR, programs, and the publication of 19 omadacycline manuscripts that address the use of NUZYRA in special pathogens, populations or disease states that will further define its unique therapeutic profile. In parallel, real-world evidence from two ongoing observational studies and independent case series continue to be published in peer reviewed journals that describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients with challenging infections, particularly in NTM and osteomyelitis, that receive omadacycline as a therapeutic agent.\nCost of Product Revenue\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe anticipate an increase in research and development expenses in future periods as we continue development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, continue the work on our FDA PMRs, and continue the onshoring of our manufacturing process, the majority of which is reimbursable under the BARDA contract. We will also incur additional spend as we continue exploring pathways for NTM indications.\n</td> </tr>\nResearch and Development Expense\nGovernment Contract Service Revenue\nContract costs\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $89.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $0.8 million increase is primarily the result of an increase in costs to outsource our contract sales organization, higher product distribution fees, and additional investigator-initiated research grants offset by lower marketing, market research and promotional program costs, personnel-related costs, and travel, entertainment, and other operating expenses.\nGovernment Contract Service Revenue\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2020 includes the following:\nHolders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date.\nWe recognize as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the costs are expected to be recovered. As a practical expedient, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. To date, we have not incurred any incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nResults of Operations\nRecent Accounting Standards\nWe charge costs of our research and development to expense as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of the costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation, facilities, research-related overhead, clinical trial costs, contracted services, manufacturing, license fees and other external costs. Research and development expenses also include gross reimbursable costs incurred through research and development services performed for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, services performed for U.S. manufacturing onshoring and security requirements, and services performed for FDA PMRs under the BARDA contract. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\n \u2022 Chargebacks and rebates \nProduct Returns - Generally, the Company's customers have the right to return any unopened/unused product supply during the 18-month period beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending 12 months after the labeled expiration date. Since the Company currently does not have history of NUZYRA returns, the Company estimated returns based on industry data for comparable products in the market. As the Company distributes its product and establishes historical sales over a longer period of time, the Company will be able to place more reliance on historical purchasing, demand and return patterns of its customers when evaluating its reserves for product returns.\nIn assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise(s), whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promise(s), whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise(s), and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise(s). For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nResearch and development expenses were $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $15.7 million decrease is primarily the result of lower personnel-related costs and lower clinical study costs associated with completion of our Phase 2 UTI program in 2019, partially offset by an increase in costs incurred under the BARDA contract and third-party manufacturing scale-up costs.\nThe Company sells its product principally to a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers in the U.S. These customers subsequently resell the Company's product to health care providers or dispense the product to patients. In addition to distribution agreements with customers, the Company enters into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of our product.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $125.2 million.\n \u2022 product revenue received from commercial sales of NUZYRA; \nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nWe could also enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, manufacturing, supplier and contractor agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and/or long-term commitments of cash.\nThe Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities.\nWe have initiated discussions with the FDA to explore potential regulatory registration paths to determine the efficacy and safety of omadacycline in patients afflicted with non-tuberculous mycobacteria abscessus, or NTM, which are environmental organisms that can be found in soil, dust, and water, including natural and municipal water sources. Infection occurs when a person is exposed to NTM organisms. NTM can form difficult-to-eliminate biofilms, which are collections of microorganisms that stick to each other, and adhere to surfaces in moist environments. Although severe infection can affect the lymph nodes, skin, soft tissues, bones, and joints, the vast majority of NTM infection cases are pulmonary. The diagnosis of NTM infection is often delayed due to non-specific symptoms and a lack of disease state awareness by clinicians. NTM is a rare and orphan disease with no FDA-approved therapies, which we estimate has a potential $1.0 billion addressable market in the U.S.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. Prior to the regulatory approval of our product candidates, we incurred expenses for the manufacture of drug product that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of our products. Until the first reporting period when regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered probable, we record all such costs as research and development expense. Inventory used in clinical trials is also expensed as research and development expense when selected for such use. We classify inventory costs as long-term when the we expect to utilize the inventory beyond its normal operating cycle. We perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period and writes down any excess and obsolete inventory to its net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded as a component of cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires the use of estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required.\nGovernment contract grant revenue earned under our BARDA contract was $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. No such government contract grant revenue was earned during the year ended December 31, 2019 as the BARDA contract was executed in December 2019.\nThe allocated consideration of government contract grant revenue is recognized when earned under our BARDA contract and represents the reimbursement by BARDA of costs incurred by us for FDA post-marketing requirements, or PMRs, associated with the approval of NUZYRA, including CABP and pediatric studies, as well as a five-year post-marketing bacterial surveillance study. Refer to Note 5, Government Contract Revenue in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the BARDA contract and related revenue recognition.\nThe Company recognizes sales of NUZYRA under its government contracts as product revenue when control of NUZYRA is transferred, in accordance with ASC 606. It also recognizes government contract service revenue and government contract grant revenue as defined below.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenditures and operating losses for the next several years as we:\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of $122.5 million in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, offset by $29.6 million of investments in marketable securities (U.S. treasury securities) and $0.4 million in purchases of fixed assets.\nLeases\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ntraining events and sales meetings, the hiring of additional personnel, executing marketing and promotional programs, and engaging consultants, legal and other professional fees, and other operating expenses.\n \u2022 contract manufacturing organizations with respect to clinical material supply and commercial product; \n \u2022 conduct additional clinical trials of omadacycline; \nIn addition, J. Wood Capital Advisors LLC, our financial advisor, purchased $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes in a separate, concurrent private placement on the same terms as other investors.\nWe enter into collaboration agreements for research, development, manufacturing and commercial services that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which it licenses certain rights to its product candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. The amount of variable consideration is constrained until it is probable that the revenue is not at a significant risk of reversal in a future period. The contracts into which we enter generally do not include significant financing components.\nIn July 2019, we entered into an At the Market Sales Agreement, or the 2019 Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, and BTIG, LLC, or BTIG, under which we were permitted to offer and sell our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $50.0 million from time to time through Jefferies and BTIG as our sales agents. Sales of our common stock through Jefferies and BTIG were to be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including without limitation sales made directly on the Nasdaq Global Market or any other existing trading market for its common stock. Jefferies and BTIG, as applicable, were entitled to a commission of 3% of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through Jefferies and BTIG under the 2019 Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 5,176,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2019 Sales Agreement for $21.9 million in proceeds, after deducting commissions of $0.7 million, which fully utilized the 2019 Sales Agreement. Upon completion of the final sale of our shares of common stock available for sale under the 2019 Sales Agreement, that agreement was terminated.\nThe net proceeds of the term loan were used by the Subsidiary to purchase from the Company the Royalty Interest and Revenue Interest, pursuant to the terms of the Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement and the Contribution and Servicing Agreement, respectively. We raised approximately $58.3 million in net proceeds in connection with the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, comprised of the $60.0 million term loan funded at execution, net of $1.1 million in lender fees accounted for as debt discount and $0.6 million in direct and incremental third-party expenses accounted for as debt issuance costs. The net proceeds of the term loan, together with cash on hand, was used to prepay in full all obligations outstanding under the loan arrangement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of compensation costs associated with our contract sales force, commercial support personnel, and medical affairs professionals, as well as personnel in executive and other administrative functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, trade, and other commercial costs and distribution fees necessary to support the launch of NUZYRA and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services.\n \u2022 the scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, preclinical development and clinical trials; \nResearch and Development Expenses\nCost of product revenue consists primarily of the manufacturing costs for NUZYRA and royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA. All manufacturing costs incurred prior to NUZYRA's approval in the U.S. on October 2, 2018 were expensed in research and development and were not included in cost of revenue.\n b) The most likely amount\u201d is the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (i.e., the single most likely outcome of the contract). Under ASC 606, the most likely amount may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the contract has only two possible outcomes (i.e., either achieve or do not achieve a threshold specified in a contract). \nGovernment contract service revenue is recognized as services are performed. Revenue and related reimbursable expenses are presented on a gross basis in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The related reimbursable expenses are expensed as incurred as research and development expense.\n \u2022 our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights; \nThe Notes were issued by us on April 23, 2018, pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of such date, or the Indenture, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, or the Trustee. The Notes bear cash interest at the annual rate of 4.75%, payable on November 1 and May 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018, and mature on May 1, 2024 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. We will settle conversions of the Notes through delivery of shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 62.8931 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment as provided for in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $15.90 per share, representing a conversion premium of approximately 20% above the closing price of the common stock of $13.25 per share on April 18, 2018.\nwith any accrued and unpaid interest, and all other obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable in cash by the Subsidiary.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception in 1996. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2020 was $807.8 million and our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $96.5 million. A substantial amount of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. The net losses and negative operating cash flows incurred to date, together with expected future losses, have had, and likely will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders' deficit and working capital. The amount of future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate offsetting revenue. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years.\n \u2022 $0.5 million in net proceeds raised through the 2018 ESPP; \nChargebacks - Although the Company primarily sells products to specialty distributors in the U.S., the Company also enters into agreements with hospitals and outpatient infusion centers, either directly or through group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their members, in connection with the purchase of product. Based on these agreements, some of the Company's customers have the right to receive a discounted price on product purchases. In the case of discounted pricing, the Company typically provides a credit to its specialty distributors customer (i.e., chargeback), representing the difference between the customer's acquisition list price and the discounted price.\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical trials and other research and development activities; \nTrade Discounts and Allowances - The Company generally provides customers with discounts that are explicitly stated in the Company's contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, the Company receives sales order management, data and distribution services from certain customers. To the extent the services received are distinct from the Company's sale of products to the customer, these payments are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss of the Company.\nGovernment Contract Grant Revenue\nIn determining the amounts of certain allowances and accruals, the Company must make significant judgments and estimates. For example, in determining these amounts, the Company estimates prescription demand from the specialty pharmacies, hospital demand, buying patterns by hospitals, hospital systems and/or group purchasing organizations and the levels of inventory held by specialty distributors and customers. Making these determinations involves analyzing third-party industry data to determine whether trends in historical channel distribution patterns will predict future product sales. The Company receives data periodically from its specialty distributors and customers on inventory levels and historical channel sales mix, and the Company considers this data when determining the amount of the allowances and accruals for variable consideration.", "item_7_text": "As of December 31, 2020, we had recorded long-term debt obligations of $250.5 million, net of debt discount and issuance costs of $7.0 million. Debt issuance costs are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than capitalized as an asset in accordance with ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\nInterest expense represents interest incurred on the Notes (as defined below), the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement, and the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement (as defined below) as well as the adjustment of our marketable securities to amortized cost.\nGovernment Contract Grant Revenue\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company adjusts its allowances for cash discounts, product returns, chargebacks, and other rebates and discounts when the Company believes actual experience may differ from current estimates.\nThe R-Bridge Loan Agreement contains customary defined events of default, upon which any outstanding principal, unpaid interest and other obligations of the Subsidiary, shall be immediately due and payable by the Subsidiary. These include: failure to pay any principal or interest when due\u037e failure to the Capped Amount as and when due following a non-qualified change of control, any uncured breach of a representation, warranty or covenant\u037e any uncured failure to perform or observe covenants\u037e any uncured breach of our representations, warranties or covenants under an ancillary agreement executed by the us and the Subsidiary in respect of the Royalty Interest\u037e any termination of the Zai Collaboration Agreement\u037e and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events. No events of default had occurred under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement through December 31, 2020.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $134.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net cash used in operating activities primarily consists of our net losses adjusted for non-cash items and changes in components of operating assets and liabilities as follows:\n \u2022 $58.7 million in net proceeds received from the R-Bridge Loan Agreement; offset by \n \u2022 potential changes in government regulation; and \nWe also continue to pursue a number of other opportunities for NUZYRA. The first of these is the filing with the FDA of a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, for the oral-only loading dose regimen for patients diagnosed with CABP. The sNDA includes the results of a study designed with agreement from the FDA to show that an oral-only loading dose regimen will have a comparable pharmacokinetic profile to the approved IV loading dose regimen in patients with CABP that was established in the Phase 3 registration study. Enrollment in this study was stopped early in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions at the clinical centers. Data obtained from the study was reviewed and determined to support the submission of the sNDA in July 2020. We believe consideration for this oral-only loading dose regimen is expected during the second quarter of 2021.\n \u2022 our need and ability to hire additional management, scientific, commercial, operations and medical personnel; \nIf an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent or include a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised.\n \u2022 allocated facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies; and \nUnder a license agreement with Tufts University, or Tufts, we were required to make aggregate regulatory milestone payments of up to $300,000 associated with the first Phase 3 clinical trials, filing of an NDA, and approval of its first product candidate, all of which have been paid. We are also obligated to pay Tufts a minimum royalty payment in the amount of $25,000 per year. We also agreed to pay Tufts royalties based on gross sales of products, as defined in the agreement, ranging in the low single digits depending on the applicable field of use for such product sale. Also, if we enter into a sublicense under the agreement, based on the applicable field of use for such product, we agreed to pay Tufts a percentage, ranging from 10% to 14 % for compounds other than omadacycline, and a percentage in the single digits for the compound omadacycline, of that portion of any sublicense issue fees or maintenance fees received by us that are reasonably attributable to the sublicense of the rights granted to us under the Tufts License Agreement and the lesser of a percentage, ranging from the low tens to the high twenties based on the applicable field of use for such product, of the royalty payments made to us by the sublicensee or the amount of royalty payments that would have been paid by us to Tufts if we had sold the products.\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2019, a net loss of $128.8 million was adjusted for non-cash items including $14.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and $3.5 million of non-cash interest expense, offset by $1.3 million in net depreciation, amortization and accretion, and a net decrease of $21.7 million due to changes in operating assets and liability. The significant items in the change in operations assets and liabilities include an increase in accounts receivable, other receivables, prepaid, and other current assets of $11.5 million and an increase in inventories of $10.9 million. \nIn assessing whether a constraint is necessary, the Company considers both the likelihood and the magnitude of the revenue reversal. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company's estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the Company's estimates, the Company adjusts these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. The specific considerations the Company uses in estimating these amounts related to variable consideration associated with the Company's products are as follows:\nWe executed an amended lease agreement on our King of Prussia office space in October 2016. The amended lease agreement is for 19,708 rentable square feet of office space and we took control of such office space during the first quarter of 2017. The total lease commitment is over a seven-year and seven-month lease term. The amended lease agreement contains rent escalation and a partial rent abatement period, which is accounted for as rent expense under the straight-line method. We are required to make additional payments under the facility operating leases for taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period.\nItem 7.\nWe have used and we intend to continue to use the net proceeds from the above offerings of our common stock and the Notes, as well as other current and retired long-term debt agreements, together with our existing capital resources and future NUZYRA product sales, government contract revenue and royalty revenue, to fund our\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product and royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through a combination of public or private equity\nOur third-party contract manufacturing partners continue to operate their manufacturing facilities at or near normal levels. While we currently do not anticipate any interruptions in our supply chain, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our and/or our third-party suppliers' and contract manufacturing partners' ability to manufacture our products or the products of our partners. The COVID-19 pandemic has prevented technical service, quality assurance and supply operations personnel from traveling to our third-party contract manufacturing partners in Europe.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, or ASU 2017-04. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 eliminate the current two-step approach used to test goodwill for impairment and require an entity to apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 (upon the first goodwill impairment test performed during that fiscal year). Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. A reporting entity must apply the amendments in ASU 2017-04 using a prospective approach. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nCost of product revenue was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $5.2 million increase is primarily the result of an increase in NUZYRA product sales, NUZYRA sample program shipments, royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA, and certain period costs. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, certain of the costs of NUZYRA units recognized as revenue during years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were expensed prior to FDA approval in October 2018, and therefore are not included in cost of product revenue during the periods. We expect cost of product revenue to increase in absolute dollars as product revenue increases.\nCost of product revenue represents the cost of the product itself, labor and overhead, and any reserve for excess or obsolete inventory, as well as stability studies, inventory scrap and royalty expense. Cost of product revenue also represents royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA.\n \u2022 future clinical trial results; \nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents interest incurred on the Notes of $8.8 million, the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement of $7.3 million, the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement of $4.0 million and interest expense related to our money market funds and marketable securities of $0.1 million. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities of $1.5 million.\n \u2022 legal and other professional service providers. \n \u2022 $70.0 million in principal debt payments under the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement. \nWe have entered into multiple commercial supply agreements. Please refer to Item 1, Business, for further details on our agreements.\nPrior to the eighth (8th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the R-Bridge Loan Agreement will automatically terminate once the Subsidiary has paid to the R-Bridge Lender, in the form of regularly scheduled payments or as a voluntary prepayment, a capped amount of $114 million, less principal, interest and certain fee payments through the date of such prepayment, or the Capped Amount. After the eighth (8th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Revenue Interest can be terminated but the Royalty Interest payments shall continue until maturity of the R-Bridge Loan Agreement on December 31, 2032, at which time, the outstanding principal amount of the loan, if any, together\nWe began generating revenue from product sales when we launched NUZYRA in the U.S. in February 2019 and from royalties on net sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. when Almirall launched the product in January 2019. Our future funding requirements will depend on our ability to generate continued revenue from sales of NUZYRA, and our partner, Almirall's, ability to generate continued revenue from sales of SEYSARA, with respect to which we are entitled to tiered royalties in the U.S. and flat royalties in the greater China region. We do not expect to generate any other revenue unless and until our omadacycline greater China region partner, Zai, and our SEYSARA greater China region partner, Almirall, obtains regulatory approval of and commercializes its respective product in the greater China region. Zai submitted the first regulatory approval application for a licensed product in the People's Republic of China in December 2019, which was accepted by the China NMPA in February 2020 and, in April 2020, the NMPA granted priority review status for its application. We will require substantial additional funding to meet FDA PMRs for NUZYRA, which we expect to continue to be funded through the BARDA contract. Additional resources will also be needed to support and accelerate the commercialization of NUZYRA, fund the development of omadacycline in other indications, including NTM and pulmonary anthrax, and to advance the development of potential other product candidates, and such funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all. BARDA's procurement of NUZYRA for the SNS will also be an important component to satisfying future funding requirements. While it is difficult to predict with certainty, on February 24, 2021, we announced that the initial NUZYRA procurement for the SNS under our contract with BARDA was expected to occur in the first half of 2021 and another procurement in the second half of 2021. The initial procurement is contingent upon receipt of comments from the FDA on the pre-emergency use authorization, or pre-EUA, submitted in February 2020. As part of the ongoing review, supplemental mouse pharmacokinetic data requested by the FDA was submitted in November 2020. On March 2, 2021, we received feedback from the FDA with a recommendation to consider an additional in vitro model to further characterize the optimal pharmacokinetic parameters for pulmonary anthrax as part of the development program. We are in discussions with BARDA to align on the best approach to integrating the FDA recommendation into the development program. BARDA is working with FDA to satisfy BARDA's requirement that the status of the current pre-EUA will enable them to initiate the first procurement into the SNS. Once the initial procurement is completed, the timing of future procurements is not expected to be impacted.\nThe Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants, including those relating to: use of proceeds\u037e maintenance of books and records\u037e financial reporting and notification\u037e compliance with laws\u037e and protection of our intellectual property. The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement also contains certain customary negative covenants, barring the Subsidiary from: certain fundamental transactions\u037e issuing dividends and distributions\u037e incurring additional indebtedness outside of the ordinary course of business\u037e engaging in any business activity other than related to the Almirall Collaboration Agreement\u037e and permitting any additional liens on the collateral provided to HCRP under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nResearch and development expenses consisted primarily of costs directly incurred by us for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nCommercial Payer and Other Rebates - The Company plans to continue to contract with certain private payer organizations, primarily insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of NUZYRA and contracted formulary status. The Company estimates these rebates and records reserves for such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized. Currently, the reserve for customer payer rebates considers future utilization based on third-party studies of payer prescription data; the utilization is applied to product that remains in the distribution and retail pharmacy channel inventories at the end of each reporting period. As the Company distributes its product and establishes historical sales over a longer period of time (i.e., two years), the Company will be able to place more reliance on historical data related to commercial payer rebates (i.e., actual utilization units) while continuing to rely on third-party data related to payer prescriptions and utilization.\n \u2022 costs required to ensure that our and our partners' business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations; \nFinancial Operations Overview\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist stockholders and investors reading the consolidated financial statements in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nProduct Revenue, Net\n \u2022 the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals. \nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of us or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nCollaboration and royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of $1.3 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. by Almirall under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), and $0.2 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of XERAVA in the U.S. by Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. under the Tetraphase License Agreement (as defined below). Fourth quarter royalty revenue recognized for sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. was estimated using third-party data and an approximation of discounts and allowances to calculate net product sales, to which the Company then applied the applicable royalty percentage specified in the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted in the period in which they become known, which is expected to be the following quarter.\n \u2022 direct employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense of our research and development personnel; \nData generation will continue to expand throughout 2021 with additional evidence from our IIR programs in areas such as diabetic foot and C. difficile infections. In addition, non-clinical research studying the activity of omadacycline alone and in combination in an osteomyelitis model in rats and studies in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium avium complex, or MAC, will build on the growing library of scientific data for NUZYRA.\n \u2022 the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy generally and on our business and operations specifically, including our sales of NUZYRA, sales by our collaboration partners with respect to which we are entitled to royalties, our third-party manufacturers and supply chain, our research and development efforts, our clinical trials and our employees. \n \u2022 royalty revenue received from commercial sales of SEYSARA by Almirall; \nResearch and Development Expense\n \u2022 the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical study materials and developing manufacturing processes; \nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our products or product candidates for which we or any partner obtain regulatory approval, such as NUZYRA and SEYSARA. Aside from the FDA approval of NUZYRA and SEYSARA in the U.S., we or our partners may never succeed in achieving other regulatory approvals for NUZYRA, or any of our other product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\nAfter deducting costs incurred of $6.0 million, we raised net proceeds from the issuance of long-term convertible debt of $159.0 million in April 2018. All costs were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the Notes at an effective interest rate of 5.47% and recorded as additional interest expense.\n</table>\nInventory\nIn February 2020, we entered into an ex-U.S. license agreement with Almirall, the Ex-U.S. License, under which Almirall granted to us an exclusive license in and to certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates in order to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize sarecycline in all countries other than the U.S. In connection with the Ex-U.S. License, we pay Almirall, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis (i) for eight (8) years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country, a royalty in the middle-single digits on our or our affiliates' nets sales of sarecycline products outside of the U.S. (other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), the development and commercialization rights to which for sarecycline in connection with the treatment of acne we exclusively licensed to Almirall), subject to certain standard reductions, and (ii) for fifteen years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country, a percentage of the consideration (e.g., milestones, royalties) we receive from third-party sublicensees in connection with developing and commercializing sarecycline outside of the U.S., which ranges from one-half of such consideration for sarecycline products for the treatment of acne to one-fifth of such consideration for sarecycline products for the treatment of other indications, in each case subject to a 50% reduction for any sarecycline product not in a solid oral tablet formulation for which Paratek or its affiliates have incurred significant development costs and (ii) for eight years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country, a royalty in the middle-single digits on our or our affiliates' net sales of sarecycline products outside of the U.S., subject to certain standard reductions.\n \u2022 $21.9 million in net proceeds raised through the sale of shares of our common stock through the 2019 Sales Agreement; and \nLicenses of intellectual property\nongoing company operations, including clinical studies of omadacycline, NUZYRA commercial operations, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 16, Long-Term Debt, for further details on our loan agreements, which include the Notes, the R-Bridge Loan Agreement and the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nGovernment Rebates -The Company is subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. The Company estimates our Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payer mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related product revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability that is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. For Medicare, the Company also estimates the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom it will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. The Company's liability for these rebates consists of an estimate of claims for the current quarter and estimated future claims that will be made for product sales that have been recognized as revenue but remain in distribution channel inventory at period end.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2019 includes the following:\nTo date, we and our partners have been able to continue to supply our products to our patients worldwide and currently do not anticipate any interruptions in supply for the foreseeable future. Regarding our clinical programs, enrollment in our study designed to show that an oral-only loading dose regimen will have a comparable pharmacokinetic profile to the approved IV loading dose regimen in patients with CABP that was established in the Phase 3 registration study was stopped early in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions at the clinical centers. We continue to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, including our sales, expenses, supply chain and other clinical studies.\nThe following table summarizes our cash provided by and (used in) operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\nTo date, we have devoted a substantial amount of our resources to research and development efforts, including conducting clinical trials for omadacycline, protecting our intellectual property and providing selling, general and administrative support for these operations. We have historically financed our operations primarily through sales of our common stock, debt financings, strategic collaborations, and grant funding. We began generating revenue from product sales in February 2019.\n\nCustomer options\nOn February 24, 2021, we announced that the initial NUZYRA procurement for the SNS under our contract with BARDA was expected to occur in the first half of 2021 and another procurement in the second half of 2021. The initial procurement is contingent upon receipt of comments from the FDA on the pre-emergency use authorization, or pre-EUA, submitted in February 2020.

We are in discussions with BARDA to align on the best approach to integrating the FDA recommendation into the development program. BARDA is working with FDA to satisfy BARDA's requirement that the status of the current pre-EUA will enable them to initiate the first procurement into the SNS. Once the initial procurement is completed, the timing of future procurements is not expected to be impacted.\n \u2022 the costs associated with manufacturing and maintaining high quality sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; \nOn December 31, 2020, we used the proceeds from the sale of the Royalty Interest and Revenue Interest from the R-Bridge Loan Agreement (as defined below), together with cash on hand, to prepay in full all obligations outstanding under the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement. Repayment of all amounts outstanding under the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement qualified as an extinguishment of debt on the date the payment was made in satisfaction of all amounts due and we were unconditionally relieved of our obligations therein. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million was calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt, which includes any unamortized debt discount and issuance costs.\nCost of Product Revenue\n \u2022 CROs, in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 Product returns \nIf the Company concludes that some or all aspects of its government contracts represent a transaction with a customer to obtain services or goods that are an output of its ordinary activities in exchange for consideration, it accounts for those aspects of the arrangement in accordance with ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. Arrangements that are entirely in the scope of other guidance are accounted for under that guidance.\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel life-saving therapies for life-threatening diseases or other public health threats for civilian, government and military use. Our United States, or U.S., Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved commercial product, NUZYRA\u00ae (omadacycline) is a once-daily oral and intravenous antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP, and acute skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI, caused by susceptible pathogens. SEYSARA\u00ae (sarecycline) is an FDA-approved product with respect to which we have exclusively licensed in the U.S. and the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Macau, or the greater China region, certain rights to Almirall, LLC, or Almirall. SEYSARA is currently being marketed by Almirall in the U.S. as a once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. With respect to our technology as it relates to sarecycline, we retain development and commercialization rights in all countries other than the U.S. and the greater China region, and in February 2020, we exclusively licensed from Almirall certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates that is necessary or useful to develop or commercialize sarecycline outside of the U.S. Almirall plans to develop sarecycline for acne in China, with a submission to the China National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, expected in 2023.\nAt the end of each reporting period for any of our products, the Company may decide to constrain revenue for product returns based on information from various sources, including channel inventory levels and dating and sell-through data, the expiration dates of product currently being shipped, price changes of competitive products and introductions of generic products.\nOn April 18, 2018, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with the Initial Purchasers for whom Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Leerink Partners LLC acted as representatives, relating to the sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers. We also granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on April 20, 2018.\nProduct revenue, net, is recognized when earned on sales of NUZYRA, which was approved by the FDA in October 2018 and launched in the U.S. in February 2019. NUZYRA is sold principally to a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers in the U.S. These customers subsequently resell our product to health care providers or dispense the product to patients. In addition to distribution agreements with customers, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of our product. Product revenue is recognized net of reserves for all variable consideration, including rebates, chargebacks, discounts and product returns.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to May 6, 2021. We may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes, at its option, on or after May 6, 2021 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n \u2022 add personnel to support the business as we expand our commercial footprint and commercial footprint; \n \u2022 the economic and other terms, timing and success of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future, including the timing of receipt of any milestone or royalty payments under such arrangements; and \n \u2022 continue to augment our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize NUZYRA and increase our manufacturing capacity and capabilities to satisfy demand; \nLoss on extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement, which included any unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, recognized upon termination.\n \u2022 Commercial payer and other rebates \n \u2022 the costs and timing of commercialization activities for NUZYRA; \nCompany Overview\n a) The expected value\u201d is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. Under ASC 606, an expected value may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the Company has many contracts with similar characteristics. \nOur subsidiary, PRTK SPV1 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and owner of the Subsidiary's capital stock, has entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement in favor of the R-Bridge Lender, pursuant to which the Subsidiary's obligations under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement are secured by PRTK SPV1 LLC's pledge of all of the Subsidiary's capital stock.\nBased upon our current operating plan, we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $125.2 million as of December 31, 2020, will extend our cash runway through the end of 2023 with a pathway to cash flow break even.\nIn certain circumstances if, at any time during the six-month period beginning on, and including, the date that is six months after the last date of original issuance of the Notes, we fail to timely file certain documents or reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Notes are not otherwise freely tradable by holders of the Notes other than our affiliates or holders that were our affiliates at any time during the three months immediately preceding, additional interest will accrue on the Notes during the first 90-day period in which its failure to file has occurred and is continuing or such Notes are not otherwise freely tradable by holders other than the our affiliates (or holders that were our affiliates at any time during the three months immediately preceding).\nofferings, debt or other structured financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. We do not have any committed external sources of funds other than the rights under the BARDA contract and the rights to contingent milestone payments and/or royalties under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, the Almirall China License, the Tetraphase License Agreement and the Zai Collaboration Agreement, which are terminable by Almirall, Tetraphase and Zai, respectively, upon prior written notice. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect stockholders' rights. Future debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Additionally, future equity or debt financing may be difficult to obtain on favorable terms, if at all, in light of increased volatility within the global financial markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, NUZYRA, sarecycline, future revenue streams, research programs, product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market NUZYRA, sarecycline or our other product candidates that we may otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nThe method selected is applied consistently throughout the contract when estimating the effect of an uncertainty on an amount of variable consideration. In addition, the Company considers all the information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company and shall identify a reasonable number of possible consideration amounts. The relevant factors used in this determination include, but are not limited to, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns.\n \u2022 our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems; \nWe have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our pharmaceutical products, especially given the constraints on in-person promotion of NUZYRA and reduced access to prescribers due to restrictions in access to hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the unknown extent to which we will maintain existing or enter into new collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our product and product candidates, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures that we will require to fund our continuing operations, including for our clinical development programs and commercialization efforts for NUZYRA. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nRoyalties\n \u2022 seek regulatory approvals for additional indications for omadacycline, such as omadacycline for the treatment of NTM and pulmonary anthrax; \n \u2022 costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory compliance. \nWe entered into the original King of Prussia and Boston leases in January 2015 and April 2015, respectively. The lease terms under the original agreements were for six and four years, respectively. Each agreement had one renewal option for an extended term. The King of Prussia and Boston lease terms under the original agreements began in June 2015 and July 2015, respectively.\nWe base our expenses on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contractual arrangements with CROs, professional service firms and other vendors. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\n \u2022 Voluntary patient assistance programs \nInterest Expense\nAn ancillary agreement executed by us and the Subsidiary in respect of the Revenue Interest, contains negative covenants applicable to us, including restrictions on the sale or transfer of our assets related to NUZYRA and giving rise to the Revenue Interest, each subject to the exceptions set forth therein.\nR-Bridge Loan Agreement\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that therapeutic candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority, were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of the clinical development of product candidates, or if we experience significant delays in the enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nIn September 2009, we and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, which merged into Novartis Pharma AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis AG, entered into a Collaborative Development, Manufacture and Commercialization License Agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, which provided Novartis with a global, exclusive patent and technology license for the development, manufacturing and marketing of omadacycline. The Novartis Agreement was terminated by Novartis without cause in June 2011 and the termination was effective 60 days later. We and Novartis subsequently entered in a letter agreement in January 2012, or the Novartis Letter Agreement, as amended, pursuant to which we reconciled shared development costs and expenses and granted Novartis a right of first negotiation with respect to commercialization rights of omadacycline following approval of omadacycline from the FDA, EMA, or any regulatory agency, but only to the extent we had not previously granted such commercialization rights related to omadacycline to another third party as of any such approval. We also agreed to pay Novartis a 0.25% royalty, to be paid from net sales received in any country following the launch of omadacycline in that country and continuing until the later of the expiration of the last active valid patent claim covering such product in the country of sale and 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in such country. The first royalty payment became payable as of March 31, 2019. The amended Novartis Letter Agreement resulted in a long-term liability in the amount of $3.1 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, included within Other Long-Term Liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, short-term liabilities included within Other Current Liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 represent the portion of royalty payments due to Novartis within twelve months of each balance sheet date. There are no other payment obligations to Novartis under either the Novartis Agreement or the amended Novartis Letter Agreement.\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2020, a net loss of $96.5 million was adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense of $10.2 million, non-cash interest expense of $1.5 million, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 million, and a net decrease of $20.3 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The significant items in the change in operating assets and liabilities include an increase in accounts receivable, other receivables, prepaid, and other current assets of $7.5 million and an increase in inventories of $11.8 million. \nOn May 11, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, as amended on June 19, 2020 and declared effective on July 9, 2020, to sell certain of our securities in an aggregate amount of up to $250.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, $250.0 million remains available on this shelf registration statement.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to, among other items, accounts receivable and related reserves, inventory and related reserves, accrued sales allowances, net product revenue, government contract service revenue, government contract grant revenue, SEYSARA royalty revenue, leases, stock-based compensation arrangements, manufacturing and clinical accruals, useful lives for depreciation and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOther Income and Expenses\n \u2022 resources required to develop and implement policies and processes to promote ongoing compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations; \nGovernment contract service revenue is recognized when earned under our BARDA contract and represents the reimbursement by BARDA of costs incurred by us for work performed to develop NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax plus a small fixed administrative fee. Refer to Note 5, Government Contract Revenue in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the BARDA contract and related revenue recognition.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of $237.0 million in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, offset by $102.2 million of investments in marketable securities (U.S. treasury securities).\n \u2022 the ability of Zai to develop, manufacture and commercialize omadacycline in the Zai territory; \nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all the royalty has been allocated is satisfied (or partially satisfied).\n \u2022 $26.6 million in net proceeds raised through the sale of shares of our common stock through the 2019 Sales Agreement. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is continuing to affect our employees, health care institutions, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The COVID-19 related restrictions on in-person promotional access to health care institutions and the overall impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the health care and hospital environments could restrict the full potential of NUZYRA's growth. The length of time and full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.\nCollaboration and royalty revenue were $1.5 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nCollaboration and Royalty Revenue\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company's product, which typically occurs once the Company has transferred physical possession of the good to the customer. The transaction price that the Company recognizes as revenue reflects the amount it expects to be entitled to in connection with the sale and transfer of control of product to its customers. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. At the time that the Company's customers take control of the product, which is when the Company's performance obligation under the sales contracts is complete, the Company records product revenues net of applicable reserves for various types of variable consideration based on the Company's estimates of channel mix. The types of variable consideration in our product revenue are as follows:\n \u2022 the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we may pursue; \nLicenses\nIf we experience a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, prior to the maturity date of the Notes, holders of the Notes will, subject to specified conditions, have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the Notes and following a notice of redemption of the Notes, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such corporate event or redemption.\nAccrued Expenses\n \u2022 vendors in connection with preclinical development and operational activities; and \nThe allocated consideration of government contract grant revenue is recognized as the related reimbursable expenses are incurred. The cost reimbursements that are reported as revenue is presented gross of the related reimbursable expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The related reimbursable expenses are expensed as incurred as research and development expense.\nInterest Income\nPatient Assistance - The Company offers certain voluntary patient assistance programs for prescriptions, such as co-pay assistance programs, which are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payers. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that the Company expects to receive associated with product sale that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution and pharmacy channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.\nAs part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the transaction price under step (iii) above and (b) the timing of revenue recognition, including the appropriate measure of progress, in step (v) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties, should be included in the transaction price, as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, we generally allocate the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.\nFinancing Activities\nResearch and development expenses also include gross reimbursable costs incurred related to research and development services performed for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, services performed for U.S. manufacturing onshoring and security requirements, and services performed for FDA PMRs under the BARDA contract.\nGovernment Contract Service Revenue\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest income represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities.\nWe manage certain activities, such as clinical trial operations, manufacture of clinical trial material, and preclinical animal toxicology studies, through third-party contract organizations. The only costs we track by each product candidate are external costs such as services provided to us by CROs, manufacturing of preclinical and clinical drug product, and other outsourced research and development expenses. We do not assign or allocate to individual development programs internal costs such as salaries and benefits, facilities costs, lab supplies and the costs of preclinical research and studies. Our research and development expenses for omadacycline and other projects during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nGovernment contract service revenue earned under our BARDA contract was $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. No such government contract service revenue was earned during the year ended December 31, 2019 as the BARDA contract was executed in December 2019.\nOn February 25, 2019, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Paratek Royalty Corporation, or the Subsidiary, entered into a royalty-backed loan agreement, or the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P., or HCRP. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth therein, the Subsidiary borrowed a $32.5 million loan, which was secured by, and will be repaid based upon, royalties from the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. On May 1, 2019, we received $27.8 million, net of $0.5 million lender discount, $0.2 million in lender expenses incurred, and $4.0 million that was deposited into an interest reserve account. We also paid $1.2 million in other lender fees related to the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nWhile our BARDA contract is expected to significantly strengthen our cash position, unless we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our commercial products, we may need to raise additional capital in order to support and accelerate the commercialization of omadacycline and to advance the development of our other indications for omadacycline, such as NTM, or other product candidates. If we cannot generate a sufficient amount of product or royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt or other structured financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. We may be unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, which would force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our development programs or commercialization efforts. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never be able to do so.\nCost of Product Revenue\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed for us and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. Most of our service providers invoice us periodically in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and adjust if necessary. Examples of estimated expenses include fees paid to:\nIn the course of normal business operations, we also have agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing and other activities for operating purposes which are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days' prior written notice. These payments are not included in this table of contractual obligations.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nCollaboration and royalty revenue are recognized when revenue earned under our collaboration and license agreements. Refer to Note 6, License and Collaboration Agreements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the collaboration agreements and the related revenue recognition.\nRoyalty-Backed Loan Agreement\n \u2022 Government rebates \nWe have made significant progress in the pulmonary anthrax development program under the BARDA contract. A pharmacokinetic, or PK, study in rabbits was recently completed, which will lead into the pilot efficacy studies in this species. In addition, we have evaluated minimum inhibitory concentrations, or MICs, of omadacycline against approximately 100 anthrax strains. Omadacycline continued to demonstrate potent MICs and is considered effective against all bacteria tested. The collection of isolates had a strain resistant to doxycycline and a strain resistant to ciprofloxacin, the two antibiotics currently in the SNS after approval for the treatment of anthrax many years ago. Omadacycline activity was not impacted in either of those resistant strains.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains certain statements that are not strictly historical and are forward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to other risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements included in this section are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement, except as required by law.\nCollaboration and royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was comprised of a $3.0 million milestone payment earned under the Zai Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), upon submission of the first regulatory approval application for a licensed product in the People's Republic of China in December 2019, $1.9 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. by Almirall under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), and $0.1 million of royalty revenues earned on sales of XERAVA in the U.S. by Tetraphase under the Tetraphase License Agreement. Fourth quarter royalty revenue recognized for sales of SEYSARA in the U.S. was estimated using third party data and an approximation of discounts and allowances to calculate net product sales, to which we then applied the applicable royalty percentage specified in the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is expected to be the following quarter.\n \u2022 the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we may pursue; \nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGovernment Contract Grant Revenue\n \u2022 $0.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options; \nContract Service Providers\nThe R-Bridge Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants, including those relating to: use of proceeds\u037e maintenance of books and records\u037e financial reporting and notification\u037e compliance with laws\u037e and protection of Company intellectual property. The R-Bridge Loan Agreement also contains certain customary negative covenants, barring the Subsidiary from: certain fundamental transactions\u037e issuing dividends and distributions\u037e incurring additional indebtedness outside of the ordinary course of business\u037e engaging in any business activity other than related to the Zai Collaboration Agreement\u037e and permitting any additional liens on the collateral provided to the R-Bridge Lender under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement.\n \u2022 $0.6 million in net proceeds raised through the 2018 ESPP (as defined below); \nCollaboration and Royalty Revenue\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nProduct Revenue, Net\nAccounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied as services are rendered.\nCommercial Supply Agreements\nFor additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3.

In the case of an event of default with respect to the Notes arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other event of default with respect to the Notes under the Indenture occurs or is continuing, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of the Notes to be immediately due and payable.\n \u2022 build product inventory; and \n \u2022 the effect of competing products that may limit market penetration of our products; \nMilestone payments\nStart-up activities for a Phase 2b clinical study for treatment of NTM with omadacycline are underway, with the initiation of patient enrollment planned for as early as the first half of 2021. This study is a placebo-controlled, randomized monotherapy study of NTM in patients who are not receiving other treatments. Study size will be approximately 75 subjects randomized in a 1.5 to 1 ratio. Therapy will last for 12 weeks with an efficacy endpoint assessment at that timepoint. Due to the small numbers of patients with this rare disease, we expect this study will complete enrollment within approximately two years from commencement.\nOn February 25, 2019, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Paratek Royalty Corporation, entered into the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth therein, we borrowed a $32.5 million loan, which was secured by, and will be repaid based upon, royalties from the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. On May 1, 2019, we received $27.8 million, net of $0.5 million lender discount, $0.2 million in lender expenses incurred, and $4.0 million that was deposited into an interest reserve account. We also paid $1.2 million in other lender fees related to the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement.\nWe lease our Boston, Massachusetts and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania office spaces under non-cancelable operating leases expiring in August 2021 and 2024, respectively.\nUnder the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance will bear interest at an annual rate of 7.0%, increasing to an annual rate of 10% during the continuance of any event of default. Payments of the obligations outstanding under the R-Bridge Loan Agreement will be made quarterly, beginning with the payment due in respect of the quarter ending March 31, 2021, out of the Royalty Interest payments and Revenue Interest payments received by the Subsidiary during such quarter, or the Collection Amount. On each payment date, after payment of certain expenses, the Collection Amount shall be applied first to accrued interest, with any excess up to $15.0 million per annum applied to repay principal until the balance is fully repaid, and any shortfalls being capitalized and added to the principal balance of the loan. Amounts in excess of the $15.0 million annual cap shall be shared between us and R-Bridge Healthcare Investment Advisory, Ltd., or the R-Bridge Lender, based on a formula set out in the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. Following repayment in full of the loan, the first $15.0 million per annum in Collection Amount shall be paid to us and any amounts in excess shall be shared between us and the R-Bridge Lender based on a formula set out in the R-Bridge Loan Agreement.\n \u2022 service and pay down our debt. \nRevenue Earned Under Government Contracts\nIn June 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13. The FASB subsequently issued amendments to ASU 2016-13, which have the same effective date and transition date of January 1, 2023. These standards require that credit losses be reported using an expected losses model rather than the incurred losses model that is currently used, and establishes additional disclosures related to credit risks. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, these standards now require allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. These standards limit the amount of credit losses to be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value and requires the reversal of previously recognized credit losses if fair value increases. Based on the composition of our investment portfolio, accounts receivable and other financial assets, current market conditions and historical credit loss activity, we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss and related disclosures.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 represents interest incurred on the Notes of $8.7 million, the A&R Hercules Loan Agreement of $6.8 million, and the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement of $2.7 million, partially offset by the net accretion of our marketable securities of $1.8 million. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 represents interest earned on our money market funds and marketable securities of $3.6 million.\nTogether with BARDA, we continue to make progress advancing our efforts to onshore the manufacturing of NUZYRA to the U.S. We have completed the knowledge transfer of our manufacturing process for the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of omadacycline to our U.S. onshoring partners and are currently in the development stage of the initiative. The process flow, equipment selection and facility modifications have been planned and process development and engineering are expected to be completed in 2021. The manufacturing process validation will begin in early 2022, with the goal of commercial supply production in the U.S. by 2023.\nUnder the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance will bear interest at an annual rate of 12.0%. Payments of interest under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement are made quarterly out of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement royalty payments received since the immediately preceding payment date. On each interest payment date, any royalty payments in excess of accrued interest on the loan will be used to repay the principal of the loan until the balance is fully repaid. In addition, the Subsidiary made up-front payments to HCRP of (i) a 1.5% fee and (ii) up to $300,000 for HCRP's expenses. The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement matures on May 1, 2029, at which time, if not earlier repaid in full, the outstanding principal amount of the loan, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, and all other obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable in cash. We entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement in favor of HCRP, pursuant to which the Subsidiary's obligations under the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of all of our holdings of the Subsidiary's capital stock.\n \u2022 $30.6 million in net proceeds received from the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement; and \nOn December 31, 2020, or the Closing Date, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary PRTK SPV2 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or the Subsidiary, entered into a royalty and revenue interest-backed loan agreement with an affiliate of R-Bridge Healthcare Investment Advisory, Ltd., herein referred to as the R-Bridge Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, the Subsidiary borrowed a $60.0 million term loan, secured by, and repaid with proceeds from, (i) royalties from our license agreement with Zai Labs (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or the Zai Collaboration Agreement, and such royalties, or the Royalty Interest, and (ii) a revenue interest based on our U.S. sales of NUZYRA in an initial amount of two and a half percent (2.5%), which amount may adjust under certain circumstances up to five percent (5%), of our net U.S. sales, subject to an annual cap of $10.0 million, which may adjust under certain circumstances to $12.0 million, or the Revenue Interest.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement contains customary defined events of default, upon which any outstanding principal and unpaid interest shall be immediately due and payable. These include: failure to pay any principal or interest when due\u037e any uncured breach of a representation, warranty or covenant\u037e any uncured failure to perform or observe covenants\u037e any uncured cross default under a material contract\u037e any uncured breach of our representations, warranties or covenants under its Contribution and Servicing Agreement with the Subsidiary\u037e any termination of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement\u037e and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events.\nConvertible Senior Subordinated Notes\nInvesting Activities\nWe anticipate an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in support of our expansion into the community setting and other commercial activities, as well as the continued costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include costs related to the NUZYRA community expansion, travel, in-person\nNet product revenue recognized on sales of NUZYRA in the U.S. was $38.8 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in net product revenue is primarily the result of an increase in sales volume due to higher customer demand.\nTable 421: <table> <tr> <td>\nIn December 2019, we entered into a five-year contract with an option to extend to ten years with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, herein referred to as the BARDA contract. The BARDA contract supports the development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, FDA post-marketing requirements, or PMRs, associated with the initial NUZYRA approval, and an option for BARDA to procure up to 10,000 treatment courses of NUZYRA for the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, for use against potential biothreats. Under the terms of the BARDA contract, we have been awarded initial funding of approximately $59.4 million for the development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax and the purchase of an initial 2,500 treatment courses of NUZYRA to add to the current SNS. BARDA has also exercised two options that awarded additional funding including approximately $76.8 million for existing FDA PMRs that began in April 2020 and approximately $20.4 million for manufacturing-related requirements that also began in April 2020. Remaining option funding includes the potential for approximately $12.7 million to support the development of NUZYRA for the prophylaxis of anthrax and a maximum of approximately $115.3 million to provide for three additional purchases of NUZYRA for the SNS, each of which will be triggered at BARDA's discretion upon us demonstrating continued progress in the anthrax development program.\nWe executed an amended lease agreement on our Boston office space in July 2016. The amended lease agreement added 4,153 rentable square feet of office space and extended the original lease term by two years. In accordance with the amended lease agreement, we paid a security deposit of $0.1 million. Subsequent to the amended lease agreement, we record monthly lease expense of approximately $49,000 for the Boston office space.\n \u2022 Trade discounts and allowances \nBusiness Update Regarding COVID-19\n \u2022 the progress of clinical development of omadacycline in additional indications, including NTM and pulmonary anthrax; \nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective date.

This standard modifies certain disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n \u2022 timing and amount of actual reimbursements and NUZYRA purchases under the BARDA contract; \nOur office-based employees have been working from home since early March 2020. We suspended in-person interactions by our customer-facing personnel in healthcare settings during the majority of the second quarter of 2020. During this period of suspended in-person interactions, we engaged with our customers remotely in an effort to continue to support and educate healthcare professionals. In late June 2020, our customer-facing personnel began re-engaging with our customers in a manner consistent with guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other state and local mandates. Our customer-facing personnel are now operating through a hybrid model of both virtual and in-person engagement.\nOur data generation and medical affairs activities have progressed with the initiation of ten non-clinical and clinical studies in investigator-initiated research, or IIR, programs, and the publication of 19 omadacycline manuscripts that address the use of NUZYRA in special pathogens, populations or disease states that will further define its unique therapeutic profile. In parallel, real-world evidence from two ongoing observational studies and independent case series continue to be published in peer reviewed journals that describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients with challenging infections, particularly in NTM and osteomyelitis, that receive omadacycline as a therapeutic agent.\nCost of Product Revenue\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe anticipate an increase in research and development expenses in future periods as we continue development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, continue the work on our FDA PMRs, and continue the onshoring of our manufacturing process, the majority of which is reimbursable under the BARDA contract. We will also incur additional spend as we continue exploring pathways for NTM indications.\n</td> </tr>\nResearch and Development Expense\nGovernment Contract Service Revenue\nContract costs\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $89.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $0.8 million increase is primarily the result of an increase in costs to outsource our contract sales organization, higher product distribution fees, and additional investigator-initiated research grants offset by lower marketing, market research and promotional program costs, personnel-related costs, and travel, entertainment, and other operating expenses.\nGovernment Contract Service Revenue\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2020 includes the following:\nHolders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date.\nWe recognize as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the costs are expected to be recovered. As a practical expedient, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. To date, we have not incurred any incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nResults of Operations\nRecent Accounting Standards\nWe charge costs of our research and development to expense as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of the costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation, facilities, research-related overhead, clinical trial costs, contracted services, manufacturing, license fees and other external costs. Research and development expenses also include gross reimbursable costs incurred through research and development services performed for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, services performed for U.S. manufacturing onshoring and security requirements, and services performed for FDA PMRs under the BARDA contract. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\n \u2022 Chargebacks and rebates \nProduct Returns - Generally, the Company's customers have the right to return any unopened/unused product supply during the 18-month period beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending 12 months after the labeled expiration date. Since the Company currently does not have history of NUZYRA returns, the Company estimated returns based on industry data for comparable products in the market. As the Company distributes its product and establishes historical sales over a longer period of time, the Company will be able to place more reliance on historical purchasing, demand and return patterns of its customers when evaluating its reserves for product returns.\nIn assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise(s), whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promise(s), whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise(s), and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise(s). For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nResearch and development expenses were $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $15.7 million decrease is primarily the result of lower personnel-related costs and lower clinical study costs associated with completion of our Phase 2 UTI program in 2019, partially offset by an increase in costs incurred under the BARDA contract and third-party manufacturing scale-up costs.\nThe Company sells its product principally to a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers in the U.S. These customers subsequently resell the Company's product to health care providers or dispense the product to patients. In addition to distribution agreements with customers, the Company enters into arrangements with health care providers and payers that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of our product.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $125.2 million.\n \u2022 product revenue received from commercial sales of NUZYRA; \nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nWe could also enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, manufacturing, supplier and contractor agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and/or long-term commitments of cash.\nThe Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities.\nWe have initiated discussions with the FDA to explore potential regulatory registration paths to determine the efficacy and safety of omadacycline in patients afflicted with non-tuberculous mycobacteria abscessus, or NTM, which are environmental organisms that can be found in soil, dust, and water, including natural and municipal water sources. Infection occurs when a person is exposed to NTM organisms. NTM can form difficult-to-eliminate biofilms, which are collections of microorganisms that stick to each other, and adhere to surfaces in moist environments. Although severe infection can affect the lymph nodes, skin, soft tissues, bones, and joints, the vast majority of NTM infection cases are pulmonary. The diagnosis of NTM infection is often delayed due to non-specific symptoms and a lack of disease state awareness by clinicians. NTM is a rare and orphan disease with no FDA-approved therapies, which we estimate has a potential $1.0 billion addressable market in the U.S.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. Prior to the regulatory approval of our product candidates, we incurred expenses for the manufacture of drug product that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of our products. Until the first reporting period when regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered probable, we record all such costs as research and development expense. Inventory used in clinical trials is also expensed as research and development expense when selected for such use. We classify inventory costs as long-term when the we expect to utilize the inventory beyond its normal operating cycle. We perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period and writes down any excess and obsolete inventory to its net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded as a component of cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires the use of estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required.\nGovernment contract grant revenue earned under our BARDA contract was $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. No such government contract grant revenue was earned during the year ended December 31, 2019 as the BARDA contract was executed in December 2019.\nThe allocated consideration of government contract grant revenue is recognized when earned under our BARDA contract and represents the reimbursement by BARDA of costs incurred by us for FDA post-marketing requirements, or PMRs, associated with the approval of NUZYRA, including CABP and pediatric studies, as well as a five-year post-marketing bacterial surveillance study. Refer to Note 5, Government Contract Revenue in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the BARDA contract and related revenue recognition.\nThe Company recognizes sales of NUZYRA under its government contracts as product revenue when control of NUZYRA is transferred, in accordance with ASC 606. It also recognizes government contract service revenue and government contract grant revenue as defined below.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenditures and operating losses for the next several years as we:\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of $122.5 million in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, offset by $29.6 million of investments in marketable securities (U.S. treasury securities) and $0.4 million in purchases of fixed assets.\nLeases\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ntraining events and sales meetings, the hiring of additional personnel, executing marketing and promotional programs, and engaging consultants, legal and other professional fees, and other operating expenses.\n \u2022 contract manufacturing organizations with respect to clinical material supply and commercial product; \n \u2022 conduct additional clinical trials of omadacycline; \nIn addition, J. Wood Capital Advisors LLC, our financial advisor, purchased $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes in a separate, concurrent private placement on the same terms as other investors.\nWe enter into collaboration agreements for research, development, manufacturing and commercial services that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which it licenses certain rights to its product candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. The amount of variable consideration is constrained until it is probable that the revenue is not at a significant risk of reversal in a future period. The contracts into which we enter generally do not include significant financing components.\nIn July 2019, we entered into an At the Market Sales Agreement, or the 2019 Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, and BTIG, LLC, or BTIG, under which we were permitted to offer and sell our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $50.0 million from time to time through Jefferies and BTIG as our sales agents. Sales of our common stock through Jefferies and BTIG were to be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including without limitation sales made directly on the Nasdaq Global Market or any other existing trading market for its common stock. Jefferies and BTIG, as applicable, were entitled to a commission of 3% of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through Jefferies and BTIG under the 2019 Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 5,176,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2019 Sales Agreement for $21.9 million in proceeds, after deducting commissions of $0.7 million, which fully utilized the 2019 Sales Agreement. Upon completion of the final sale of our shares of common stock available for sale under the 2019 Sales Agreement, that agreement was terminated.\nThe net proceeds of the term loan were used by the Subsidiary to purchase from the Company the Royalty Interest and Revenue Interest, pursuant to the terms of the Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement and the Contribution and Servicing Agreement, respectively. We raised approximately $58.3 million in net proceeds in connection with the R-Bridge Loan Agreement, comprised of the $60.0 million term loan funded at execution, net of $1.1 million in lender fees accounted for as debt discount and $0.6 million in direct and incremental third-party expenses accounted for as debt issuance costs. The net proceeds of the term loan, together with cash on hand, was used to prepay in full all obligations outstanding under the loan arrangement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of compensation costs associated with our contract sales force, commercial support personnel, and medical affairs professionals, as well as personnel in executive and other administrative functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, trade, and other commercial costs and distribution fees necessary to support the launch of NUZYRA and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services.\n \u2022 the scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, preclinical development and clinical trials; \nResearch and Development Expenses\nCost of product revenue consists primarily of the manufacturing costs for NUZYRA and royalties owed on net sales of NUZYRA. All manufacturing costs incurred prior to NUZYRA's approval in the U.S. on October 2, 2018 were expensed in research and development and were not included in cost of revenue.\n b) The most likely amount\u201d is the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (i.e., the single most likely outcome of the contract). Under ASC 606, the most likely amount may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the contract has only two possible outcomes (i.e., either achieve or do not achieve a threshold specified in a contract). \nGovernment contract service revenue is recognized as services are performed. Revenue and related reimbursable expenses are presented on a gross basis in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The related reimbursable expenses are expensed as incurred as research and development expense.\n \u2022 our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights; \nThe Notes were issued by us on April 23, 2018, pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of such date, or the Indenture, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, or the Trustee. The Notes bear cash interest at the annual rate of 4.75%, payable on November 1 and May 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018, and mature on May 1, 2024 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. We will settle conversions of the Notes through delivery of shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 62.8931 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment as provided for in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $15.90 per share, representing a conversion premium of approximately 20% above the closing price of the common stock of $13.25 per share on April 18, 2018.\nwith any accrued and unpaid interest, and all other obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable in cash by the Subsidiary.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception in 1996. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2020 was $807.8 million and our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $96.5 million. A substantial amount of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. The net losses and negative operating cash flows incurred to date, together with expected future losses, have had, and likely will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders' deficit and working capital. The amount of future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate offsetting revenue. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years.\n \u2022 $0.5 million in net proceeds raised through the 2018 ESPP; \nChargebacks - Although the Company primarily sells products to specialty distributors in the U.S., the Company also enters into agreements with hospitals and outpatient infusion centers, either directly or through group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their members, in connection with the purchase of product. Based on these agreements, some of the Company's customers have the right to receive a discounted price on product purchases. In the case of discounted pricing, the Company typically provides a credit to its specialty distributors customer (i.e., chargeback), representing the difference between the customer's acquisition list price and the discounted price.\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical trials and other research and development activities; \nTrade Discounts and Allowances - The Company generally provides customers with discounts that are explicitly stated in the Company's contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, the Company receives sales order management, data and distribution services from certain customers. To the extent the services received are distinct from the Company's sale of products to the customer, these payments are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss of the Company.\nGovernment Contract Grant Revenue\nIn determining the amounts of certain allowances and accruals, the Company must make significant judgments and estimates. For example, in determining these amounts, the Company estimates prescription demand from the specialty pharmacies, hospital demand, buying patterns by hospitals, hospital systems and/or group purchasing organizations and the levels of inventory held by specialty distributors and customers. Making these determinations involves analyzing third-party industry data to determine whether trends in historical channel distribution patterns will predict future product sales. The Company receives data periodically from its specialty distributors and customers on inventory levels and historical channel sales mix, and the Company considers this data when determining the amount of the allowances and accruals for variable consideration.", "item_7_tables": "Table 371: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>
