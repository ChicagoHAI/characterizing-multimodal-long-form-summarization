Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our Company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6 - Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, included elsewhere within this Annual Report. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and all other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements and are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management and are made as of the date of this Annual Report. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere within this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d Definitions of capitalized terms not defined herein appear in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n2018 Highlights\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net income of $292.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $573.2 million. Trinseo noted strong performance for much of 2018. However, we finished 2018 with lower than anticipated profitability due to challenging market dynamics and economic conditions toward the end of the year, particularly in November and December. Despite this, the Company delivered strong cash generation throughout 2018 and returned significant cash to our shareholders, purchasing approximately 2.2 million ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of $142.9 million and declaring quarterly dividends for an aggregate value of $1.56 per ordinary share, or $67.2\nmillion. Refer to Non-GAAP Performance Measures\u201d below for further discussion of our use of non-GAAP measures in evaluating our performance. Other highlights of 2018 are described below.\nChief Executive Officer Transition\nOn December 11, 2018, the Company announced that our President and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher D. Pappas, intended to retire in 2019. On January 30, 2019, the Company named Frank A. Bozich the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, effective March 4, 2019, at which time Mr. Pappas will assume the role of Special Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer in order to support Mr. Bozich's transition.\nTerm Loan Repricing\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company executed a repricing of our 2024 Term Loan B, thereby reducing the stated interest rate on this facility from the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 2.00% (subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor in both instances). At current LIBOR, the Company expects an aggregate cash interest savings from this repricing of $3.5 million annually.\nNew Segmentation\nThrough December 31, 2017, the Company operated under six reporting segments: Latex Binders, Synthetic Rubber, Performance Plastics, Basic Plastics, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company realigned our reporting segments to reflect the new model under which the business is being managed and results are being reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker.\nUnder this new segmentation, we present operating results for six segments, four of which remain unchanged from the Company's prior segmentation: Latex Binders, Synthetic Rubber, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. The results of our Polystyrene business, which were previously included within the Basic Plastics segment, are now reported as a stand-alone segment. Performance Plastics, which previously consisted of compounds, blends, and ABS products sold to the automotive market, now includes the remaining portion of our ABS business, as well as the results of our SAN and PC businesses. This segmentation change provides enhanced clarity to investors by concentrating the Company's more specialized plastics into a single reporting segment, while also reducing complexity as PC and ABS are the primary inputs into the downstream production of our compounds and blends.\nPrior period financial information included within this Annual Report has been recast from its previous presentation to reflect the Company's new organizational structure.\nSSBR Capacity Expansion and Pilot Plant\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed the initial phase of the 50 KT SSBR capacity expansion at the Schkopau, Germany facility, and also opened a new SSBR pilot plant at this same facility which will expedite the product development process from lab sample to commercialization by delivering sufficient quantities of new formulations without the need to interrupt production in our industrial lines.\nResults of Operations\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016\nThe table below sets forth our historical results of operations, and these results as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. As a result of accounting guidance adopted in 2018 related to pension accounting, certain prior period financial information included in the sections below has been recast to conform to the current year presentation. Refer to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nTable 103: <table></table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,622.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,448.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,716.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,094.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,807.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,124.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n528.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n640.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n592.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n258.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n239.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n238.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n144.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n123.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n144.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n414.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n525.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n498.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n70.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on extinguishment of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n364.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n411.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n405.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n71.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n82.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n292.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n328.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n318.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 vs. 2017\nNet Sales\nThe 4% increase in net sales was primarily due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar in 2018. Overall, the impact of sales volumes was not significant, as increases in the Performance Plastics and Polystyrene segments were offset by decreases in the Feedstocks, Latex Binders, and Synthetic Rubber segments. Additionally, selling prices did not have a significant effect on net sales, as increases in the Performance Plastics, Polystyrene, and Feedstocks segments were fully offset by decreases in the Synthetic Rubber and Latex Binders segments.\nCost of Sales\nOf the 8% increase in cost of sales, 4% was due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar in 2018. Additionally, 3% of the increase was due to higher raw material costs, particularly styrene and BPA, as well as higher utility costs. Overall, the impact of sales volumes was not significant, as increases in the Performance Plastics and Polystyrene segments were offset by decreases within the Feedstocks, Latex Binders, and Synthetic Rubber segments.\nGross Profit\nThe decrease in gross profit of 17% was primarily attributable to weaker results within the Performance Plastics, Latex Binders, Polystyrene, and Synthetic Rubber segments. The weaker results were mainly due to lower margins, which were partially offset by higher sales volumes in the Performance Plastics and Polystyrene segments, as well as favorable currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar in 2018. Refer to the segment discussion below for further information.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe $19.5 million, or 8%, increase in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) is due to several factors. Higher advisory and professional fees resulted in a $14.9 million increase in external spend, primarily related to fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's recently initiated project to complete the transition of business and technical services from Dow, as well as fees related to certain growth initiatives. Additionally, approximately $4.3 million of the increase was due to currency impacts on our euro-based expenses, as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar, with an additional $3.8 million of depreciation expense compared to the prior year. Also contributing to this increase was $1.3 million in additional restructuring charges incurred compared to the prior year (refer to Note 20 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction of\napproximately $2.0 million in employee incentive compensation and other personnel costs, as well as a $2.8 million reduction in asset-related impairment charges.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThe increase in equity earnings of $20.4 million resulted from higher equity earnings from Americas Styrenics, primarily due to the impact from an extended prior year styrene outage at its St. James, Louisiana facility.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThe decrease in interest expense, net of $23.7 million was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest rates from the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017, coupled with the benefits received from the cross currency swaps that the Company entered in September 2017, which are recorded as a benefit within interest expense as a result of our adoption of new hedging accounting guidance during the second quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Long-Term Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of long-term debt was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, comprised entirely of the write-off of a portion of the existing unamortized deferred financing fees related to the 2024 Term Loan B repricing during the second quarter of 2018.\nLoss on extinguishment of long-term debt was $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which related to the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017. This amount was comprised of a $53.0 million call premium paid to retire the Company's 2022 Senior Notes and a $11.5 million write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to these notes, as well as the write-off of $0.8 million of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount related to the termination of the Company's 2021 Term Loan B.\nOther Expense (Income), net\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.5 million, which included $7.3 million of expense related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost, $0.5 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the repricing of the Company's 2024 Term Loan B during the second quarter of 2018, and other miscellaneous expenses of $0.9 million. These expenses were partially offset by net foreign exchange transaction gains for the period of $5.2 million. Net foreign exchange transactions gains included $15.8 million of foreign exchange transaction losses primarily from the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, more than offset by $21.0 million of gains from our foreign exchange forward contracts.\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21.5 million, which primarily consisted of $13.7 million of income related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and a $9.3 million gain related to the sale of the Company's 50% share in Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in January 2017 (refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Additionally, net foreign exchange transaction gains for the period were $1.4 million, which included $20.6 million of foreign exchange transaction gains primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, offset by $19.2 million of losses from our foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these net gains was $1.2 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes was $71.8 million and $82.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, each of which resulted an effective tax rate of 20%. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily driven by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, in accordance with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d signed into law on December 22, 2017, as well as a $46.8 million decrease in income before income taxes. These decreases were partially offset by a lower proportion of income before taxes attributable to non-U.S. jurisdictions, where the statutory income tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes was favorably impacted by the recording of a previously unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of $8.5 million, including penalties and interest, upon completion of the 2010 through 2013 audit with the German taxing authority. This tax benefit was partially offset by $3.1 million of income tax expense related to the revaluation of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% in accordance with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d signed into law on December 22, 2017.\n2017 vs. 2016\nNet Sales\nOf the 20% increase, 18% was due to higher selling prices primarily from the pass through of higher raw material costs, including higher styrene and butadiene costs to customers across our segments. Additionally, 1% of the increase was due to slightly higher sales volume, as increases due to Performance Plastics, Feedstocks, and Synthetic Rubber sales volume were partially offset by decreases from Latex Binders and Polystyrene sales volume.\nCost of Sales\nOf the 22% increase, 19% was attributable to higher prices for raw materials, primarily related to styrene monomer and butadiene, and an additional 1% of the increase was due to increased sales volume, primarily in Performance Plastics and Synthetic Rubber. Partially offsetting these increases was a 1% decrease related to a curtailment gain recorded in 2017 as a result of changes to certain of the Company's pension plans in Europe.\nGross Profit\nThe year-over-year 8% increase was primarily attributable to higher margins per unit sold, especially within Latex Binders and Feedstocks, due to more favorable market conditions. Higher sales volume in Performance Plastics and Synthetic Rubber was partially offset by lower sales volume in Latex Binders and Polystyrene, as well as margin compression in Performance Plastics, due to end market mix, and in Synthetic Rubber, due to unfavorable raw material timing impacts.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe $0.3 million year-over-year increase is comprised of several offsetting factors. There were increased costs incurred supporting growth initiatives of approximately $5.0 million, transaction and integration related costs of $3.4 million related to the API Plastics acquisition, and $3.6 million of asset impairment charges on certain long-lived assets within the Performance Plastics segment. Additionally, there was an increase of $2.8 million year-over-year attributable to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income in 2016. Offsetting the above increases in expenses was a decrease in restructuring expenses by $15.9 million, noting $19.9 million in asset impairment and other charges recorded in 2016 as a result of our decision to cease manufacturing operations at our latex facility in Livorno, Italy, partially offset by $3.3 million in charges in 2017 related to the upgrade and replacement of the Company's compounding facility in Terneuzen, The Netherlands as well as an additional $3.1 million of charges related to the Livorno, Italy action discussed above and further described within Note 20 in the consolidated financial statements. We also recorded a $3.1 million curtailment gain in 2017 on certain of the Company's pension plans in Europe, which further offset the increases in expenses.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity earnings decreased in 2017, as equity earnings from Americas Styrenics decreased from $135.8 million in 2016 to $122.9 million in 2017, primarily due to the planned and extended first quarter styrene outage at its St. James, Louisiana facility, including lower margins on second quarter sales of styrene purchased during the outage. Additionally, equity earnings from Sumika Styron Polycarbonate decreased from $8.9 million in 2016 to $0.8 million in 2017, as the Company completed the sale of our 50% share in the entity to Sumitomo Chemical Company Limited in January 2017, and therefore did not have an ownership interest in the joint venture for the majority of the year ended December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThe decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest rates from the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017 as well as lower deferred financing fee amortization recorded into interest expense from our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Long-Term Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of long-term debt was $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which related to the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017. This amount was comprised of a $53.0 million call premium paid to retire the Company's 2022 Senior Notes and a $11.5 million write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to these notes, as well as the write-off of $0.8 million of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount related to the termination of the Company's 2021 Term Loan B.\nOther Expense (Income), net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21.5 million, which primarily consisted of $13.7 million of income related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and a $9.3 million gain related to the sale of the Company's 50% share in Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in January 2017 (refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Additionally, net foreign exchange transaction gains for the period were $1.4 million, which included $20.6 million of foreign exchange transaction gains primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, offset by $19.2 million of losses from our foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these net gains was $1.2 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017.\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $17.9 million, which primarily consisted of $7.4 million of expense related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and an impairment charge for the loss on sale of our latex binders and PC & Compounding businesses in Brazil of $15.1 million (refer to Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Additionally, net foreign exchange transaction losses for the period were $1.8 million, which included $5.5 million of foreign exchange transaction losses primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, offset by $3.7 million of gains from our foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these net losses was $6.4 million of other income, which primarily related to the effective settlement of certain value-added tax positions during the period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes for 2017 totaled $82.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20%. Provision for income taxes for 2016 totaled $87.0 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 21%. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily due to the recording of a previously unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of $8.5 million, including penalties and interest, upon completion of the 2010 through 2013 audit with the German taxing authority during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was partially offset by $3.1 million of one-time income tax expense related to the revaluation of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% in accordance with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nIn addition, the decrease in provision for income taxes was partially offset by the tax effect on the increase in income before income taxes, which increased from $405.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $411.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelected Segment Information\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company realigned our organizational structure to reflect the new model under which the business is being managed and results are being reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker. The Company's reportable segments are as follows: Latex Binders,\nSynthetic Rubber, Performance Plastics, Polystyrene, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. Refer to Item 1 - Business for a description of our segments, including a detailed overview, products and end uses, and competition and customers.\nThe following sections describe net sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.

Partially offsetting these decreases was a 2% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $28.1 million, or 20%, including a 23% decrease due to margins, which was primarily attributable to raw material impacts as well as competitive market conditions. Additionally, lower sales volume, primarily to the Europe paper market, resulted in a 5% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 5% increase due to fixed cost improvements as well as a 2% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\n2017 vs. 2016\nOf the 19% increase in net sales, 25% was due to higher selling prices, primarily due to the pass through of higher butadiene and styrene costs to our customers. Offsetting this increase was a 4% decrease due to lower sales volume and a 3% decrease due to the net impact of the Company's acquisition of API Plastics in 2017 and the sales of our joint venture Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in 2017 and our business in Brazil in 2016.\nFull year Adjusted EBITDA was a record $138.5 million, noting stronger results from the Company's diversified chemistries and cost actions, as well as improved market conditions in Asia. Specifically, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $44.2 million, or 47%, year-over-year primarily due to margin improvements resulting from favorable market conditions, particularly in Asia, which resulted in a 65% increase. Partially offsetting these margin improvements was a 14% decrease due to lower sales volume, primarily within the North America and European paper and carpet markets. Additionally, 3% of the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was due to the net impact of the Company's acquisition of API Plastics in 2017 and the sales of our joint venture Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in 2017 and our business in Brazil in 2016.\nSynthetic Rubber Segment\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n572.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n582.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n450.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n77.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n83.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n110.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(25)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 vs. 2017\nNet sales decreased 2% from the prior year, primarily due to the pass through of lower butadiene cost, which resulted in a 6% decrease, as well as a 2% decrease due to lower sales volume due to weaker tire market conditions.

The facility came back online at full production in early April 2017. As a result of this extended outage, the Company incurred an unfavorable impact of approximately $23 million to Adjusted EBITDA, of which approximately $15 million was related to lost production margin and the remaining was related to sales of excess spot styrene following the outage. Partially offsetting the impact of this outage was an increase in Adjusted EBITDA due to higher styrene sales volume, including impacts from a stronger export market.\nOutlook\nAs noted above, we finished 2018 with lower than anticipated profitability due to challenging market dynamics and economic conditions, including weak demand in China across a number of end markets, customer destocking due to rapidly falling feedstock prices, and weak automotive and tire markets. These dynamics intensified in late November through December 2018. We expect the unfavorable market conditions that affected the latter part of 2018 to continue impacting our business in the first quarter of 2019, but with signs of market improvement across many product areas. Our results for 2019 will depend largely on the timing of market recovery in these areas. Regardless of the timing of market recovery, Trinseo remains committed to optimizing business performance, generating strong cash flow, and returning cash to shareholders.\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measure, which we define as income from continuing operations before interest expense, net; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization expense; loss on extinguishment of long-term debt; asset impairment charges; gains or losses on the dispositions of businesses and assets; restructuring charges; acquisition related costs and other items. In doing so, we are providing management, investors, and credit rating agencies with an indicator of our ongoing performance and business trends, removing the impact of transactions and events that we would not consider a part of our core operations.\nThere are limitations to using the financial performance measures such as Adjusted EBITDA. This performance measure is not intended to represent net income or other measures of financial performance. As such, it should not be used as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance. Other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use this or similarly-named financial measures that other companies may use, to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this performance measure to our net income, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n292.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n328.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n318.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n70.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n71.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n82.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n130.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n110.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n96.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEBITDA(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n540.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n591.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n576.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on extinguishment of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (gain) loss on disposition of businesses and assets(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructuring and other charges(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition transaction and integration costs(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset impairment charges or write-offs(e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther items(f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n573.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n642.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n610.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we refer to in making operating decisions because we believe it provides our management as well as our investors and credit agencies with meaningful information regarding the Company's operational performance.

Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $52.1 million, noting an increase in inventories of $16.0 million and decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities, and income taxes payable of $43.8 million and $19.7 million, respectively. These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $21.2 million. The increase in inventories was primarily due to higher days sales in inventory, partially offset by decreased raw material prices. The decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities as well as accounts receivable were primarily due to decreased raw material prices as well as lower volumes. The decrease in income taxes payable was primarily due to the overall reduction in earnings before income taxes and the mix of jurisdictional earnings.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $391.3 million, inclusive of $120.0 million in dividends from Americas Styrenics, as well as dividends from Sumika Styron Polycarbonate, $8.9 million of which were classified as operating activities, with the remaining $0.9 million classified as investing activities. Refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $126.7 million, noting increases in accounts receivable of $51.8 million and inventories of $80.2 million, respectively. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the pass through of increased raw material prices to our customers while the increase in inventories was primarily a result of building inventories in advance of certain growth initiatives.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $403.7 million, primarily due to improved net income for the period. Also impacting cash flow from operating activities for the period was $130.0 million in dividends from Americas Styrenics. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $69.8 million, noting increases in accounts receivable of $96.4 million and inventories of $51.0 million, respectively, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $57.1 million. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales and lower collections, due to timing, during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in inventory was primarily due to increases in raw material prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities was primarily due to increases in raw material prices, as noted above, as well as timing of vendor payments.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $118.7 million, primarily resulting from capital expenditures of $121.4 million. This was partially offset by proceeds received of $1.7 million from the sale of businesses and other assets, primarily comprised of $1.3 million received as a prepayment in connection with the Company's preliminary agreement for the sale of certain land in Livorno, Italy, as described further in Note 20 within the consolidated financial statements.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $182.6 million, resulting from capital expenditures of $147.4 million and cash paid to acquire API Plastics of $82.3 million during the period, net of cash acquired (refer to Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Offsetting these uses of cash was an increase from proceeds received of $42.1 million from the sale of Sumika Styron Polycarbonate during the year.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $117.3 million, resulting from capital expenditures of $123.9 million during the period, a significant portion of which related to our project to upgrade our legacy ERP environment to the latest version of SAP. Partially offsetting these capital expenditures were $1.8 million in proceeds received from the sale of our businesses in Brazil and dividends received from Sumika Styron Polycarbonate during the period, $4.8 million of which were classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, with the remaining $1.4 million classified as operating activities.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $222.2 million. This activity was primarily due to $142.9 million of payments related to the repurchase of ordinary shares, $66.0 million of dividends paid, and $7.0 million of net principal payments related to our 2024 Term Loan B during the period. Additionally, net cash used in financing activities included $8.2 million of withholding taxes paid related to the vesting of certain RSUs during the period, partially offset by $2.8 million of proceeds received from the exercise of option awards.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $253.0 million. The most significant activity during the period related to debt refinancing, which included net proceeds of $1,200.0 million from the issuance of our 2024 Term Loan B and our 2025 Senior Notes, offset by the retirement of our existing 2021 Term Loan B and 2022 Senior Notes totaling $1,238.5 million and deferred financing fees paid totaling $21.5 million. The Company also paid a call premium of $53.0 million in conjunction with the redemption of the 2022 Senior Notes. In addition, we paid $88.9 million related to the repurchase of ordinary shares as well as $58.0 million of dividends. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was $9.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of option awards.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $247.6 million. This activity was primarily from $215.1 million of payments related to the repurchase of ordinary shares during the period and $27.3 million of dividends paid, as well as $5.0 million of principal payments related to our 2021 Term Loan B.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe use Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to evaluate and discuss the Company's liquidity position and results. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operating activities, less capital expenditures. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides an indicator of the Company's ongoing ability to generate cash through core operations, as it excludes the cash impacts of various financing transactions as well as cash flows from business combinations that are not considered organic in nature. We also believe that Free Cash Flow provides management and investors with a useful analytical indicator of our ability to service our indebtedness, pay dividends (when declared), and meet our ongoing cash obligations.\nFree Cash Flow is not intended to represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, and therefore, should not be used as an alternative for that measure. Other companies in our industry may define Free Cash Flow differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use this or similarly-named financial measures that other companies may use, to compare the liquidity and cash generation of those companies to our own. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation to cash provided by operating activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n366.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n391.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n403.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(121.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(147.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(123.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree Cash Flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n245.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n243.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n279.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to the discussion above for significant impacts to cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nCapital Resources, Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe require cash principally for day-to-day operations, including the purchase of raw materials for production, to finance capital investments and other initiatives, to service our outstanding indebtedness, and to fund the return of capital to shareholders via dividend payments and ordinary share repurchases. Our sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and amounts available under the Senior Credit Facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility (discussed further below).\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $1,192.4 million and $1,199.7 million, respectively, in outstanding indebtedness and $1,094.3 million and $1,019.6 million, respectively, in working capital. In addition, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $113.7 million and $128.3 million, respectively, of foreign cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets, outside of our country of domicile of Luxembourg, all of which is readily convertible into other foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar. Our intention is not to permanently reinvest our foreign cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly, we record deferred income tax liabilities related to the unremitted earnings of our subsidiaries. For a detailed description of the Company's debt structure, borrowing rates, and expected future payment obligations, refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table outlines our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the associated interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing fees and issuance discounts. Effective interest rates for the borrowings included in the table below exclude the impact of deferred financing fee amortization, certain other fees charged to interest expense (such as fees for unused commitment fees during the period), and the impacts of derivatives designated as hedging instruments.\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Facility includes the 2022 Revolving Facility, which matures in September 2022 and has a borrowing capacity of $375.0 million. As of December 31, 2018 the Company had no outstanding borrowings, and had $360.7 million (net of $14.3 million outstanding letters of credit) of funds available for borrowing under this facility. Further, as of December 31, 2018, the Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee in respect of any unused commitments under the 2022 Revolving Facility equal to 0.375% per annum.\nAlso included in our Senior Credit Facility is our 2024 Term Loan B, which had original principal of $700.0 million, maturing in September 2024, requires scheduled quarterly payments in amounts equal to 0.25% of the original principal. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company executed a repricing of our 2024 Term Loan B, thereby reducing the stated interest rate on this facility from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 2.00% (subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor in both instances). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company made net payments of $7.0 million on the 2024 Term Loan B, with an additional $7.0 million of scheduled future payments classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nOur 2025 Senior Notes issued in August 2017 under the Indenture include $500.0 million aggregate principal\namount of 5.375% senior notes that mature on September 1, 2025. Interest on the 2025 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on May 3 and November 3 of each year, which commenced on May 3, 2018. These notes may be redeemed prior to their maturity at the option of the Company under certain circumstances at specific redemption prices. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nWe also continue to maintain our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility which, as a result of an amendment to this agreement executed during the third quarter of 2018, matures in September 2021. The borrowing capacity of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility remains $150.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility and the Company had accounts receivable available to support this facility in excess of our borrowing capacity, based on the pool of eligible accounts receivable.\nOur ability to raise additional financing and our borrowing costs may be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.\nWe and our subsidiaries, affiliates, or significant shareholders may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nTrinseo Materials Operating S.C.A. and Trinseo Materials Finance, Inc. (the Issuers\u201d of our 2025 Senior Notes and Borrowers\u201d under our Senior Credit Facility) are dependent upon the cash generation and receipt of distributions and dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint venture in order to satisfy their debt obligations. There are no known significant restrictions by third parties on the ability of subsidiaries of the Company to disburse or dividend funds to the Issuers and the Borrowers in order to satisfy these obligations. However, as the Company's subsidiaries are located in a variety of jurisdictions, the Company can give no assurances that our subsidiaries will not face transfer restrictions in the future due to regulatory or other reasons beyond our control.\nThe Senior Credit Facility and Indenture also limit the ability of the Borrowers and Issuers, respectively, to pay dividends or make other distributions to Trinseo S.A., which could then be used to make distributions to shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company declared total dividends of $1.56 per ordinary share, or $67.2 million, of which $18.2 million remains accrued as of December 31, 2018 and the majority of which will be paid in January 2019. These dividends are well within the available capacity under the terms of the restrictive covenants contained in the Senior Credit Facility and Indenture. Further, significant additional capacity continues to be available under the terms of these covenants to support expected future dividends to shareholders, should the Company continue to declare them.\nThe Company's cash flow generation in recent years has been strong, as discussed above. We believe that funds provided by operations, our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and borrowings available under our 2022 Revolving Facility and our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility will be adequate to meet planned operating and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months under current operating conditions. Nevertheless, our ability to generate future cash and to pay our indebtedness and fund other liquidation needs is subject to certain risks described under Item 1A - Risk Factors. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were in compliance with all the covenants and default provisions under our debt agreements. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information on the details of the covenant requirements.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company's ongoing business operations expose it to various risks, including fluctuating foreign exchange rates and interest rate risk. To manage this risk, the Company periodically enters into derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. A brief summary of these derivative financial instrument programs is described below; however, refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for further information. The Company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe Company adopted new hedge accounting guidance effective April 1, 2018, the impacts of which are discussed below. Refer to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further information on the new accounting guidance.\nForeign Exchange Forward Contracts\nCertain subsidiaries have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies, which creates foreign exchange risk. Our principal strategy in managing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to naturally hedge the foreign currency-denominated liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets against corresponding assets of the same currency such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in exchange rates are offset by changes in their corresponding foreign currency assets. In order to further reduce our exposure, the Company also uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on our assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies. These derivative contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.\nForeign Exchange Cash Flow Hedges\nThe Company also enters into forward contracts with the objective of managing the currency risk associated with forecasted U.S. dollar-denominated raw materials purchases by one of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro. By entering into these forward contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges, the Company buys a designated amount of U.S. dollars and sells euros at the prevailing market rate to mitigate the risk associated with the fluctuations in the euro-to-U.S. dollar foreign currency exchange rate.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest payments associated with the Company's variable rate debt. Under these interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as cash flow hedges, the Company is effectively converting a portion of our variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates.\nNet Investment Hedge\nThe Company has certain fixed-for-fixed cross currency swaps ( CCS\u201d), swapping U.S. dollar principal and interest payments on the Company's 2025 Senior Notes for euro-denominated payments, which were designated as a hedge of the Company's net investment in certain European subsidiaries under the forward method through March 31, 2018. As such, changes in their fair value, to the extent effective, were recorded within the cumulative translation adjustment account as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss ( AOCI\u201d) through March 31, 2018.\nEffective April 1, 2018, in conjunction with the adoption of recently issued hedging accounting guidance, the Company elected as an accounting policy to re-designate the CCS as a net investment hedge (and any future similar hedges) under the spot method. As such, changes in the fair value of the CCS that are included in the assessment of effectiveness (changes due to spot foreign exchange rates) are recorded as cumulative foreign currency translation within AOCI, and will remain in AOCI until either the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. As an additional accounting policy election applied to similar hedges under this new standard, the initial value of any component excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in income using a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded component and amounts recognized in income under that systematic and rational method is recognized in AOCI. The Company has elected to amortize the initial excluded component value as a reduction of Interest expense, net\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the CCS. Additionally, the accrual of periodic USD and euro-denominated interest receipts and payments under the terms of the CCS will also be recognized within Interest expense, net\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.

Additionally, lower sales volume, primarily to the Europe paper market, resulted in a 5% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 5% increase due to fixed cost improvements as well as a 2% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\n\nFull year Adjusted EBITDA was a record $138.5 million, noting stronger results from the Company's diversified chemistries and cost actions, as well as improved market conditions in Asia. Specifically, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $44.2 million, or 47%, year-over-year primarily due to margin improvements resulting from favorable market conditions, particularly in Asia, which resulted in a 65% increase. Partially offsetting these margin improvements was a 14% decrease due to lower sales volume, primarily within the North America and European paper and carpet markets. Additionally, 3% of the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was due to the net impact of the Company's acquisition of API Plastics in 2017 and the sales of our joint venture Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in 2017 and our business in Brazil in 2016.\nLoss on extinguishment of long-term debt was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, comprised entirely of the write-off of a portion of the existing unamortized deferred financing fees related to the 2024 Term Loan B repricing during the second quarter of 2018.\n2018 vs. 2017\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThe Company has certain fixed-for-fixed cross currency swaps ( CCS\u201d), swapping U.S. dollar principal and interest payments on the Company's 2025 Senior Notes for euro-denominated payments, which were designated as a hedge of the Company's net investment in certain European subsidiaries under the forward method through March 31, 2018.

These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $21.2 million. The increase in inventories was primarily due to higher days sales in inventory, partially offset by decreased raw material prices. The decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities as well as accounts receivable were primarily due to decreased raw material prices as well as lower volumes.

This decrease was partially offset by $3.1 million of one-time income tax expense related to the revaluation of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% in accordance with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n386.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n407.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n294.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n107.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n110.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n80.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $253.0 million. The most significant activity during the period related to debt refinancing, which included net proceeds of $1,200.0 million from the issuance of our 2024 Term Loan B and our 2025 Senior Notes, offset by the retirement of our existing 2021 Term Loan B and 2022 Senior Notes totaling $1,238.5 million and deferred financing fees paid totaling $21.5 million. The Company also paid a call premium of $53.0 million in conjunction with the redemption of the 2022 Senior Notes. In addition, we paid $88.9 million related to the repurchase of ordinary shares as well as $58.0 million of dividends. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was $9.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of option awards.\n (1) We have certain raw material purchase contracts where we are required to purchase certain minimum volumes at the then prevailing market prices. These commitments range from one to three years. In certain raw material purchase contracts, we have the right to purchase less than required minimums and pay a liquidated damages fee, or, in case of a permanent plant shutdown, to terminate the contracts. In such cases these obligations would be less than the obligations shown in the table above. \nProvision for income taxes was $71.8 million and $82.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, each of which resulted an effective tax rate of 20%. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily driven by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, in accordance with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d signed into law on December 22, 2017, as well as a $46.8 million decrease in income before income taxes. These decreases were partially offset by a lower proportion of income before taxes attributable to non-U.S. jurisdictions, where the statutory income tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $42.0 million, or 18%, primarily due to lower margins, which resulted in a 31% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. These lower margins were due to a combination of factors, including generally higher raw material costs, a slowdown in the automotive industry, and trade uncertainty in China, as well as end market mix. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 6% increase due to higher sales volume, particularly from the Company's ABS expansion in China, a 5% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period, and a 2% increase due to increased volumes from the acquisition of API Plastics.\n (b) Net (gain) loss on disposition of businesses and

At current LIBOR, the Company expects an aggregate cash interest savings from this repricing of $3.5 million annually.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n292.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n328.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n318.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n70.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n71.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n82.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n130.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n110.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n96.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEBITDA(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n540.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n591.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n576.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on extinguishment of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (gain) loss on disposition of businesses and assets(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructuring and other charges(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition transaction and integration costs(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset impairment charges or write-offs(e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther items(f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n573.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n642.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n610.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe and our subsidiaries, affiliates, or significant shareholders may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise.

The amounts above include estimated interest on the 2024 Term Loan B and the related effects of interest rate swap agreements, as well as interest on the 2025 Senior Notes; however, they do not include the impacts of certain fixed-for-fixed cross currency swaps. Interest on the 2024 Term Loan B is payable quarterly and interest on the 2025 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on each May 3 and November 3. Refer to\nThe decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest rates from the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017 as well as lower deferred financing fee amortization recorded into interest expense from our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nGross Profit\nOf the 11% increase in net sales, 4% was due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period and 3% was due to higher sales volume, mainly from the Company's ABS expansion in China. Additionally, 2% of the net sales increase was due to price increases, mainly from higher polycarbonate prices, and 2% of the increase was due to increased volumes from the acquisition of API Plastics.\nOur 2025 Senior Notes issued in August 2017 under the Indenture include $500.0 million aggregate principal\nOther Expense (Income), net\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nForeign Exchange Forward Contracts\n\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $118.7 million, primarily resulting from capital expenditures of $121.4 million. This was partially offset by proceeds received of $1.7 million from the sale of businesses and other assets, primarily comprised of $1.3 million received as a prepayment in connection with the Company's preliminary agreement for the sale of certain land in Livorno, Italy, as described further in Note 20 within the consolidated financial statements.\n2017 vs. 2016\nSynthetic Rubber, Performance Plastics, Polystyrene, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. Refer to Item 1 - Business for a description of our segments, including a detailed overview, products and end uses, and competition and customers.\nWe require cash principally for day-to-day operations, including the purchase of raw materials for production, to finance capital investments and other initiatives, to service our outstanding indebtedness, and to fund the return of capital to shareholders via dividend payments and ordinary share repurchases. Our sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and amounts available under the Senior Credit Facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility (discussed further below).\n (f) Other items for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily relate to advisory and professional fees incurred in conjunction with our initiative to transition business services from Dow, including certain administrative services such as accounts payable, logistics, and IT services, as well as fees incurred in conjunction with the 2024 Term Loan B repricing completed during the second quarter of 2018. Other items for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relate to a curtailment gain recorded on certain of the Company's pension plans in Europe, offset by fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's debt refinancing which was completed during the third quarter of 2017. Other items for the year ended December 31, 2016 include other income of $6.9 million from the effective settlement of certain value-added tax positions, offset by $2.5 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's secondary offerings completed during the year. \n (c) Restructuring and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily relate to employee termination benefit charges incurred in connection with restructuring in our Synthetic Rubber segment. A portion of the restructuring charges for 2018 and the majority of the restructuring and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 relate to decommissioning, contract termination, and employee termination benefit charges incurred in connection with the upgrade and replacement of our compounding facility in Terneuzen, The Netherlands as well as our decision to cease manufacturing activities at our latex binders manufacturing facility in Livorno, Italy. Restructuring and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 relate primarily to $20.0 million in charges incurred in connection with the Livorno, Italy action discussed above. The remaining restructuring charges for 2016 relate to the Company's decision to divest our operations in Brazil as well as the closure of our Allyn's Point latex binders manufacturing facility. Refer to Note 20 in the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding restructuring activities. \n2017 vs. 2016\nWe also continue to maintain our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility which, as a result of an amendment to this agreement executed during the third quarter of 2018, matures in September 2021. The borrowing capacity of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility remains $150.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility and the Company had accounts receivable available to support this facility in excess of our borrowing capacity, based on the pool of eligible accounts receivable.\nEquity earnings decreased in 2017, as equity earnings from Americas Styrenics decreased from $135.8 million in 2016 to $122.9 million in 2017, primarily due to the planned and extended first quarter styrene outage at its St. James, Louisiana facility, including lower margins on second quarter sales of styrene purchased during the outage. Additionally, equity earnings from Sumika Styron Polycarbonate decreased from $8.9 million in 2016 to $0.8 million in 2017, as the Company completed the sale of our 50% share in the entity to Sumitomo Chemical Company Limited in January 2017, and therefore did not have an ownership interest in the joint venture for the majority of the year ended December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n2018 vs. 2017\nDerivative Instruments\n\nThe 4% increase in net sales was primarily due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar in 2018. Overall, the impact of sales volumes was not significant, as increases in the Performance Plastics and Polystyrene segments were offset by decreases in the Feedstocks, Latex Binders, and Synthetic Rubber segments. Additionally, selling prices did not have a significant effect on net sales, as increases in the Performance Plastics, Polystyrene, and Feedstocks segments were fully offset by decreases in the Synthetic Rubber and Latex Binders segments.\nThe majority of the overall $27.6 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to unfavorable raw material timing resulting from a favorable impact in 2016 compared to an unfavorable impact in the 2017, which resulted in a 15% decrease due to lower margins. Higher fixed costs as well as sales volume mix resulted in a 10% decrease primarily from growth initiatives, including our SSBR capacity expansion and SSBR pilot plant development.\n2017 vs. 2016\nNote that the accelerated depreciation charges incurred as part of both the upgrade and replacement of the Company's compounding facility in Terneuzen, The Netherlands as well as the Allyn's Point shutdown are included within the Depreciation and amortization\u201d caption above, and therefore are not included as a separate adjustment within this caption.\nThe following table outlines our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the associated interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing fees and issuance discounts. Effective interest rates for the borrowings included in the table below exclude the impact of deferred financing fee amortization, certain other fees charged to interest expense (such as fees for unused commitment fees during the period), and the impacts of derivatives designated as hedging instruments.\nIn addition, the decrease in provision for income taxes was partially offset by the tax effect on the increase in income before income taxes, which increased from $405.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $411.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21.5 million, which primarily consisted of $13.7 million of income related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and a $9.3 million gain related to the sale of the Company's 50% share in Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in January 2017 (refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Additionally, net foreign exchange transaction gains for the period were $1.4 million, which included $20.6 million of foreign exchange transaction gains primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, offset by $19.2 million of losses from our foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these net gains was $1.2 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017.\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. Amounts we pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table:\nNet Investment Hedge\nInterest Rate Swaps\n\nAlso included in our Senior Credit Facility is our 2024 Term Loan B, which had original principal of $700.0 million, maturing in September 2024, requires scheduled quarterly payments in amounts equal to 0.25% of the original principal. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company executed a repricing of our 2024 Term Loan B, thereby reducing the stated interest rate on this facility from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 2.00% (subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor in both instances). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company made net payments of $7.0 million on the 2024 Term Loan B, with an additional $7.0 million of scheduled future payments classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\n2017 vs. 2016\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $391.3 million, inclusive of $120.0 million in dividends from Americas Styrenics, as well as dividends from Sumika Styron Polycarbonate, $8.9 million of which were classified as operating activities, with the remaining $0.9 million classified as investing activities. Refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $126.7 million, noting increases in accounts receivable of $51.8 million and inventories of $80.2 million, respectively. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the pass through of increased raw material prices to our customers while the increase in inventories was primarily a result of building inventories in advance of certain growth initiatives.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $247.6 million. This activity was primarily from $215.1 million of payments related to the repurchase of ordinary shares during the period and $27.3 million of dividends paid, as well as $5.0 million of principal payments related to our 2021 Term Loan B.\nThe 5% decrease in net sales was comprised of several mostly offsetting factors. Lower styrene related sales volume resulted in a 10% decrease, which was partially offset by a 2% increase due to higher prices and a 3% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\n (d) Acquisition transaction and integration costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 relate to advisory and professional fees incurred in conjunction with our acquisition of API Plastics, which closed in July 2017. Additionally, the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a non-cash fair value inventory adjustment incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of API Plastics. Refer to Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for further information. \nCost of Sales\nCapital Resources, Indebtedness and Liquidity\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $222.2 million. This activity was primarily due to $142.9 million of payments related to the repurchase of ordinary shares, $66.0 million of dividends paid, and $7.0 million of net principal payments related to our 2024 Term Loan B during the period. Additionally, net cash used in financing activities included $8.2 million of withholding taxes paid related to the vesting of certain RSUs during the period, partially offset by $2.8 million of proceeds received from the exercise of option awards.\nWe use Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to evaluate and discuss the Company's liquidity position and results. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operating activities, less capital expenditures. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides an indicator of the Company's ongoing ability to generate cash through core operations, as it excludes the cash impacts of various financing transactions as well as cash flows from business combinations that are not considered organic in nature. We also believe that Free Cash Flow provides management and investors with a useful analytical indicator of our ability to service our indebtedness, pay dividends (when declared), and meet our ongoing cash obligations.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measure, which we define as income from continuing operations before interest expense, net; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization expense; loss on extinguishment of long-term debt; asset impairment charges; gains or losses on the dispositions of businesses and assets; restructuring charges; acquisition related costs and other items. In doing so, we are providing management, investors, and credit rating agencies with an indicator of our ongoing performance and business trends, removing the impact of transactions and events that we would not consider a part of our core operations.\nSelected Segment Information\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.5 million, which included $7.3 million of expense related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost, $0.5 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the repricing of the Company's 2024 Term Loan B during the second quarter of 2018, and other miscellaneous expenses of $0.9 million. These expenses were partially offset by net foreign exchange transaction gains for the period of $5.2 million. Net foreign exchange transactions gains included $15.8 million of foreign exchange transaction losses primarily from the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, more than offset by $21.0 million of gains from our foreign exchange forward contracts.\nOf the 14% increase in net sales, 16% was due to higher selling prices due to the pass through of higher styrene costs to customers, partially offset by a 4% decrease due to lower sales volume in Asia, with an increased focus on higher margin business.\nThe following sections describe net sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Intersegment sales have been eliminated. Refer to Note 19 in the consolidated financial statements for a detailed definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of income before income taxes to segment Adjusted EBITDA.\n2018 Highlights\nFeedstocks Segment\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company realigned our organizational structure to reflect the new model under which the business is being managed and results are being reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker. The Company's reportable segments are as follows: Latex Binders,\nThe Company's ongoing business operations expose it to various risks, including fluctuating foreign exchange rates and interest rate risk. To manage this risk, the Company periodically enters into derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. A brief summary of these derivative financial instrument programs is described below; however, refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for further information. The Company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n\nThe $19.5 million, or 8%, increase in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) is due to several factors. Higher advisory and professional fees resulted in a $14.9 million increase in external spend, primarily related to fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's recently initiated project to complete the transition of business and technical services from Dow, as well as fees related to certain growth initiatives. Additionally, approximately $4.3 million of the increase was due to currency impacts on our euro-based expenses, as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar, with an additional $3.8 million of depreciation expense compared to the prior year. Also contributing to this increase was $1.3 million in additional restructuring charges incurred compared to the prior year (refer to Note 20 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction of\nOur ability to raise additional financing and our borrowing costs may be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.\nEffective April 1, 2018, in conjunction with the adoption of recently issued hedging accounting guidance, the Company elected as an accounting policy to re-designate the CCS as a net investment hedge (and any future similar hedges) under the spot method. As such, changes in the fair value of the CCS that are included in the assessment of effectiveness (changes due to spot foreign exchange rates) are recorded as cumulative foreign currency translation within AOCI, and will remain in AOCI until either the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. As an additional accounting policy election applied to similar hedges under this new standard, the initial value of any component excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in income using a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded component and amounts recognized in income under that systematic and rational method is recognized in AOCI. The Company has elected to amortize the initial excluded component value as a reduction of Interest expense, net\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the CCS. Additionally, the accrual of periodic USD and euro-denominated interest receipts and payments under the terms of the CCS will also be recognized within Interest expense, net\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nInvesting Activities\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $17.9 million, which primarily consisted of $7.4 million of expense related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and an impairment charge for the loss on sale of our latex binders and PC & Compounding businesses in Brazil of $15.1 million (refer to Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Additionally, net foreign exchange transaction losses for the period were $1.8 million, which included $5.5 million of foreign exchange transaction losses primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, offset by $3.7 million of gains from our foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these net losses was $6.4 million of other income, which primarily related to the effective settlement of certain value-added tax positions during the period.\nOf the 17% increase in net sales, 9% was due to higher selling prices, primarily due to the pass through of higher raw material costs to our customers. Additionally, 6% of the increase was due to increased volumes, primarily related to the ABS expansion in China, as well as higher sales in the automotive markets in all regions and in the consumer electronics market in Asia.\n2018 vs. 2017\nOf the 3% decrease in net sales, 2% was due to lower pricing from the pass through of lower raw material costs, as well as competitive market conditions, and 3% was due to lower sales volume, mainly to the European paper market. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 2% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\nThrough December 31, 2017, the Company operated under six reporting segments: Latex Binders, Synthetic Rubber, Performance Plastics, Basic Plastics, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company realigned our reporting segments to reflect the new model under which the business is being managed and results are being reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker.\nThe decrease in interest expense, net of $23.7 million was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest rates from the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017, coupled with the benefits received from the cross currency swaps that the Company entered in September 2017, which are recorded as a benefit within interest expense as a result of our adoption of new hedging accounting guidance during the second quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $6.3 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year. Of this decrease, 11% was due to lower margins and 3% was due to lower sales volume, both attributable primarily to weaker tire market conditions. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 5% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period, as well as a 2% increase due to fixed cost improvements.\nOf the 29% increase in net sales, 25% was due to higher selling prices, primarily resulting from the pass through of higher butadiene and styrene costs to customers. Additionally, 3% of the increase was due to record sales volume which was a result of higher customer demand for SSBR, as well as higher sales of Ni-PBR.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $117.3 million, resulting from capital expenditures of $123.9 million during the period, a significant portion of which related to our project to upgrade our legacy ERP environment to the latest version of SAP. Partially offsetting these capital expenditures were $1.8 million in proceeds received from the sale of our businesses in Brazil and dividends received from Sumika Styron Polycarbonate during the period, $4.8 million of which were classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, with the remaining $1.4 million classified as operating activities.\nOf the 8% increase in cost of sales, 4% was due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar in 2018. Additionally, 3% of the increase was due to higher raw material costs, particularly styrene and BPA, as well as higher utility costs. Overall, the impact of sales volumes was not significant, as increases in the Performance Plastics and Polystyrene segments were offset by decreases within the Feedstocks, Latex Binders, and Synthetic Rubber segments.\nOther Expense (Income), net\nThe table below sets forth our historical results of operations, and these results as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. As a result of accounting guidance adopted in 2018 related to pension accounting, certain prior period financial information included in the sections below has been recast to conform to the current year presentation. Refer to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nSynthetic Rubber Segment\nSSBR Capacity Expansion and Pilot Plant\nNet Sales\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $1,192.4 million and $1,199.7 million, respectively, in outstanding indebtedness and $1,094.3 million and $1,019.6 million, respectively, in working capital. In addition, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $113.7 million and $128.3 million, respectively, of foreign cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets, outside of our country of domicile of Luxembourg, all of which is readily convertible into other foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar. Our intention is not to permanently reinvest our foreign cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly, we record deferred income tax liabilities related to the unremitted earnings of our subsidiaries. For a detailed description of the Company's debt structure, borrowing rates, and expected future payment obligations, refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThe $14.5 million, or 30%, decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower margins, mostly from weaker third quarter market conditions, as well as higher raw material costs, which resulted in a 51% decrease. Partially offsetting this decrease were fixed cost reductions, which resulted in a 9% increase in Adjusted EBITDA, and a 7% increase due to higher sales volumes in Europe and Asia. Additionally, there was a 6% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\nOf the 20% increase, 18% was due to higher selling prices primarily from the pass through of higher raw material costs, including higher styrene and butadiene costs to customers across our segments. Additionally, 1% of the increase was due to slightly higher sales volume, as increases due to Performance Plastics, Feedstocks, and Synthetic Rubber sales volume were partially offset by decreases from Latex Binders and Polystyrene sales volume.\nPerformance Plastics Segment\nCost of Sales\n2018 vs. 2017\nAmericas Styrenics Segment\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe increase in equity earnings of $20.4 million resulted from higher equity earnings from Americas Styrenics, primarily due to the impact from an extended prior year styrene outage at its St. James, Louisiana facility.\nPrior period financial information included within this Annual Report has been recast from its previous presentation to reflect the Company's new organizational structure.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net income of $292.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $573.2 million. Trinseo noted strong performance for much of 2018. However, we finished 2018 with lower than anticipated profitability due to challenging market dynamics and economic conditions toward the end of the year, particularly in November and December. Despite this, the Company delivered strong cash generation throughout 2018 and returned significant cash to our shareholders, purchasing approximately 2.2 million ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of $142.9 million and declaring quarterly dividends for an aggregate value of $1.56 per ordinary share, or $67.2\nThe $0.3 million year-over-year increase is comprised of several offsetting factors. There were increased costs incurred supporting growth initiatives of approximately $5.0 million, transaction and integration related costs of $3.4 million related to the API Plastics acquisition, and $3.6 million of asset impairment charges on certain long-lived assets within the Performance Plastics segment. Additionally, there was an increase of $2.8 million year-over-year attributable to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income in 2016. Offsetting the above increases in expenses was a decrease in restructuring expenses by $15.9 million, noting $19.9 million in asset impairment and other charges recorded in 2016 as a result of our decision to cease manufacturing operations at our latex facility in Livorno, Italy, partially offset by $3.3 million in charges in 2017 related to the upgrade and replacement of the Company's compounding facility in Terneuzen, The Netherlands as well as an additional $3.1 million of charges related to the Livorno, Italy action discussed above and further described within Note 20 in the consolidated financial statements. We also recorded a $3.1 million curtailment gain in 2017 on certain of the Company's pension plans in Europe, which further offset the increases in expenses.\nNet sales decreased 2% from the prior year, primarily due to the pass through of lower butadiene cost, which resulted in a 6% decrease, as well as a 2% decrease due to lower sales volume due to weaker tire market conditions. These decreases were partially offset by a 6% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFree Cash Flow is not intended to represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, and therefore, should not be used as an alternative for that measure. Other companies in our industry may define Free Cash Flow differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use this or similarly-named financial measures that other companies may use, to compare the liquidity and cash generation of those companies to our own. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation to cash provided by operating activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\n (e) Asset impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 relate to the impairment of certain corporate long-lived assets and certain long-lived assets within the Company's Performance Plastics segment, respectively. \nFree Cash Flow\nOur Senior Credit Facility includes the 2022 Revolving Facility, which matures in September 2022 and has a borrowing capacity of $375.0 million. As of December 31, 2018 the Company had no outstanding borrowings, and had $360.7 million (net of $14.3 million outstanding letters of credit) of funds available for borrowing under this facility. Further, as of December 31, 2018, the Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee in respect of any unused commitments under the 2022 Revolving Facility equal to 0.375% per annum.\n\nThe table below summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. We have derived the summarized cash flow information from our audited financial statements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $403.7 million, primarily due to improved net income for the period. Also impacting cash flow from operating activities for the period was $130.0 million in dividends from Americas Styrenics. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $69.8 million, noting increases in accounts receivable of $96.4 million and inventories of $51.0 million, respectively, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $57.1 million. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales and lower collections, due to timing, during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in inventory was primarily due to increases in raw material prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities was primarily due to increases in raw material prices, as noted above, as well as timing of vendor payments.\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our Company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6 - Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, included elsewhere within this Annual Report. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and all other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements and are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management and are made as of the date of this Annual Report. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere within this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d Definitions of capitalized terms not defined herein appear in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $1.3 million, or 1%, due to several factors. Higher fixed costs resulted in a 6% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. An additional 3% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was due to margin compression from end market mix in ABS, which was partially offset by margin expansion in PC. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 10% increase in Adjusted EBITDA due to increased sales volumes from the ABS expansion in China as well as from the automotive markets in all regions and in the consumer electronics market in Asia. Additionally, 2% of the decrease was due to the net impact of the Company's acquisition of API Plastics in 2017 and the sales of our joint venture Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in 2017 and our business in Brazil in 2016.\n\nThe Company also enters into forward contracts with the objective of managing the currency risk associated with forecasted U.S. dollar-denominated raw materials purchases by one of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro. By entering into these forward contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges, the Company buys a designated amount of U.S. dollars and sells euros at the prevailing market rate to mitigate the risk associated with the fluctuations in the euro-to-U.S. dollar foreign currency exchange rate.\n2017 vs. 2016\n\nFinancing Activities\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016\nOutlook\nOperating Activities\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest payments associated with the Company's variable rate debt. Under these interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as cash flow hedges, the Company is effectively converting a portion of our variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates.\n2018 vs. 2017\nProvision for Income Taxes\nCertain subsidiaries have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies, which creates foreign exchange risk. Our principal strategy in managing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to naturally hedge the foreign currency-denominated liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets against corresponding assets of the same currency such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in exchange rates are offset by changes in their corresponding foreign currency assets. In order to further reduce our exposure, the Company also uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on our assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies. These derivative contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.\nCash Flows\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOf the 19% increase in net sales, 25% was due to higher selling prices, primarily due to the pass through of higher butadiene and styrene costs to our customers. Offsetting this increase was a 4% decrease due to lower sales volume and a 3% decrease due to the net impact of the Company's acquisition of API Plastics in 2017 and the sales of our joint venture Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in 2017 and our business in Brazil in 2016.\nOn December 11, 2018, the Company announced that our President and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher D. Pappas, intended to retire in 2019. On January 30, 2019, the Company named Frank A. Bozich the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, effective March 4, 2019, at which time Mr. Pappas will assume the role of Special Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer in order to support Mr. Bozich's transition.\nLatex Binders Segment\n*The results of this segment are comprised entirely of earnings from Americas Styrenics, our equity method investment. As such, Adjusted EBITDA related to this segment is included within Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Senior Credit Facility and Indenture also limit the ability of the Borrowers and Issuers, respectively, to pay dividends or make other distributions to Trinseo S.A., which could then be used to make distributions to shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company declared total dividends of $1.56 per ordinary share, or $67.2 million, of which $18.2 million remains accrued as of December 31, 2018 and the majority of which will be paid in January 2019. These dividends are well within the available capacity under the terms of the restrictive covenants contained in the Senior Credit Facility and Indenture. Further, significant additional capacity continues to be available under the terms of these covenants to support expected future dividends to shareholders, should the Company continue to declare them.\n2017 vs. 2016\nTerm Loan Repricing\nThe decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 million, or 3%, was mainly due to a decline in margin, which resulted in a 14% decrease. Higher styrene margins over raw materials in Europe and Asia were more than offset by the impact of raw material timing, particularly with declining benzene costs in the fourth quarter. This decrease was partially offset by an 8% increase due to currency impacts, as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period, as well as a 3% increase due to fixed costs improvements.\nNew Segmentation\nPolystyrene Segment\nNet Sales\n\n businesses. In 2018, these amounts related to consideration earned for the subsequent performance of our former latex business. For 2016, these amounts reflect the impairment changes recorded for the original loss on sale of this operating entity in Brazil. Net gain on disposition of businesses and assets during the year ended December 31, 2017 relates primarily to the sale of our 50% share in Sumika Styron Polycarbonate to Sumitomo Chemical Company Limited, for which the Company recorded a gain on sale of $9.3 million during the period. Refer to Note 4 and Note 5, respectively, in the consolidated financial statements for further information. \nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21.5 million, which primarily consisted of $13.7 million of income related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and a $9.3 million gain related to the sale of the Company's 50% share in Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in January 2017 (refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Additionally, net foreign exchange transaction gains for the period were $1.4 million, which included $20.6 million of foreign exchange transaction gains primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, offset by $19.2 million of losses from our foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these net gains was $1.2 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017.\nThe year-over-year 8% increase was primarily attributable to higher margins per unit sold, especially within Latex Binders and Feedstocks, due to more favorable market conditions. Higher sales volume in Performance Plastics and Synthetic Rubber was partially offset by lower sales volume in Latex Binders and Polystyrene, as well as margin compression in Performance Plastics, due to end market mix, and in Synthetic Rubber, due to unfavorable raw material timing impacts.\nThe Company's cash flow generation in recent years has been strong, as discussed above. We believe that funds provided by operations, our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and borrowings available under our 2022 Revolving Facility and our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility will be adequate to meet planned operating and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months under current operating conditions. Nevertheless, our ability to generate future cash and to pay our indebtedness and fund other liquidation needs is subject to certain risks described under Item 1A - Risk Factors. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were in compliance with all the covenants and default provisions under our debt agreements. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information on the details of the covenant requirements.\nAs noted above, we finished 2018 with lower than anticipated profitability due to challenging market dynamics and economic conditions, including weak demand in China across a number of end markets, customer destocking due to rapidly falling feedstock prices, and weak automotive and tire markets. These dynamics intensified in late November through December 2018. We expect the unfavorable market conditions that affected the latter part of 2018 to continue impacting our business in the first quarter of 2019, but with signs of market improvement across many product areas. Our results for 2019 will depend largely on the timing of market recovery in these areas. Regardless of the timing of market recovery, Trinseo remains committed to optimizing business performance, generating strong cash flow, and returning cash to shareholders.\n2018 vs. 2017\nThe 17% increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an extended production outage in 2017 at the Americas Styrenics' St. James, Louisiana facility, described more fully below.\napproximately $2.0 million in employee incentive compensation and other personnel costs, as well as a $2.8 million reduction in asset-related impairment charges.\nThe 9% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the planned first quarter of 2017 styrene outage at the Americas Styrenics' St. James, Louisiana facility, which was extended in order to complete repairs on critical equipment. The facility came back online at full production in early April 2017. As a result of this extended outage, the Company incurred an unfavorable impact of approximately $23 million to Adjusted EBITDA, of which approximately $15 million was related to lost production margin and the remaining was related to sales of excess spot styrene following the outage. Partially offsetting the impact of this outage was an increase in Adjusted EBITDA due to higher styrene sales volume, including impacts from a stronger export market.\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\nOf the 22% increase, 19% was attributable to higher prices for raw materials, primarily related to styrene monomer and butadiene, and an additional 1% of the increase was due to increased sales volume, primarily in Performance Plastics and Synthetic Rubber. Partially offsetting these increases was a 1% decrease related to a curtailment gain recorded in 2017 as a result of changes to certain of the Company's pension plans in Europe.\n (a) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we refer to in making operating decisions because we believe it provides our management as well as our investors and credit agencies with meaningful information regarding the Company's operational performance. We believe the use of EBITDA as a metric assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis. Other companies in our industry may define EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use EBITDA, or similarly-named financial measures that other companies may use, to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of our EBITDA results to our net income, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. \n (2) The long-term indebtedness line in the table includes obligations on our outstanding borrowing amounts as of December 31, 2018, which are related to the 2024 Term Loan B and the 2025 Senior Notes. The impacts of certain fixed-for-fixed cross currency swaps, which are discussed in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, as well as all other debt outstanding as of December 31, 2018 totaling $1.1 million are not included in this line. \nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $4.1 million, or 8%, primarily due to a 6% decrease from lower sales volumes, particularly in Asia, as well as a 4% decrease due to lower margins in Europe, which were impacted by higher raw material costs. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 3% increase due to lower fixed costs.\nThe 38% increase in net sales was mainly due to the pass through of higher styrene prices, which contributed to 27% of the increase. Higher styrene-related sales volume also resulted in a 10% increase in net sales.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed the initial phase of the 50 KT SSBR capacity expansion at the Schkopau, Germany facility, and also opened a new SSBR pilot plant at this same facility which will expedite the product development process from lab sample to commercialization by delivering sufficient quantities of new formulations without the need to interrupt production in our industrial lines.\nChief Executive Officer Transition\nThe Company adopted new hedge accounting guidance effective April 1, 2018, the impacts of which are discussed below. Refer to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further information on the new accounting guidance.\n2017 vs. 2016\nForeign Exchange Cash Flow Hedges\nRefer to the discussion above for significant impacts to cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThere are limitations to using the financial performance measures such as Adjusted EBITDA. This performance measure is not intended to represent net income or other measures of financial performance. As such, it should not be used as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance. Other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use this or similarly-named financial measures that other companies may use, to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this performance measure to our net income, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).\nGross Profit", "item_7_text": " \nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $28.1 million, or 20%, including a 23% decrease due to margins, which was primarily attributable to raw material impacts as well as competitive market conditions. Additionally, lower sales volume, primarily to the Europe paper market, resulted in a 5% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 5% increase due to fixed cost improvements as well as a 2% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\n\nFull year Adjusted EBITDA was a record $138.5 million, noting stronger results from the Company's diversified chemistries and cost actions, as well as improved market conditions in Asia. Specifically, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $44.2 million, or 47%, year-over-year primarily due to margin improvements resulting from favorable market conditions, particularly in Asia, which resulted in a 65% increase. Partially offsetting these margin improvements was a 14% decrease due to lower sales volume, primarily within the North America and European paper and carpet markets. Additionally, 3% of the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was due to the net impact of the Company's acquisition of API Plastics in 2017 and the sales of our joint venture Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in 2017 and our business in Brazil in 2016.\nLoss on extinguishment of long-term debt was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, comprised entirely of the write-off of a portion of the existing unamortized deferred financing fees related to the 2024 Term Loan B repricing during the second quarter of 2018.\n2018 vs. 2017\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThe Company has certain fixed-for-fixed cross currency swaps ( CCS\u201d), swapping U.S. dollar principal and interest payments on the Company's 2025 Senior Notes for euro-denominated payments, which were designated as a hedge of the Company's net investment in certain European subsidiaries under the forward method through March 31, 2018. As such, changes in their fair value, to the extent effective, were recorded within the cumulative translation adjustment account as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss ( AOCI\u201d) through March 31, 2018.\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes was favorably impacted by the recording of a previously unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of $8.5 million, including penalties and interest, upon completion of the 2010 through 2013 audit with the German taxing authority. This tax benefit was partially offset by $3.1 million of income tax expense related to the revaluation of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% in accordance with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nUnder this new segmentation, we present operating results for six segments, four of which remain unchanged from the Company's prior segmentation: Latex Binders, Synthetic Rubber, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. The results of our Polystyrene business, which were previously included within the Basic Plastics segment, are now reported as a stand-alone segment. Performance Plastics, which previously consisted of compounds, blends, and ABS products sold to the automotive market, now includes the remaining portion of our ABS business, as well as the results of our SAN and PC businesses. This segmentation change provides enhanced clarity to investors by concentrating the Company's more specialized plastics into a single reporting segment, while also reducing complexity as PC and ABS are the primary inputs into the downstream production of our compounds and blends.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Long-Term Debt\nThe 38% increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher margins as a result of favorable market conditions, which resulted in a 44% increase in Adjusted EBITDA, but was slightly offset by a 7% decrease due to higher maintenance-related fixed costs.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Long-Term Debt\nThe decrease in gross profit of 17% was primarily attributable to weaker results within the Performance Plastics, Latex Binders, Polystyrene, and Synthetic Rubber segments. The weaker results were mainly due to lower margins, which were partially offset by higher sales volumes in the Performance Plastics and Polystyrene segments, as well as favorable currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar in 2018. Refer to the segment discussion below for further information.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $366.5 million, inclusive of $117.5 million in dividends from Americas Styrenics. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $52.1 million, noting an increase in inventories of $16.0 million and decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities, and income taxes payable of $43.8 million and $19.7 million, respectively. These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $21.2 million. The increase in inventories was primarily due to higher days sales in inventory, partially offset by decreased raw material prices. The decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities as well as accounts receivable were primarily due to decreased raw material prices as well as lower volumes. The decrease in income taxes payable was primarily due to the overall reduction in earnings before income taxes and the mix of jurisdictional earnings.\namount of 5.375% senior notes that mature on September 1, 2025. Interest on the 2025 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on May 3 and November 3 of each year, which commenced on May 3, 2018. These notes may be redeemed prior to their maturity at the option of the Company under certain circumstances at specific redemption prices. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n2018 vs. 2017\nProvision for income taxes for 2017 totaled $82.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20%. Provision for income taxes for 2016 totaled $87.0 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 21%. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily due to the recording of a previously unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of $8.5 million, including penalties and interest, upon completion of the 2010 through 2013 audit with the German taxing authority during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was partially offset by $3.1 million of one-time income tax expense related to the revaluation of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% in accordance with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $253.0 million. The most significant activity during the period related to debt refinancing, which included net proceeds of $1,200.0 million from the issuance of our 2024 Term Loan B and our 2025 Senior Notes, offset by the retirement of our existing 2021 Term Loan B and 2022 Senior Notes totaling $1,238.5 million and deferred financing fees paid totaling $21.5 million. The Company also paid a call premium of $53.0 million in conjunction with the redemption of the 2022 Senior Notes. In addition, we paid $88.9 million related to the repurchase of ordinary shares as well as $58.0 million of dividends. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was $9.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of option awards.\n (1) We have certain raw material purchase contracts where we are required to purchase certain minimum volumes at the then prevailing market prices. These commitments range from one to three years. In certain raw material purchase contracts, we have the right to purchase less than required minimums and pay a liquidated damages fee, or, in case of a permanent plant shutdown, to terminate the contracts. In such cases these obligations would be less than the obligations shown in the table above. \nProvision for income taxes was $71.8 million and $82.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, each of which resulted an effective tax rate of 20%. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily driven by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, in accordance with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d signed into law on December 22, 2017, as well as a $46.8 million decrease in income before income taxes. These decreases were partially offset by a lower proportion of income before taxes attributable to non-U.S. jurisdictions, where the statutory income tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $42.0 million, or 18%, primarily due to lower margins, which resulted in a 31% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. These lower margins were due to a combination of factors, including generally higher raw material costs, a slowdown in the automotive industry, and trade uncertainty in China, as well as end market mix. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 6% increase due to higher sales volume, particularly from the Company's ABS expansion in China, a 5% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period, and a 2% increase due to increased volumes from the acquisition of API Plastics.\n (b) Net (gain) loss on disposition of businesses and assets during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016 related to the sale of our primary operating entity in Brazil, which includes both latex binders and PC & Compounding \nOf the 8% increase in net sales, 4% was due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period, 2% was due to higher selling prices due to the pass through of higher styrene costs to customers, and 2% was due to higher sales volume in Europe and Asia.\nmillion. Refer to Non-GAAP Performance Measures\u201d below for further discussion of our use of non-GAAP measures in evaluating our performance. Other highlights of 2018 are described below.\nTrinseo Materials Operating S.C.A. and Trinseo Materials Finance, Inc. (the Issuers\u201d of our 2025 Senior Notes and Borrowers\u201d under our Senior Credit Facility) are dependent upon the cash generation and receipt of distributions and dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint venture in order to satisfy their debt obligations. There are no known significant restrictions by third parties on the ability of subsidiaries of the Company to disburse or dividend funds to the Issuers and the Borrowers in order to satisfy these obligations. However, as the Company's subsidiaries are located in a variety of jurisdictions, the Company can give no assurances that our subsidiaries will not face transfer restrictions in the future due to regulatory or other reasons beyond our control.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $182.6 million, resulting from capital expenditures of $147.4 million and cash paid to acquire API Plastics of $82.3 million during the period, net of cash acquired (refer to Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Offsetting these uses of cash was an increase from proceeds received of $42.1 million from the sale of Sumika Styron Polycarbonate during the year.\nInterest Expense, Net\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company executed a repricing of our 2024 Term Loan B, thereby reducing the stated interest rate on this facility from the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 2.00% (subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor in both instances). At current LIBOR, the Company expects an aggregate cash interest savings from this repricing of $3.5 million annually.\nWe and our subsidiaries, affiliates, or significant shareholders may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nLoss on extinguishment of long-term debt was $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which related to the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017. This amount was comprised of a $53.0 million call premium paid to retire the Company's 2022 Senior Notes and a $11.5 million write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to these notes, as well as the write-off of $0.8 million of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount related to the termination of the Company's 2021 Term Loan B.\nLoss on extinguishment of long-term debt was $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which related to the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017. This amount was comprised of a $53.0 million call premium paid to retire the Company's 2022 Senior Notes and a $11.5 million write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to these notes, as well as the write-off of $0.8 million of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount related to the termination of the Company's 2021 Term Loan B.\n (3) Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2018. The amounts above include estimated interest on the 2024 Term Loan B and the related effects of interest rate swap agreements, as well as interest on the 2025 Senior Notes; however, they do not include the impacts of certain fixed-for-fixed cross currency swaps. Interest on the 2024 Term Loan B is payable quarterly and interest on the 2025 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on each May 3 and November 3. Refer to\nThe decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest rates from the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017 as well as lower deferred financing fee amortization recorded into interest expense from our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nGross Profit\nOf the 11% increase in net sales, 4% was due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period and 3% was due to higher sales volume, mainly from the Company's ABS expansion in China. Additionally, 2% of the net sales increase was due to price increases, mainly from higher polycarbonate prices, and 2% of the increase was due to increased volumes from the acquisition of API Plastics.\nOur 2025 Senior Notes issued in August 2017 under the Indenture include $500.0 million aggregate principal\nOther Expense (Income), net\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nForeign Exchange Forward Contracts\n\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $118.7 million, primarily resulting from capital expenditures of $121.4 million. This was partially offset by proceeds received of $1.7 million from the sale of businesses and other assets, primarily comprised of $1.3 million received as a prepayment in connection with the Company's preliminary agreement for the sale of certain land in Livorno, Italy, as described further in Note 20 within the consolidated financial statements.\n2017 vs. 2016\nSynthetic Rubber, Performance Plastics, Polystyrene, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. Refer to Item 1 - Business for a description of our segments, including a detailed overview, products and end uses, and competition and customers.\nWe require cash principally for day-to-day operations, including the purchase of raw materials for production, to finance capital investments and other initiatives, to service our outstanding indebtedness, and to fund the return of capital to shareholders via dividend payments and ordinary share repurchases. Our sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and amounts available under the Senior Credit Facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility (discussed further below).\n (f) Other items for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily relate to advisory and professional fees incurred in conjunction with our initiative to transition business services from Dow, including certain administrative services such as accounts payable, logistics, and IT services, as well as fees incurred in conjunction with the 2024 Term Loan B repricing completed during the second quarter of 2018. Other items for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relate to a curtailment gain recorded on certain of the Company's pension plans in Europe, offset by fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's debt refinancing which was completed during the third quarter of 2017. Other items for the year ended December 31, 2016 include other income of $6.9 million from the effective settlement of certain value-added tax positions, offset by $2.5 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's secondary offerings completed during the year. \n (c) Restructuring and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily relate to employee termination benefit charges incurred in connection with restructuring in our Synthetic Rubber segment. A portion of the restructuring charges for 2018 and the majority of the restructuring and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 relate to decommissioning, contract termination, and employee termination benefit charges incurred in connection with the upgrade and replacement of our compounding facility in Terneuzen, The Netherlands as well as our decision to cease manufacturing activities at our latex binders manufacturing facility in Livorno, Italy. Restructuring and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 relate primarily to $20.0 million in charges incurred in connection with the Livorno, Italy action discussed above. The remaining restructuring charges for 2016 relate to the Company's decision to divest our operations in Brazil as well as the closure of our Allyn's Point latex binders manufacturing facility. Refer to Note 20 in the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding restructuring activities. \n2017 vs. 2016\nWe also continue to maintain our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility which, as a result of an amendment to this agreement executed during the third quarter of 2018, matures in September 2021. The borrowing capacity of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility remains $150.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility and the Company had accounts receivable available to support this facility in excess of our borrowing capacity, based on the pool of eligible accounts receivable.\nEquity earnings decreased in 2017, as equity earnings from Americas Styrenics decreased from $135.8 million in 2016 to $122.9 million in 2017, primarily due to the planned and extended first quarter styrene outage at its St. James, Louisiana facility, including lower margins on second quarter sales of styrene purchased during the outage. Additionally, equity earnings from Sumika Styron Polycarbonate decreased from $8.9 million in 2016 to $0.8 million in 2017, as the Company completed the sale of our 50% share in the entity to Sumitomo Chemical Company Limited in January 2017, and therefore did not have an ownership interest in the joint venture for the majority of the year ended December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n2018 vs. 2017\nDerivative Instruments\n\nThe 4% increase in net sales was primarily due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar in 2018. Overall, the impact of sales volumes was not significant, as increases in the Performance Plastics and Polystyrene segments were offset by decreases in the Feedstocks, Latex Binders, and Synthetic Rubber segments. Additionally, selling prices did not have a significant effect on net sales, as increases in the Performance Plastics, Polystyrene, and Feedstocks segments were fully offset by decreases in the Synthetic Rubber and Latex Binders segments.\nThe majority of the overall $27.6 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to unfavorable raw material timing resulting from a favorable impact in 2016 compared to an unfavorable impact in the 2017, which resulted in a 15% decrease due to lower margins. Higher fixed costs as well as sales volume mix resulted in a 10% decrease primarily from growth initiatives, including our SSBR capacity expansion and SSBR pilot plant development.\n2017 vs. 2016\nNote that the accelerated depreciation charges incurred as part of both the upgrade and replacement of the Company's compounding facility in Terneuzen, The Netherlands as well as the Allyn's Point shutdown are included within the Depreciation and amortization\u201d caption above, and therefore are not included as a separate adjustment within this caption.\nThe following table outlines our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the associated interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing fees and issuance discounts. Effective interest rates for the borrowings included in the table below exclude the impact of deferred financing fee amortization, certain other fees charged to interest expense (such as fees for unused commitment fees during the period), and the impacts of derivatives designated as hedging instruments.\nIn addition, the decrease in provision for income taxes was partially offset by the tax effect on the increase in income before income taxes, which increased from $405.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $411.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21.5 million, which primarily consisted of $13.7 million of income related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and a $9.3 million gain related to the sale of the Company's 50% share in Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in January 2017 (refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Additionally, net foreign exchange transaction gains for the period were $1.4 million, which included $20.6 million of foreign exchange transaction gains primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, offset by $19.2 million of losses from our foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these net gains was $1.2 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017.\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. Amounts we pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table:\nNet Investment Hedge\nInterest Rate Swaps\n\nAlso included in our Senior Credit Facility is our 2024 Term Loan B, which had original principal of $700.0 million, maturing in September 2024, requires scheduled quarterly payments in amounts equal to 0.25% of the original principal. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company executed a repricing of our 2024 Term Loan B, thereby reducing the stated interest rate on this facility from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 2.00% (subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor in both instances). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company made net payments of $7.0 million on the 2024 Term Loan B, with an additional $7.0 million of scheduled future payments classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\n2017 vs. 2016\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $391.3 million, inclusive of $120.0 million in dividends from Americas Styrenics, as well as dividends from Sumika Styron Polycarbonate, $8.9 million of which were classified as operating activities, with the remaining $0.9 million classified as investing activities. Refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $126.7 million, noting increases in accounts receivable of $51.8 million and inventories of $80.2 million, respectively. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the pass through of increased raw material prices to our customers while the increase in inventories was primarily a result of building inventories in advance of certain growth initiatives.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $247.6 million. This activity was primarily from $215.1 million of payments related to the repurchase of ordinary shares during the period and $27.3 million of dividends paid, as well as $5.0 million of principal payments related to our 2021 Term Loan B.\nThe 5% decrease in net sales was comprised of several mostly offsetting factors. Lower styrene related sales volume resulted in a 10% decrease, which was partially offset by a 2% increase due to higher prices and a 3% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\n (d) Acquisition transaction and integration costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 relate to advisory and professional fees incurred in conjunction with our acquisition of API Plastics, which closed in July 2017. Additionally, the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a non-cash fair value inventory adjustment incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of API Plastics. Refer to Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for further information. \nCost of Sales\nCapital Resources, Indebtedness and Liquidity\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $222.2 million. This activity was primarily due to $142.9 million of payments related to the repurchase of ordinary shares, $66.0 million of dividends paid, and $7.0 million of net principal payments related to our 2024 Term Loan B during the period. Additionally, net cash used in financing activities included $8.2 million of withholding taxes paid related to the vesting of certain RSUs during the period, partially offset by $2.8 million of proceeds received from the exercise of option awards.\nWe use Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to evaluate and discuss the Company's liquidity position and results. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operating activities, less capital expenditures. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides an indicator of the Company's ongoing ability to generate cash through core operations, as it excludes the cash impacts of various financing transactions as well as cash flows from business combinations that are not considered organic in nature. We also believe that Free Cash Flow provides management and investors with a useful analytical indicator of our ability to service our indebtedness, pay dividends (when declared), and meet our ongoing cash obligations.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measure, which we define as income from continuing operations before interest expense, net; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization expense; loss on extinguishment of long-term debt; asset impairment charges; gains or losses on the dispositions of businesses and assets; restructuring charges; acquisition related costs and other items. In doing so, we are providing management, investors, and credit rating agencies with an indicator of our ongoing performance and business trends, removing the impact of transactions and events that we would not consider a part of our core operations.\nSelected Segment Information\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.5 million, which included $7.3 million of expense related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost, $0.5 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the repricing of the Company's 2024 Term Loan B during the second quarter of 2018, and other miscellaneous expenses of $0.9 million. These expenses were partially offset by net foreign exchange transaction gains for the period of $5.2 million. Net foreign exchange transactions gains included $15.8 million of foreign exchange transaction losses primarily from the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, more than offset by $21.0 million of gains from our foreign exchange forward contracts.\nOf the 14% increase in net sales, 16% was due to higher selling prices due to the pass through of higher styrene costs to customers, partially offset by a 4% decrease due to lower sales volume in Asia, with an increased focus on higher margin business.\nThe following sections describe net sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Intersegment sales have been eliminated. Refer to Note 19 in the consolidated financial statements for a detailed definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of income before income taxes to segment Adjusted EBITDA.\n2018 Highlights\nFeedstocks Segment\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company realigned our organizational structure to reflect the new model under which the business is being managed and results are being reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker. The Company's reportable segments are as follows: Latex Binders,\nThe Company's ongoing business operations expose it to various risks, including fluctuating foreign exchange rates and interest rate risk. To manage this risk, the Company periodically enters into derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. A brief summary of these derivative financial instrument programs is described below; however, refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for further information. The Company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n\nThe $19.5 million, or 8%, increase in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) is due to several factors. Higher advisory and professional fees resulted in a $14.9 million increase in external spend, primarily related to fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's recently initiated project to complete the transition of business and technical services from Dow, as well as fees related to certain growth initiatives. Additionally, approximately $4.3 million of the increase was due to currency impacts on our euro-based expenses, as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar, with an additional $3.8 million of depreciation expense compared to the prior year. Also contributing to this increase was $1.3 million in additional restructuring charges incurred compared to the prior year (refer to Note 20 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction of\nOur ability to raise additional financing and our borrowing costs may be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.\nEffective April 1, 2018, in conjunction with the adoption of recently issued hedging accounting guidance, the Company elected as an accounting policy to re-designate the CCS as a net investment hedge (and any future similar hedges) under the spot method. As such, changes in the fair value of the CCS that are included in the assessment of effectiveness (changes due to spot foreign exchange rates) are recorded as cumulative foreign currency translation within AOCI, and will remain in AOCI until either the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. As an additional accounting policy election applied to similar hedges under this new standard, the initial value of any component excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in income using a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded component and amounts recognized in income under that systematic and rational method is recognized in AOCI. The Company has elected to amortize the initial excluded component value as a reduction of Interest expense, net\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the CCS. Additionally, the accrual of periodic USD and euro-denominated interest receipts and payments under the terms of the CCS will also be recognized within Interest expense, net\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nInvesting Activities\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $17.9 million, which primarily consisted of $7.4 million of expense related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and an impairment charge for the loss on sale of our latex binders and PC & Compounding businesses in Brazil of $15.1 million (refer to Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Additionally, net foreign exchange transaction losses for the period were $1.8 million, which included $5.5 million of foreign exchange transaction losses primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, offset by $3.7 million of gains from our foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these net losses was $6.4 million of other income, which primarily related to the effective settlement of certain value-added tax positions during the period.\nOf the 17% increase in net sales, 9% was due to higher selling prices, primarily due to the pass through of higher raw material costs to our customers. Additionally, 6% of the increase was due to increased volumes, primarily related to the ABS expansion in China, as well as higher sales in the automotive markets in all regions and in the consumer electronics market in Asia.\n2018 vs. 2017\nOf the 3% decrease in net sales, 2% was due to lower pricing from the pass through of lower raw material costs, as well as competitive market conditions, and 3% was due to lower sales volume, mainly to the European paper market. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 2% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\nThrough December 31, 2017, the Company operated under six reporting segments: Latex Binders, Synthetic Rubber, Performance Plastics, Basic Plastics, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company realigned our reporting segments to reflect the new model under which the business is being managed and results are being reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker.\nThe decrease in interest expense, net of $23.7 million was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest rates from the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017, coupled with the benefits received from the cross currency swaps that the Company entered in September 2017, which are recorded as a benefit within interest expense as a result of our adoption of new hedging accounting guidance during the second quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $6.3 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year. Of this decrease, 11% was due to lower margins and 3% was due to lower sales volume, both attributable primarily to weaker tire market conditions. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 5% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period, as well as a 2% increase due to fixed cost improvements.\nOf the 29% increase in net sales, 25% was due to higher selling prices, primarily resulting from the pass through of higher butadiene and styrene costs to customers. Additionally, 3% of the increase was due to record sales volume which was a result of higher customer demand for SSBR, as well as higher sales of Ni-PBR.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $117.3 million, resulting from capital expenditures of $123.9 million during the period, a significant portion of which related to our project to upgrade our legacy ERP environment to the latest version of SAP. Partially offsetting these capital expenditures were $1.8 million in proceeds received from the sale of our businesses in Brazil and dividends received from Sumika Styron Polycarbonate during the period, $4.8 million of which were classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, with the remaining $1.4 million classified as operating activities.\nOf the 8% increase in cost of sales, 4% was due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar in 2018. Additionally, 3% of the increase was due to higher raw material costs, particularly styrene and BPA, as well as higher utility costs. Overall, the impact of sales volumes was not significant, as increases in the Performance Plastics and Polystyrene segments were offset by decreases within the Feedstocks, Latex Binders, and Synthetic Rubber segments.\nOther Expense (Income), net\nThe table below sets forth our historical results of operations, and these results as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. As a result of accounting guidance adopted in 2018 related to pension accounting, certain prior period financial information included in the sections below has been recast to conform to the current year presentation. Refer to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nSynthetic Rubber Segment\nSSBR Capacity Expansion and Pilot Plant\nNet Sales\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $1,192.4 million and $1,199.7 million, respectively, in outstanding indebtedness and $1,094.3 million and $1,019.6 million, respectively, in working capital. In addition, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $113.7 million and $128.3 million, respectively, of foreign cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets, outside of our country of domicile of Luxembourg, all of which is readily convertible into other foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar. Our intention is not to permanently reinvest our foreign cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly, we record deferred income tax liabilities related to the unremitted earnings of our subsidiaries. For a detailed description of the Company's debt structure, borrowing rates, and expected future payment obligations, refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThe $14.5 million, or 30%, decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower margins, mostly from weaker third quarter market conditions, as well as higher raw material costs, which resulted in a 51% decrease. Partially offsetting this decrease were fixed cost reductions, which resulted in a 9% increase in Adjusted EBITDA, and a 7% increase due to higher sales volumes in Europe and Asia. Additionally, there was a 6% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\nOf the 20% increase, 18% was due to higher selling prices primarily from the pass through of higher raw material costs, including higher styrene and butadiene costs to customers across our segments. Additionally, 1% of the increase was due to slightly higher sales volume, as increases due to Performance Plastics, Feedstocks, and Synthetic Rubber sales volume were partially offset by decreases from Latex Binders and Polystyrene sales volume.\nPerformance Plastics Segment\nCost of Sales\n2018 vs. 2017\nAmericas Styrenics Segment\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe increase in equity earnings of $20.4 million resulted from higher equity earnings from Americas Styrenics, primarily due to the impact from an extended prior year styrene outage at its St. James, Louisiana facility.\nPrior period financial information included within this Annual Report has been recast from its previous presentation to reflect the Company's new organizational structure.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net income of $292.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $573.2 million. Trinseo noted strong performance for much of 2018. However, we finished 2018 with lower than anticipated profitability due to challenging market dynamics and economic conditions toward the end of the year, particularly in November and December. Despite this, the Company delivered strong cash generation throughout 2018 and returned significant cash to our shareholders, purchasing approximately 2.2 million ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of $142.9 million and declaring quarterly dividends for an aggregate value of $1.56 per ordinary share, or $67.2\nThe $0.3 million year-over-year increase is comprised of several offsetting factors. There were increased costs incurred supporting growth initiatives of approximately $5.0 million, transaction and integration related costs of $3.4 million related to the API Plastics acquisition, and $3.6 million of asset impairment charges on certain long-lived assets within the Performance Plastics segment. Additionally, there was an increase of $2.8 million year-over-year attributable to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income in 2016. Offsetting the above increases in expenses was a decrease in restructuring expenses by $15.9 million, noting $19.9 million in asset impairment and other charges recorded in 2016 as a result of our decision to cease manufacturing operations at our latex facility in Livorno, Italy, partially offset by $3.3 million in charges in 2017 related to the upgrade and replacement of the Company's compounding facility in Terneuzen, The Netherlands as well as an additional $3.1 million of charges related to the Livorno, Italy action discussed above and further described within Note 20 in the consolidated financial statements. We also recorded a $3.1 million curtailment gain in 2017 on certain of the Company's pension plans in Europe, which further offset the increases in expenses.\nNet sales decreased 2% from the prior year, primarily due to the pass through of lower butadiene cost, which resulted in a 6% decrease, as well as a 2% decrease due to lower sales volume due to weaker tire market conditions. These decreases were partially offset by a 6% increase due to currency impacts as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFree Cash Flow is not intended to represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, and therefore, should not be used as an alternative for that measure. Other companies in our industry may define Free Cash Flow differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use this or similarly-named financial measures that other companies may use, to compare the liquidity and cash generation of those companies to our own. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation to cash provided by operating activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\n (e) Asset impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 relate to the impairment of certain corporate long-lived assets and certain long-lived assets within the Company's Performance Plastics segment, respectively. \nFree Cash Flow\nOur Senior Credit Facility includes the 2022 Revolving Facility, which matures in September 2022 and has a borrowing capacity of $375.0 million. As of December 31, 2018 the Company had no outstanding borrowings, and had $360.7 million (net of $14.3 million outstanding letters of credit) of funds available for borrowing under this facility. Further, as of December 31, 2018, the Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee in respect of any unused commitments under the 2022 Revolving Facility equal to 0.375% per annum.\n\nThe table below summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. We have derived the summarized cash flow information from our audited financial statements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $403.7 million, primarily due to improved net income for the period. Also impacting cash flow from operating activities for the period was $130.0 million in dividends from Americas Styrenics. Net cash used in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $69.8 million, noting increases in accounts receivable of $96.4 million and inventories of $51.0 million, respectively, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $57.1 million. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales and lower collections, due to timing, during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in inventory was primarily due to increases in raw material prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities was primarily due to increases in raw material prices, as noted above, as well as timing of vendor payments.\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our Company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6 - Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, included elsewhere within this Annual Report. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and all other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements and are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management and are made as of the date of this Annual Report. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere within this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d Definitions of capitalized terms not defined herein appear in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $1.3 million, or 1%, due to several factors. Higher fixed costs resulted in a 6% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. An additional 3% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was due to margin compression from end market mix in ABS, which was partially offset by margin expansion in PC. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 10% increase in Adjusted EBITDA due to increased sales volumes from the ABS expansion in China as well as from the automotive markets in all regions and in the consumer electronics market in Asia. Additionally, 2% of the decrease was due to the net impact of the Company's acquisition of API Plastics in 2017 and the sales of our joint venture Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in 2017 and our business in Brazil in 2016.\n\nThe Company also enters into forward contracts with the objective of managing the currency risk associated with forecasted U.S. dollar-denominated raw materials purchases by one of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro. By entering into these forward contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges, the Company buys a designated amount of U.S. dollars and sells euros at the prevailing market rate to mitigate the risk associated with the fluctuations in the euro-to-U.S. dollar foreign currency exchange rate.\n2017 vs. 2016\n\nFinancing Activities\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016\nOutlook\nOperating Activities\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest payments associated with the Company's variable rate debt. Under these interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as cash flow hedges, the Company is effectively converting a portion of our variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates.\n2018 vs. 2017\nProvision for Income Taxes\nCertain subsidiaries have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies, which creates foreign exchange risk. Our principal strategy in managing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to naturally hedge the foreign currency-denominated liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets against corresponding assets of the same currency such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in exchange rates are offset by changes in their corresponding foreign currency assets. In order to further reduce our exposure, the Company also uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on our assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies. These derivative contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.\nCash Flows\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOf the 19% increase in net sales, 25% was due to higher selling prices, primarily due to the pass through of higher butadiene and styrene costs to our customers. Offsetting this increase was a 4% decrease due to lower sales volume and a 3% decrease due to the net impact of the Company's acquisition of API Plastics in 2017 and the sales of our joint venture Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in 2017 and our business in Brazil in 2016.\nOn December 11, 2018, the Company announced that our President and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher D. Pappas, intended to retire in 2019. On January 30, 2019, the Company named Frank A. Bozich the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, effective March 4, 2019, at which time Mr. Pappas will assume the role of Special Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer in order to support Mr. Bozich's transition.\nLatex Binders Segment\n*The results of this segment are comprised entirely of earnings from Americas Styrenics, our equity method investment. As such, Adjusted EBITDA related to this segment is included within Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Senior Credit Facility and Indenture also limit the ability of the Borrowers and Issuers, respectively, to pay dividends or make other distributions to Trinseo S.A., which could then be used to make distributions to shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company declared total dividends of $1.56 per ordinary share, or $67.2 million, of which $18.2 million remains accrued as of December 31, 2018 and the majority of which will be paid in January 2019. These dividends are well within the available capacity under the terms of the restrictive covenants contained in the Senior Credit Facility and Indenture. Further, significant additional capacity continues to be available under the terms of these covenants to support expected future dividends to shareholders, should the Company continue to declare them.\n2017 vs. 2016\nTerm Loan Repricing\nThe decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 million, or 3%, was mainly due to a decline in margin, which resulted in a 14% decrease. Higher styrene margins over raw materials in Europe and Asia were more than offset by the impact of raw material timing, particularly with declining benzene costs in the fourth quarter. This decrease was partially offset by an 8% increase due to currency impacts, as the euro strengthened in comparison to the U.S. dollar during the period, as well as a 3% increase due to fixed costs improvements.\nNew Segmentation\nPolystyrene Segment\nNet Sales\n\n businesses. In 2018, these amounts related to consideration earned for the subsequent performance of our former latex business. For 2016, these amounts reflect the impairment changes recorded for the original loss on sale of this operating entity in Brazil. Net gain on disposition of businesses and assets during the year ended December 31, 2017 relates primarily to the sale of our 50% share in Sumika Styron Polycarbonate to Sumitomo Chemical Company Limited, for which the Company recorded a gain on sale of $9.3 million during the period. Refer to Note 4 and Note 5, respectively, in the consolidated financial statements for further information. \nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21.5 million, which primarily consisted of $13.7 million of income related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and a $9.3 million gain related to the sale of the Company's 50% share in Sumika Styron Polycarbonate in January 2017 (refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information). Additionally, net foreign exchange transaction gains for the period were $1.4 million, which included $20.6 million of foreign exchange transaction gains primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated payables due to the relative changes in rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period, offset by $19.2 million of losses from our foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these net gains was $1.2 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the Company's debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2017.\nThe year-over-year 8% increase was primarily attributable to higher margins per unit sold, especially within Latex Binders and Feedstocks, due to more favorable market conditions. Higher sales volume in Performance Plastics and Synthetic Rubber was partially offset by lower sales volume in Latex Binders and Polystyrene, as well as margin compression in Performance Plastics, due to end market mix, and in Synthetic Rubber, due to unfavorable raw material timing impacts.\nThe Company's cash flow generation in recent years has been strong, as discussed above. We believe that funds provided by operations, our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and borrowings available under our 2022 Revolving Facility and our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility will be adequate to meet planned operating and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months under current operating conditions. Nevertheless, our ability to generate future cash and to pay our indebtedness and fund other liquidation needs is subject to certain risks described under Item 1A - Risk Factors. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were in compliance with all the covenants and default provisions under our debt agreements. Refer to Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for further information on the details of the covenant requirements.\nAs noted above, we finished 2018 with lower than anticipated profitability due to challenging market dynamics and economic conditions, including weak demand in China across a number of end markets, customer destocking due to rapidly falling feedstock prices, and weak automotive and tire markets. These dynamics intensified in late November through December 2018. We expect the unfavorable market conditions that affected the latter part of 2018 to continue impacting our business in the first quarter of 2019, but with signs of market improvement across many product areas. Our results for 2019 will depend largely on the timing of market recovery in these areas. Regardless of the timing of market recovery, Trinseo remains committed to optimizing business performance, generating strong cash flow, and returning cash to shareholders.\n2018 vs. 2017\nThe 17% increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an extended production outage in 2017 at the Americas Styrenics' St. James, Louisiana facility, described more fully below.\napproximately $2.0 million in employee incentive compensation and other personnel costs, as well as a $2.8 million reduction in asset-related impairment charges.\nThe 9% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the planned first quarter of 2017 styrene outage at the Americas Styrenics' St. James, Louisiana facility, which was extended in order to complete repairs on critical equipment. The facility came back online at full production in early April 2017. As a result of this extended outage, the Company incurred an unfavorable impact of approximately $23 million to Adjusted EBITDA, of which approximately $15 million was related to lost production margin and the remaining was related to sales of excess spot styrene following the outage. Partially offsetting the impact of this outage was an increase in Adjusted EBITDA due to higher styrene sales volume, including impacts from a stronger export market.\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\nOf the 22% increase, 19% was attributable to higher prices for raw materials, primarily related to styrene monomer and butadiene, and an additional 1% of the increase was due to increased sales volume, primarily in Performance Plastics and Synthetic Rubber. Partially offsetting these increases was a 1% decrease related to a curtailment gain recorded in 2017 as a result of changes to certain of the Company's pension plans in Europe.\n (a) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we refer to in making operating decisions because we believe it provides our management as well as our investors and credit agencies with meaningful information regarding the Company's operational performance. We believe the use of EBITDA as a metric assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis. Other companies in our industry may define EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use EBITDA, or similarly-named financial measures that other companies may use, to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of our EBITDA results to our net income, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. \n (2) The long-term indebtedness line in the table includes obligations on our outstanding borrowing amounts as of December 31, 2018, which are related to the 2024 Term Loan B and the 2025 Senior Notes. The impacts of certain fixed-for-fixed cross currency swaps, which are discussed in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, as well as all other debt outstanding as of December 31, 2018 totaling $1.1 million are not included in this line. \nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $4.1 million, or 8%, primarily due to a 6% decrease from lower sales volumes, particularly in Asia, as well as a 4% decrease due to lower margins in Europe, which were impacted by higher raw material costs. Partially offsetting these decreases was a 3% increase due to lower fixed costs.\nThe 38% increase in net sales was mainly due to the pass through of higher styrene prices, which contributed to 27% of the increase. Higher styrene-related sales volume also resulted in a 10% increase in net sales.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed the initial phase of the 50 KT SSBR capacity expansion at the Schkopau, Germany facility, and also opened a new SSBR pilot plant at this same facility which will expedite the product development process from lab sample to commercialization by delivering sufficient quantities of new formulations without the need to interrupt production in our industrial lines.\nChief Executive Officer Transition\nThe Company adopted new hedge accounting guidance effective April 1, 2018, the impacts of which are discussed below. Refer to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further information on the new accounting guidance.\n2017 vs. 2016\nForeign Exchange Cash Flow Hedges\nRefer to the discussion above for significant impacts to cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThere are limitations to using the financial performance measures such as Adjusted EBITDA. This performance measure is not intended to represent net income or other measures of financial performance. As such, it should not be used as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance. Other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use this or similarly-named financial measures that other companies may use, to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this performance measure to our net income, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).\nGross Profit", "item_7_tables": "Table 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2018 by $28.1 million (20%) and $4.1 million (8%) compared to 2017 and 2016 respectively, mainly due to lower margins from raw material impacts and competitive conditions.\n\n2. Net sales increased by 4% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily from currency impacts as the Euro strengthened. Sales volumes were flat as increases in some segments were offset by decreases in others. \n\n3. Gross profit decreased by 17% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to weaker results in several segments from lower margins and sales volumes.\n\n4. Net income decreased to $292.5 million in 2018 from $328.3 million in 2017. This was partly due to lower operating income and higher interest expense.\n\n5. The company realigned its segment reporting structure effective January 1, 2018 into 6 segments. It previously had reported under 5 segments.\n\n6. Challenging market conditions impacted profitability later in 2018, especially in November and December. The company expects these conditions to continue into early 2019 before recovering.\n\nIn summary, the company faced headwinds in 2018 from unfavorable market dynamics, resulting in decreased profitability. It continues to generate strong cash flow and remains committed to optimizing performance and returning cash to shareholders."}
