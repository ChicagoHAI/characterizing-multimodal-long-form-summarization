Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REVIEW\nThe following management discussion and analysis addresses important factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the periods indicated. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with this review.\nOverview\nSince our inception in 1973, we have pursued managed profitable growth through providing quality financial services. Our overall focus is on building shareholder value. Our mission is to continue growth, improve earnings and increase shareholder value; to treat customers, employees, community and shareholders according to the \"Golden Rule\"; and to operate within a culture of strong internal controls.\nOur franchise primarily spans the metropolitan Atlanta, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tallahassee and Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida markets. We provide banking services and Wealth Management services and credit-related insurance products through branches in Georgia and Florida, and an insurance office in Atlanta, Georgia. Indirect auto loans are provided in Georgia and Florida and mortgage loans are provided throughout the South, while SBA loans are originated nationwide.\nWe have continued to focus on organic growth and building meaningful presence and relationships in Georgia and northern, eastern and central Florida. We believe our retail branch network positions us to generate new customers and business opportunities.\nWealth Management began operations in July 2014 when we began offering trust services. We expanded our services and team in 2017 with the addition of client advisors. The Wealth Management division provides trust administration, investment management, financial and estate planning, specialized lending and banking for affluent and high net worth individuals.\nOur lending activities are significantly influenced by the local economic environments in the markets we serve. We have grown our consumer installment, mortgage, construction and commercial loan portfolios organically and through acquisitions as the economy continues to improve. Our loan portfolio is well diversified among consumer, business, and real estate lending. The credit quality of the loans we have originated continues to be strong.\nFinancial Performance\nWe recorded net income of $43.8 million in 2018 compared to $39.8 million in 2017, an increase of $4.0 million, or 10.1%. Both net income per basic and diluted common share were $1.61 for 2018, and $1.50 and $1.49, respectively, for 2017. An increase of $14.3 million, or 10.6%, in net interest income, an increase in noninterest income of $3.9 million or 2.9% and a decrease in income tax expense of $1.5 million or 9.8%, were partially offset by an increase of $14.4 million, or 6.8%, in noninterest expense and an increase of $1.2 million or 29.1% in the provision for loan losses.\nIncome tax expense was $1.5 million, or 9.8%, lower in 2018 than in 2017, as a result of the rate change following the enactment on December 22, 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent as of the beginning of the tax year 2018.\nWe derive approximately 48% of our revenues from noninterest income sources such as service charges on loan and deposit accounts, fees from other products and services and income from mortgage banking, indirect automobile lending, and SBA lending activities. The majority of the noninterest income earned from these sources is generated from gains on sales of loans including recognition of loan servicing revenue as the majority of loans are sold. The retained servicing obligation generates servicing revenue over the life of the loans sold. The revenue generated from gains on sales of loans and related servicing is partially offset by amortization and possible impairment of the related servicing rights. Servicing rights are amortized in proportion to the estimated future servicing income on the underlying loans sold. Impairment on servicing rights is recorded based on changes in the estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses on the underlying loans sold.\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\nWe continue to attract new customer relationships, and talented and experienced bankers to support our growth. We are also continuing to focus on asset quality, revenue growth, deposit growth and quality loan growth at a well-maintained capital level.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions, and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies, or conditions significantly different from certain assumptions, could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d Significant accounting policies have been periodically discussed and reviewed with and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors.\nThe following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on management's estimates, assumptions, and judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, including loan portfolio concentrations, current economic conditions, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance.\nA formal review of the allowance for loan losses is prepared quarterly to assess the probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. For purposes of management's review, the loan portfolio is separated by loan type. The level of allowance required for each loan type is determined based upon historical charge-off experience and current internal and external qualitative factors. Acquired purchased credit-impaired (\"PCI\") loans are evaluated for impairment each quarter and if a pool is impaired, an allowance for loan loss is recorded.\nIn addition to homogeneous pools of loans, every commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loan is assigned a risk rating using established credit policy guidelines. All nonperforming commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loans and loans deemed to have greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed monthly by our Credit Review Department to determine the level of additional allowance for loan losses, if any, required to be specifically assigned to these loans.\nAcquisition Accounting\nWe have accounted for our acquisitions as business combinations. As such, the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, as well as for specific disclosures. The calculation of fair value of loans and foreclosed property acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than for the remainder of acquired assets or assumed liabilities.\nDetermining the fair value of assets and liabilities, particularly illiquid assets and liabilities, is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair value. Information regarding our loan discount and core deposit intangible asset may be adjusted as we refine our estimates. Purchase price allocations on completed acquisitions may be modified through the measurement date which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date. If we recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period, the amounts will be reported in the period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Fair value adjustments based on updated estimates could materially affect the goodwill, if any, recorded on the acquisition.\nWe segregate loans acquired between loans for which there was a discount related, in part, to credit and loans for which there was not a material discount attributable to credit. Subsequent to the acquisition date, decreases in expected cash flows compared to initial estimates on the loans for which there was a credit discount are recognized as impairment through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in cash flows (in a loan pool where an allowance for loan losses on acquired loans was previously recorded) reduces the remaining allowance for loan losses on acquired loans before recalculating the amount of accretable yield percentage to be used going forward for the loan pool.\nWe account for the discount on loans which do not have a discount materially attributable to credit or revolving type loans by accreting the discount on each individual loan over time using a level yield approach based on the contractual cash flows for term loans or on a straight-line basis for revolving loans. The methodology also considers the remaining fair value discounts recognized upon acquisition associated with purchased non-impaired loans in estimating a general allowance and also includes establishing an ALL for purchased credit-impaired loans that have deteriorated in credit quality since acquisition.\nThe credit risks inherent and evidenced in our acquisitions have resulted in a portion of the loans purchased in those transactions having a credit discount. On the date of acquisition, when the loans had evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and we believed it was probable that we would not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, we refer to the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected as the non-accretable\ndiscount. We estimate expected cash flows at each future reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows generally result in a provision for loan losses, net of any amounts due from the FDIC under the applicable loss share agreement. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable discount, which has a positive effect on interest income. We have recorded acquired loans at fair value, exclusive of any amounts due from the FDIC under applicable loss share agreements.\nBecause we record acquired loans at fair value, we recorded no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans on the acquisition date, given that the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value estimates associated with the acquired loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nOther Real Estate ( ORE\u201d)\nORE, consisting of properties obtained through acquisition, foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans, is initially reported at fair value, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Management also considers other factors, including changed economic conditions since the last appraisal, changes in absorption rates, stale appraisals or imprecision and subjectivity of the appraisal process, length of time the property has been on the market and anticipated sales values, which have resulted in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in certain appraisals.\nSignificant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of ORE. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of ORE. The period of time within which such estimates can be considered current may be significantly shortened during periods of market volatility.\nAt the time of acquisition, foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the allowance for loan losses. After the transfer to ORE, the fair value, less estimated selling costs, becomes the new cost basis for the ORE. Subsequent declines in the fair value of ORE, below the new cost basis are recognized by a charge to income.\nManagement reviews the value of ORE on at least a quarterly basis and adjusts the values as appropriate. Generally, a new appraisal is received annually on each ORE property. Any subsequent adjustments to reflect changes in fair value and selling costs are recorded as a component of other noninterest expense or a reduction of any existing valuation allowance on a property by property basis, but not below zero. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy.\nRevenue from ORE operations as well as gains or losses on sales is recorded as a component of noninterest income. Expenses from ORE operations are recorded as a component of noninterest expense.\nValuation of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Purchase Accounting Adjustments\nWe account for our acquisitions as business combinations, which require the use of the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values, which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques. The determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective, as is the appropriate amortization method for such intangible assets.\nThe acquisition of AEB in March 2016 resulted in the recording of $5.2 million in goodwill. We review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\nFor our annual goodwill impairment evaluation, management bypassed the qualitative assessment for each respective reporting unit and performed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Accordingly, we determined the fair value of our reporting unit and compared the fair value to the reporting unit's carrying amount. We determined that our reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying amount; therefore, we concluded our goodwill was not impaired. No events have occurred since the last annual goodwill impairment assessment that would necessitate an interim goodwill impairment assessment. For additional information on goodwill, see Note 2: Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements.\nCapitalized Servicing Assets and Liabilities\nWe sell indirect automobile loan pools, residential mortgages and SBA loans with servicing retained. When the contractual servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. When the expected costs to a servicer for performing loan servicing are not expected to adequately compensate a servicer, a capitalized servicing liability is recognized. Servicing assets and servicing\nliabilities are amortized over the expected lives of the serviced loans utilizing the interest method. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received.\nNo less frequently than quarterly, management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file a consolidated federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in several states. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The net deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting period to assess the probability of realization of benefits in future periods and whether valuation allowances are appropriate. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. As the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, we remeasured our net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent from the beginning of the tax year 2018. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is more likely than not\u201d that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. Management has reviewed all evidence, both positive and negative, and concluded that a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset is not needed at December 31, 2018. The calculation of the income tax provision is complex and requires the use of judgments and estimates in its determination.\nFair Value\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). A financial instrument's level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe primary financial instruments we carry at fair value are investment securities, interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans ( IRLCs\u201d), derivative instruments, and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. We also carry certain impaired loans, foreclosed assets and capitalized servicing rights on residential mortgage and SBA loans at fair value.\nInvestment securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, we obtain fair value measurements from an independent third party pricing service. We have processes in place to evaluate such third party pricing services to ensure information obtained and valuation techniques are appropriate. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond's terms and conditions, among other things. The investments in our portfolio are generally not quoted on an exchange but are actively traded in the secondary institutional markets.\nWe classify IRLCs on residential mortgage loans held for sale on a gross basis within other liabilities or other assets. The fair value of these commitments, while based on interest rates observable in the market, is highly dependent on the ultimate closing of the loans. These pull-through\u201d rates are based on both our historical data and the current interest rate environment and reflect our best estimate of the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan. The loan servicing value is also included in the fair value of the IRLCs. Because these inputs are not transparent in market trades, we consider IRLCs to be Level 3 assets.\nDerivative instruments are primarily transacted in the secondary mortgage and institutional dealer markets and priced with observable market assumptions at a mid-market valuation point, with appropriate valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risk. For purposes of valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, we evaluate liquidity premiums that may be demanded by market participants, as well as the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit if applicable. To date, no material losses due to a counterparty's inability to pay any net uncollateralized position have occurred. Derivative instruments are considered to be Level 3.\nThe credit risk associated with the underlying cash flows of instruments carried at fair value was a consideration in estimating the fair value of certain financial instruments. Credit risk was considered in the valuation through a variety of inputs, as applicable, including, the actual default and loss severity of the collateral, and level of subordination. The assumptions used to estimate credit risk incorporated relevant information that a market participant would likely use in valuing an instrument. Because mortgage loans held-for-sale are sold within a few weeks of origination, they are unlikely to demonstrate any of the credit weaknesses discussed above and as a result, there have been no credit related adjustments to fair value.\nThe fair value of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include market trade pricing from brokers and investors and the mortgage-backed security markets. As such, we classify these loans as Level 2.\nSBA and indirect loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is based on recent trades for similar loan pools as well as offering prices for similar assets provided by buyers in the secondary market. If the cost of a loan is determined to be less than the fair value of similar loans, the impairment is recorded by the establishment of a reserve to reduce the value of the loan.\nImpaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired, at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs. A loan is considered impaired if it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due according to the terms of the loan agreement. Measuring the impairment of loans using the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, is not considered a fair value measurement. For collateral-dependent loans, fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans and is classified as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may include real estate or business assets, including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. The value of real estate collateral is determined based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers ordered by our internal appraisal department, which is independent of our lending function. If significant, the value of business equipment is based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers ordered by our internal appraisal department; otherwise, the equipment's net book value on the business's financial statements is the basis for the value of business equipment. Inventory and accounts receivable collateral are valued based on independent field examiner review or aging reports. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.\nForeclosed assets are adjusted to fair value less estimated selling costs upon transfer of the loans to ORE, which becomes the new carrying value of the ORE. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral, sales agreements, or management's estimation of the value of the collateral using market data including recent sales activity for similar assets in the property's market. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 3. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the property. Management continues to evaluate the appropriateness of appraised values on at least an annual basis.\nServicing assets and servicing liabilities are initially recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value when loans are sold with servicing retained with the income statement effect recorded in gains on sales of loans. In evaluating servicing rights and estimating the fair value of the underlying loan pools based on the present value of net future cash flows, we use a number of assumptions and estimates including: prepayment speeds, discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, potential credit losses, and comparable assumptions used by market participants to value and bid servicing rights available for sale in the market. When the contractually specified servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. When the expected income to a servicer for performing loan servicing is not expected to adequately compensate a servicer, a capitalized servicing liability is recognized.\nServicing rights are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Servicing fee income, net of amortization of servicing rights, is reported as part of noninterest income from mortgage banking activities, indirect lending activities, and SBA lending activities, as applicable, in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nServicing rights are tested for impairment on at least a quarterly basis based on fair value. Management uses a model operated and maintained by an independent third party to assist in determining fair value which stratifies the servicing portfolio into homogeneous subsets with unique behavior characteristics. The model then converts those characteristics into income and expense streams, adjusts those streams for prepayments, present values the adjusted streams, and combines the present values into a total. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, prepayment speeds, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold servicing retained, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received. Management periodically obtains an independent review of the valuation assumptions to validate the fair value estimate and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in measuring fair value.\nThe fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. If the cost basis of any loan stratification tranche is higher than the present value of the tranche, an impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance which reduces servicing rights on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and reduces noninterest income from mortgage banking activities, indirect lending activities, and SBA lending activities, as applicable, in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNo less frequently than quarterly, management reviews the status of mortgage loans held-for-sale for which fair value has been elected and pools of servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets results in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nThe significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our IRLCs is the pull-through ratio, which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. Generally, the fair value of an IRLC is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the IRLC rate. Therefore, an increase in the pull-through ratio (i.e., higher percentage of loans are estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the IRLC increasing if in a gain position, or decreasing if in a loss position. The pull-through ratio is largely dependent on the processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. The pull-through ratio is computed by the secondary marketing department using historical data and the ratio is reviewed by the Secondary Marketing Department of the Mortgage Banking Division for reasonableness.\nForward commitments are instruments that are used to hedge the value of the IRLC's and mortgage loans held-for-sale. We take investor commitments to sell a loan or pool of newly originated loans to an investor for an agreed upon price for delivery in the future. This type of forward commitment is also known as a mandatory commitment. Generally, the fair value of a forward is negative (positive) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the current commitment interest rate. The value of these commitments is ultimately determined by the investor that sold the commitment and represents a significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our forward commitments.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to traditional measures, management provides information it considers useful to investors in understanding the Company's operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of its peers. Management also uses these measures internally to assess and better understand the Company's underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators used by the Company may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and performance indicators used by other financial institutions to assess their performance and trends.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures frequently are used by shareholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. We encourage readers to consider the Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nIn particular, management uses tangible shareholders' equity, adjusted allowance for loan losses, adjusted nonperforming assets, adjusted nonperforming loans, adjusted total loans, and related ratios, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses (i) tangible shareholders' equity (which exclude goodwill and other intangibles from equity) and related ratios to evaluate the adequacy of shareholders' equity and to facilitate comparisons with peers; and (ii) adjusted allowance for loan losses (which includes adjustments related to acquired loans and indirect auto loans), adjusted non-performing assets and adjusted loans (which includes adjustments for repurchased government-guaranteed loans, SBA guaranteed loans and acquired loans) as supplemental information to evaluate both asset quality and asset quality trends, and to facilitate comparisons with peers. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP finance measures to their nearest GAAP measure appears in the following table:\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td>

Compared to 2017\nNet Income\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $43.8 million and we reported $1.61 for the basic and fully diluted earnings per share. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $39.8 million and we reported basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.50 and $1.49, respectively. The $4.0 million increase in net income in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of $14.3 million, and increase in noninterest income of $3.9 million; offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $14.4 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $149.7 million in 2018 compared to $135.5 million in 2017, an increase of $14.2 million, or 10.5%. Average interest-earning assets in 2018 increased by $270.4 million to $4.4 billion, a 6.5% increase, when compared to 2017. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $96.8 million to $3.1 billion, a 3.2% increase. The net interest margin increased by 12 basis points to 3.38% in 2018 when compared to 2017. The primary components of our net interest income and margin are described below.\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $23.4 million for 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in our interest income primarily occurred due to the net growth of $270.4 million, or 6.5%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio, as well as an increase in yield on loans of 21 basis points, primarily in the commercial, construction, and mortgage loan portfolios, including an increase of 3 basis points attributable to accretable yield.\nThe average balance of loans outstanding in 2018 increased by $324.7 million, or 8.7%, to $4.1 billion when compared to 2017 as the number of loan originations increased, particularly commercial, construction and mortgage loans. The average balance of investments also increased by $41.9 million as the Bank continues to increase its investments available-for-sale portfolio as part of its strategy to reposition the balance sheet to higher yielding assets, and reduce its reliance on \"gain on sale\" income. The yield on interest-earning assets in 2018 reflected a 30 basis point increase as compared to 2017, as interest rates rose over the year.\nInterest expense in 2018 increased by $9.2 million, or 40.3%, to $31.9 million, primarily as the result of a $96.8 million, or 3.2%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances and a 27 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of $109.7 million, offset by a slight decrease in average deposits of $13.0 million.\nAverage Balances, Interest and Yields\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding (i) the total dollar amount of interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rate; (iii) net interest income; (iv) net interest spread; and (v) net interest margin. The average balances are principally daily averages, and, for loans, include both performing and non-performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion on acquired loans and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td>

Average loan volumes include nonperforming loans which result in the impact in the associated lost interest on nonaccrual loans being reflected in the average rate.\n(2) Reflects fully taxable equivalent adjustments using a Federal Tax rate of 21% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a 35% tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nManagement's policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries, net of amounts due from the FDIC under the loss sharing agreements for our past FDIC-assisted transactions. The provision for loan losses is subject to a quarterly review process which incorporates trends in factors such as historical credit losses, delinquencies, level of nonperforming loans, loan growth, composition of the loan portfolio, etc. combined with management's view on qualitative factors such as economic conditions, loan concentrations, etc.\nThe provision for loan losses was $5.5 million in 2018 and $4.3 million in 2017, an increase of $1.2 million or 29.1%, mainly due to increases in commercial loan balances. Net charge-offs were relatively flat at $4.1 million in 2018 and $4.2 million in 2017. Credit quality trend performance remains consistent and strong as net charge-offs were 0.11% of average loans for the year.\nAverage nonperforming assets were $74.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $56.9 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of $17.6 million, or 30.9%, primarily due to the increase in nonaccrual loans, particularly the increase in nonaccrual residential mortgage loans of $10.3 million. This increase was primarily due to repurchases of government guaranteed loans.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2018 and 2017 was 0.85% and 0.83%, respectively. The slight increase is mainly due to increases in provision for loan losses from increased commercial loan balances.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe following table outlines the

Net charge-offs decreased in the commercial and consumer portfolios, due to fewer charge-offs and/or higher recoveries in these portfolios than in the previous year. The decreases in net charge-offs in these portfolios were offset by higher charge-offs in the SBA and mortgage portfolios and lower recoveries in the construction portfolio.\nNoninterest Income\nThe categories of our noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other fees and charges\n</td> <td>9,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking activities\n</td> <td>103,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indirect lending activities\n</td> <td>5,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,306\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA lending activities\n</td> <td>6,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance\n</td> <td>4,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trust and wealth management fees\n</td> <td>2,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income for 2018 was $138.9 million compared to $135.0 million in 2017, a $3.9 million, or 2.9% increase. This increase was primarily a result of increases in mortgage banking, SBA lending activities, and bank-owned life insurance income, offset by a decrease in indirect lending, as noted below.\nNoninterest income from mortgage banking activities increased by $4.3 million, or 4.3%, to $103.1 million in 2018, compared to $98.8 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a MSR's valuation recovery of $4.7 million in 2018, as interest rates increased over the year. Mortgage loan production for the year increased from $2.8 billion in 2017 to $2.9 billion in 2018, a $120.5 million, or 4.3%, year over year change. Increased production led to an increase in the volume of residential mortgage loans sold from $2.6 billion in 2017 to $2.8 billion in 2018, a $164.9 million, or 6.4%, year over year change. Gain on sales of mortgage loans decreased by $8.0 million, or 10.4%, year over year, from $76.4 million in 2017 to $68.5 million in 2018. Decreased gains on mortgage loan sales were partially offset by an increase in mortgage servicing revenue $2.9 million, or 13.2%, to $25.1 million in 2018, compared to $22.2 million in 2017 as the portfolio of loans serviced for others grew by $390.4 million or 4.4%, in 2018.\nNoninterest income from indirect lending activities decreased by $7.3 million, or 58.3%, as indirect loan production decreased by $543.9 million, or 46.6%, in 2018 as compared to 2017, and indirect sales decreased by $297.3 million, or 69.0% leading to decreased gains on loan sales in 2018 as compared to 2017. Indirect servicing income decreased by $1.8 million to $7.4 million compared to prior year. The decrease in gains occurred due to the industry-wide weakening of the indirect auto loan sales market, as well as the Company exiting all markets except Georgia and Florida.\nNoninterest income from SBA lending activities increased by $2.2 million, or 48.2%, in 2018, to $5.2 million, compared to 2017 due to an increase of SBA loans sales by $19.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017, which resulted in higher gain on sales. SBA servicing income decreased by $298,000 in 2018 to $2.2 million compared to prior year.\nThe increase in revenue from other fees and charges of $1.1 million, or 13.3%, stems from an increase in customer accounts, particularly due to the successful marketing campaign in Florida and increasing revenue from debit card and ATM fees in 2018, as compared to 2017.\nBank owned life insurance income increased by $2.5 million compared to prior year primarily due to a non recurring $2.6 million death benefit received from cash surrender value life insurance policies in 2018.\nTrust and wealth management fees increased by $1.0 million to $2.3 million in 2018 compared to $1.3 million in prior year. We have expanded our Wealth Management business and team since 2017 with the addition of client advisors, and assets under management have continued to grow in 2018.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions\n</td> <td>36,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy\n</td> <td>18,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional and other services\n</td> <td>17,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>39,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense increased by $14.4 million, or 6.8%, in 2018 to $225.3 million compared to 2017, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, commissions, and other services.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased by $10.2 million, or 9.8%, in 2018, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries and employee benefits associated with employee incentives due to performance and related to the balance sheet strategies implemented earlier in the year, and from a comparison perspective, no executive incentives were paid in 2017.\nCommissions increased by $1.6 million in line with the increase in mortgage loan production, primarily due to the increase in mortgage originators and the impact of guaranteed commissions paid to new mortgage originators in expansion markets.\nOther operating expenses were $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $2.8 million, or 7.8%, increase compared to $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily related to $1.6 million increase in lending related expenses coupled with the recently announced merger related expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2018 and 2017, was $13.8 million and $15.3 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 23.9% and 27.7%, respectively. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, Fidelity remeasured its net deferred tax liability position to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This revaluation resulted in a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $4.9 million in 2017.\nExcluding the effects of the one-time tax benefit recorded to revalue the net deferred tax liability and the benefit of discrete items recorded for employee stock option exercises, the effective tax rate was 23.9% in 2018 compared to 38.2% in 2017.\nResults of Operations - 2017 Compared to 2016\nNet Income\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $39.8 million and reported basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.50 and $1.49, respectively. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $38.8 million and reported basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.52 and $1.50, respectively. The $1.0 million increase in net income in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to an increase in interest income of $8.7 million, a decrease in income tax expense of $6.9 million, and a decrease in provision for loan losses of $4.0 million; offset by a decrease in noninterest income of $6.4 million, an increase in noninterest expense of $9.9 million, and an increase in interest expense of $2.3 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $135.5 million in 2017 compared to $129.4 million in 2016, an increase of $6.1 million, or 4.7%. Average interest-earning assets in 2017 increased by $259.9 million to $4.2 billion, a 6.7% increase when compared to 2016. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $107.0 million to $3.0 billion, a 3.7% increase. The net interest margin decreased by 6 basis points to 3.26% in 2017 when compared to 2016. The primary components of our net interest income and margin are described below.\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $8.4 million for 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in our interest income primarily occurred due to the net growth of $259.9 million, or 6.7%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio, as well as an increase in yield on loans of 5 basis points, primarily in the commercial, construction, and mortgage loan portfolios, including an increase of 3 basis points attributable to accretable yield.\nThe average balance of loans outstanding in 2017 increased by $139.1 million, or 3.8%, to $3.8 billion when compared to 2016 as the number of loan originations increased, particularly commercial, construction and mortgage loans. The average balance of Fed funds sold and interest-bearing deposits also increased by $156.7 million or 165.2%, the result of an increase in cash from a successful Florida money market deposit campaign begun in late 2016. The yield on interest-earning assets in 2017 reflected a 4 basis point decrease as compared to 2016.\nInterest expense in 2017 increased by $2.3 million, or 11.2%, to $22.7 million, primarily as the result of a $107.0 million, or 3.7%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances and, to a lesser degree, a 5 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for 2017 was primarily due to the growth in interest bearing demand and money market deposits of $257.7 million as Fidelity had a successful advertising campaign in Florida during 2017 to attract new demand and money market deposits.\nThe increase in interest expense in 2017 was primarily attributable to average interest-bearing deposits, which increased by $235.2 million, or 9.3%, to $2.8 billion during 2017 compared to 2016, while average borrowings decreased by $128.1 million, or 33.4%, to $254.9 million. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an increase of $257.7 million in interest-bearing money market and demand deposits as mentioned above.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was $4.3 million in 2017 and $8.2 million in 2016. Net charge-offs were flat at $4.2 million in 2017 and in 2016. The decrease in the provision in 2017, compared to 2016 was primarily due to continued improvement in asset quality in 2017.\nAverage nonperforming assets were $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $62.0 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $5.1 million or 8.3%.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2017 and 2016 was 0.83% and 0.90%, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding, excluding acquired loans, at the end of 2017 and 2016 was 0.88% and 0.99%, respectively. The improvement in asset quality over the past several years has offset the need for a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans as a result of loan growth in 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nThe categories of noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other fees and charges\n</td> <td>8,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking activities\n</td> <td>98,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,780\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indirect lending activities\n</td> <td>12,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,367\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA lending activities\n</td> <td>4,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,119\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance\n</td> <td>1,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities gains (losses)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trust and wealth management fees\n</td> <td>1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,373\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income for 2017 was $135.0 million compared to $141.3 million in 2016, a $6.4 million, or 4.5% decrease. This decrease was primarily a result of decreases in mortgage banking, indirect lending, and SBA lending activities as noted below.\nNoninterest income from mortgage banking decreased by $2.8 million, or 2.7%, to $98.8 million in 2017, compared to $101.6 million in 2016. The year over year decrease was primarily due to decreased mortgage loan production in 2017 compared to 2016 as mortgage lending volume in 2017 was affected by increasing interest rates. Mortgage loan production for the year decreased from $3.0 billion in 2016 to $2.8 billion in 2017, a $194.8 million, or 6.6%, year over year change. Decreased production led to a decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans sold from $2.8 billion in 2016 to $2.6 billion in 2017, a $226.6 million, or 8.0%, year over year change. Lower production and sales decreased gain on sales of mortgage loans, which decreased by $6.1 million or 7.4%, year over year, from $82.5 million in 2016 to $76.4 million in 2017. Decreased gains on mortgage loan sales were partially offset by an increase in mortgage servicing revenue $3.1 million, or 16.1%, to $22.2 million in 2017, compared to $19.1 million in 2016 as the portfolio of loans serviced for others grew by $1.1 billion, or 14.6%, in 2017. Net MSR impairment was $666,000 in 2017 compared to a net MSR recovery of $371,000 in 2016 primarily due to a large recovery in the last half of 2016.\nNoninterest income from indirect lending activities decreased by $2.4 million, or 15.9%, as indirect loan production decreased by $208.4 million, or 15.1%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, and indirect sales decreased by $79.3 million, or 15.5% leading to decreased gains on loan sales in 2017 as compared to 2016. Indirect servicing income remained consistent with 2016 at $9.2 million. The decrease in gains occurred due to the industry-wide weakening of the indirect auto loan sales market.\nNoninterest income from SBA lending activities decreased by $1.1 million or 19.8% in 2017, to $12.5 million, compared to 2016 due to lower sales of SBA loans in 2017, which resulted in lower gain on sales and lower capitalization of servicing rights. SBA servicing income remained consistent with 2016 at $2.5 million.\nThe increase in revenue from other fees and charges of $738,000, or 9.6%, stems from an increase in customer accounts, particularly due to the successful marketing campaign in Florida and increasing revenue from debit card and ATM fees in 2017, as compared to 2016.\nTrust and wealth management income increased $660,000, or 105.1%, to $1.3 million in 2017 compared to $628,000 in 2016 as Fidelity expanded its Wealth management services with the addition of client advisors in 2017.\nThe decrease in other miscellaneous income of $301,000, or 15.0%, from 2016 was caused by a $984,000 reduction in insurance commissions on policies sold on indirect auto loans reflecting decreased premium and increased losses which reduced contingent commissions and a $706,000 decrease in ORE gains. offset by an increase of $1.0 million resulting from a non-recurring gain related to the change in insurance providers during 2017, a $276,000 reduction in amortization on the FDIC indemnification asset due to expiring loss share agreements in 2017 and a $138,000 increase in gain on sale of fixed assets.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions\n</td> <td>34,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy\n</td> <td>18,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional and other services\n</td> <td>18,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>36,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense increased by $9.9 million, or 4.9%, in 2017 to $210.9 million compared to 2016, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits and to increases in professional and other services.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased by $6.7 million, or 6.9%, in 2017, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries and employee benefits associated with the net addition of 110 full-time equivalent employees during 2017, primarily due to organic growth in the mortgage and Wealth Management divisions, and expense related to our operational excellence initiative launched earlier in the year. Commissions increased by $666,000 despite the slight decrease in mortgage loan production, primarily due to the increase in mortgage originators and the impact of guaranteed commissions paid to new mortgage originators in expansion markets.\nProfessional and other services also increased by $3.1 million, or 20.5%, primarily due to increased expenses paid to vendors for infrastructure improvement projects and costs associated with new and existing regulations. Fidelity remains committed to implementing changes to operations and technology that will enable the Bank to be more efficient and effective in its growth strategies.\nOther operating expenses were $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $891,000, or 2.4%, decrease compared to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is a result of decreases in OREO expenses and writedowns due to fewer OREO properties in 2017 compared to 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2017 and 2016, was $15.3 million and $22.1 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 27.7% and 36.4%, respectively. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, Fidelity remeasured its net deferred tax liability position to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This revaluation resulted in a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $4.9 million in 2017.\nExcluding the effects of the one-time tax benefit recorded to revalue the net deferred tax liability and the benefit of discrete items recorded during the quarter for employee stock option exercises, the effective tax rate was 38.2% in 2017 compared to 36.4% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 is primarily driven by an increase in permanent unfavorable book/tax differences as a percentage of pretax book income, mainly related to vesting of restricted stock grants.\nThe one-time tax benefit recorded during the year to remeasure the net deferred tax liability represents a reasonable estimate determined by management. Any adjustments to provisional amounts determined during the measurement period will be reported as an adjustment to income tax expense or benefit in future periods. In addition, the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability as a result of the rate change does not have any cash flow effect and the change in the tax rate does not impact the time frame when the net deferred tax liability is expected to be settled.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets grew to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $156.9 million, or 3.4%, compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in cash of $26.0 million, and an increase in investments securities available-for-sale of $131.5 million as the we repositioned our balance sheet to higher yielding investments over the year.\nWe manage our assets and liabilities to maximize long-term earnings opportunities while maintaining the integrity of our financial position and the quality of earnings. To accomplish this objective, management strives for efficient management of interest rate risk and liquidity needs. The primary objectives of interest-sensitivity management are to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on the net interest margin and to manage the exposure to risk while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels. Liquidity is provided by our attempt to carefully structure our balance sheet as well as through both unsecured and secured lines of credit with other financial institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the FHLB\u201d), and the FRB.\nThe Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d), which is comprised of various senior executives, meets regularly to review our interest rate sensitivity positions and balance sheet mix; monitor our capital position and ratios; review our product offerings and pricing, including rates, fees and charges; monitor our funding needs and sources; and review cash flows to assess our current and projected liquidity. Throughout 2018, we have focused on executing our business strategy to re-balance our loan portfolio with higher-yielding commercial credits and de-emphasize indirect auto lending which is dependent on our growth.\nVisa Class B Stock\nAs of December 31, 2018, we owned 46,436 shares of Class B common stock of Visa, Inc. We received these Class B shares in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A shares. This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which is indemnified by Visa members. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Should this escrow account not be sufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank's Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares. Effective June 28, 2018, the conversion rate for each Class B common share decreased to 1.6298 shares of Class A common stock. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the covered litigation, the Visa Class B shares (75,681 Class A equivalent shares) that we own are carried at a zero cost basis as of December 31, 2018.\nFair Value Adjustments\nLoan servicing rights increased by $7.8 million, or 6.9%, to $120.4 million at December 31, 2018, compared to December 31, 2017. MSRs, the primary component of loan servicing rights, contributed the majority of the change, increasing by $10.7 million or 10.7%, to $111.4 million, offset primarily by decreasing indirect auto servicing rights of $2.7 million at December 31, 2018. The current estimated fair market value of MSRs was $116.8 million at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, fair value adjustments recorded on the balance sheet for loans held-for-sale, interest rate lock commitments (\"IRLCs\"), and hedge items were $8.8 million, a $1.5 million, or 15.0% decrease, from December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2018, the gross pipeline of interest rate lock commitments was $225.7 million, a $21.8 million, or 10.7%, increase from December 31, 2017.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is defined as the sensitivity of income, fair value measurements and capital to changes in market rates or prices. Our primary market risk exposure is credit risk and, to a lesser extent, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. We have little or no risk related to trading accounts, commodities, or foreign exchange. Our real estate loan portfolio is subject to risks associated with the local economies of our various markets and, in particular, the regional economy of the South.\nInterest rate risk, which encompasses price risk, is the exposure of our financial condition and earnings ability to withstand adverse movements in interest rates. Price and interest rate risks arise from the financial instruments and positions we hold including loans, mortgage servicing rights, investment securities, deposits, borrowings, and derivative financial instruments. Accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value; however, excessive levels of interest rate risk can pose a significant threat to assets, earnings, and capital. Accordingly, effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our success.\nALCO monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in portfolio values and net interest income with changes in interest rates. The primary purposes of ALCO are to manage our interest rate risk consistent with earnings and liquidity, to effectively invest our capital, and to preserve the value created by our core business operations. In addition, our exposure to interest rate risk is compared to established tolerances on at least a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.\nEvaluating our exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process we use to control interest rate risk and our quantitative levels of exposure. When assessing the interest rate risk management process, we seek to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems, and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity. Evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure\nrequires us to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity, and, where appropriate, asset quality.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nThe primary tool management uses to estimate and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is an asset/liability simulation model. Resulting estimates are based on a number of assumptions for each scenario, including the level of balance sheet growth, loan and deposit repricing characteristics, and the rate of prepayment. Additionally, the fair value of our MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in market implied interest rate volatility. ALCO periodically reviews the assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations; however, actual net interest income may differ from model results.\nThe primary objective of the simulation model is to measure the potential change in net interest revenue over time using multiple interest rate scenarios. The base scenario assumes the most likely estimate of future interest rate increases and balance sheet changes and is the scenario from which others are compared. Policy limits are based on immediate rate shock scenarios which are compared to the base scenario. While the primary policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame, longer time horizons are also modeled. In addition, management reviews the impact of various yield curve scenarios on earnings and cash flows. Our policy states that an immediate and sustained 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not negatively impact net interest income by more than 10%.\nWe also use the simulation model to calculate the sensitivity of the economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) under various interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of assets less the net present value of liabilities, net of any impact due to derivatives.\nThe following table summarizes the results of a 12-month forecasting period of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of 100 and 200 basis points in market interest rates as of December 31, 2018, and 2017:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Point Change in Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change in Projected\nNet Interest Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-4.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-3.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-7.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-5.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear over year balance sheet changes and assumption updates have slightly increased net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The rate shock analysis at December 31, 2018 indicated that all of the scenarios would fall within policy parameters and approved tolerances for net interest income and EVE at risk. If large downward shocks were to occur from today's low rates, increased MSR modeled impairment may breach net income benchmarks.\nRate shock analysis provides only a limited, point in time view of interest rate sensitivity. The actual impact of interest rate changes upon earnings and net present value may differ from that implied by any rate shock. In addition, net interest income and net present value under various future interest rate scenarios are affected by multiple other factors not embodied in a rate shock, including competition, changes in the shape of the Treasury yield curve, divergent movement among various interest rate indices, and the speed with which interest rates change.\nLiquidity\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and that of financial institutions in general largely determines the access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound credit quality and appropriate levels of capital resources.\nWe define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations and to meet our financial obligations at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis including repayment of borrowings, anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals by customers. Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital if we are unable to fulfill our obligations as they become due. Liquidity risk can also develop if we fail to timely recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect our ability to obtain adequate funding to continue to operate on a profitable basis.\nWe mitigate liquidity risk by funding our asset growth with low-cost core deposits. In addition to monitoring our interest rate sensitivity, ALCO also manages our liquidity risk. ALCO meets regularly to review the current and projected net liquidity positions and to review actions taken by management to achieve this liquidity objective. The Board of Directors also reviews performance against internal liquidity benchmarks on at least a quarterly basis.\nManaging the levels of total liquidity, short-term liquidity, and short-term liquidity sources continues to be an important and complex exercise because of the coordination of the projected mortgage, SBA and indirect automobile loan production and sales, loans held-for-sale balances, and individual loans and pools of loans sold anticipated to fluctuate during the year. We also have fluctuating obligations related to our portfolio of loans serviced for others such as advances we are obligated to make to\ninvestors to fund scheduled principal, interest, tax and insurance payments that mortgage loan borrowers have failed to make, to cover foreclosure costs and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced. These servicer advance obligations require capital and liquidity to fund these advances until we are contractually authorized to be reimbursed from the loan investors. While the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors, one of the primary goals of ALCO is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in both normal operating conditions and in periods of internal or industry stress.\nManagement measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis. Sources of the Bank's liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities; investment securities eligible for sale or pledging to secure borrowings from customers pursuant to securities sold under agreements to repurchase; loan repayments; loan sales; etc.\nOur liabilities also provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposits and certain interest-sensitive deposits, brokered deposits, available unsecured overnight federal funds lines from correspondent banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings such as a collateralized line of credit at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta ( FRB\u201d) Discount Window and a collateralized line of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB\u201d).\nWe engage in routine activities to retain customer deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Offer rate specials on Certificates of Deposit (\"CD's\") and other deposit promotional offerings to attract new deposit relationships and fund balance sheet growth;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pricing deposits, including CD's, at rate levels that will sustain balances at levels that will enhance our asset liability management and net interest margin requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Management seeks to maintain a stable net liquidity position while optimizing operating results, as reflected in net interest income, the net yield spread on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in particular. We deploy our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs.\nOur ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, which typically includes some level of federal funds sold, cash balances at the FRB, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; being in a well-capitalized position; and having profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt the Bank's desired liquidity position at any time. Under such circumstances, our federal funds sold position, or cash balances at the FRB, if any, serve as the primary sources of immediate liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our cash and liquid securities totaled 10.2% and 7.2% of assets, respectively, providing ample liquidity to support our existing operations. In addition to cash and liquid securities, as of December 31, 2018, we had the following sources of available unused liquidity:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FRB discount window\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB advances\n</td> <td>590,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokered CD's\n</td> <td>493,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unpledged securities\n</td> <td>118,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured federal funds lines\n</td> <td>215,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sources of available unused liquidity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,652,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFHLB borrowing capacity is based on the lower of 25% of assets or pledged loans' lendable collateral value less outstanding advance balances. As of December 31, 2018, there was $590.7 million FHLB capacity with $125.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding, additionally, there was $92.0 million brokered CD's outstanding with remaining capacity of $493.6 million. We hold investments in FHLB stock for the purposes of maintaining credit lines with the FHLB.\nOur loans held for sale are considered highly liquid. The majority of these loans are conforming residential mortgage loans sold to GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. Other categories of loans held for sale include the government-guaranteed portion of SBA loans and the balance of indirect automobile loans purchased from motor vehicle dealers. The portfolio of indirect auto loans held for sale fluctuates based on the demand for loan sales from investors, mainly other financial institutions which has declined in recent years.\nWe believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements and contractual obligations. Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on liquidity levels. Our Board of Directors reviews liquidity benchmarks quarterly. Also, we review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position\nand our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulator. We also maintain various wholesale sources of funding and expect our interest cost to vary based on the range of interest rates charged.\nIn addition, due to FSC being a separate entity and apart from the Bank, it must provide for its own liquidity. FSC is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its common and preferred shareholders, and interest and principal on any outstanding debt or trust preferred securities. Substantially all of FSC's cashflow obtained from capital raises and dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiaries, LionMark Insurance Company and the Bank, which are limited by applicable law. In addition, the Bank pays interest to FSC on the Bank's subordinated debt. Under the regulations of the GDBF, bank dividends may not exceed 50% of the prior year's net earnings without approval from the GDBF. If dividends received from the Bank were reduced or eliminated, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, FSC had available cash balances of approximately $10.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively. This cash is available for general corporate purposes, including debt service on subordinated debt outstanding of $46.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, providing capital support to the Bank and potential future acquisitions.\nIn addition, FSC filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on May 5, 2017 for up to $100 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, or debt securities, to be issued from time to time for general corporate purposes which may include funding bank and non-bank subsidiaries, financing business expansion, or refinancing or extending the maturity of debt obligations and investments at the holding company level. The amount was available to be issued as of June 15, 2017, which was the date that the SEC issued a Notice of Effectiveness. As of December 31, 2018, we have not issued any securities under the shelf registration statement and, due to the pending merger, we do not anticipate issuing any securities under this registration statement.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following schedule provides a summary of our financial commitments to make future payments, primarily to fund loan and other credit obligations, long-term debt, and rental commitments under operating leases of various facilities housing our business development, executive administration and operational support functions as of December 31, 2018. Loan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these commitments are revolving\u201d commitments as discussed below and many are expected to expire unused or partially used, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Payments for borrowings do not include interest. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commitment Maturity or Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year or\nLess\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n1 Year but\nLess Than\n3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Years or\nMore but\nLess Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years or\nMore\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate, construction and land development loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>216,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit and bankers acceptances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loan commitments(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>646,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental commitments(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>614,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>835,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokered time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commitments and long-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,166,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,892,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Financial commitments include both secured and unsecured obligations to fund.

These financial instruments, which include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.\nOur exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by customers for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for recorded loans. Loan commitments and other off-balance sheet exposures are evaluated by the Credit Review department quarterly and reserves are provided for risk as deemed appropriate.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Thus, we will deny funding a commitment if the borrower's financial condition deteriorates during the commitment period, such that the customer no longer meets the pre-established conditions of lending. Commitments\ngenerally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nStandby and import letters of credit are commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans or lines of credit to customers. We hold collateral supporting those commitments as deemed necessary.\nLoans\nTotal loans, which include loans held for investment and loans held-for-sale, decreased by $13.9 million, or 0.4%, at December 31, 2018 over December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in indirect auto loans of $221.9 million, as Fidelity exited all markets except Florida and Georgia. This decrease was offset by growth in all other loan categories, particularly commercial and residential mortgage. The loan portfolio is the largest component of our earning assets. The volume of loans is a key driver of our net interest margin as loans typically product higher yields than investment securities and other earning assets. Our strategy is to grow loans in all categories by originating loans that we believe to be of high quality that comply with our conservative credit policies with terms that produce revenues that meet our financial objectives.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amount of total loans by loan type:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

production, particularly in residential mortgage, commercial, and construction loans. In addition, we have exercised our buy-back option on delinquent mortgage loans serviced for GNMA since 2014, adding $24.6 million and $7.5 million in unpaid principal balances in residential mortgage loans held for investment to the portfolio during 2018 and 2017, respectively. We chose to exercise our buy-back option to avoid continuing to advance principal and interest on delinquent mortgage loans previously sold to the investor pool which allows us to work the loans through to resolution using our internal resources.\nIndirect automobile loans decreased by $146.9 million, or 8.6%, over December 31, 2017 as lower sales volume was noted in 2018 as compared to 2017 as the bank completed its strategy to exit all markets except for Georgia and Florida. Residential mortgage loans increased by $104.4 million, or 21.3%, over December 31, 2017 as solid production in the residential mortgage portfolio continued. Commercial loans increased by $93.0 million, or 11.5%, over December 31, 2017 and construction loans increased by $31.1 million, or 12.5%, compared to December 31, 2017, as we have added new lenders in our strategy to re-balance the portfolio with higher-yielding commercial credits and de-emphasizing indirect auto lending.\nLoans held-for-sale at December 31, 2018 decreased by $118.5 million, or 33.1%, over December 31, 2017. The indirect auto portfolio held-for-sale balance decreased by $75.0 million to zero, as only one loan sale occurred during the second half of\n2018. We do not intend to have indirect auto loan sales in 2019. In addition, a decrease in residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $43.8 million, or 16.3% is the result of slower sales in 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of loans held for investment by remaining scheduled contractual maturity as of December 31, 2018.

We manage and control risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to standards established by the Board of Directors and senior management, combined with a commitment to producing quality assets, monitoring loan performance, developing profitable relationships, and meeting the strategic loan quality and growth targets. Our credit policies establish underwriting standards, place limits on exposures, which include concentrations and commitments, and set other limits or standards as deemed necessary and prudent. Also included in the policy, primarily determined by the amount and type of loan, are various approval levels, ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized.\nWe maintain a diversified loan portfolio intended to spread risk and reduce exposure to economic downturns, which may occur in different segments of the economy or in particular industries. Industry and loan type diversification is reviewed at least quarterly. Management has taken numerous steps to reduce credit risk in the loan portfolio and to strengthen the credit risk management team and processes. In addition, credit policies are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. Experienced managers are in place, strengthening lending areas and Credit Administration.\nThe provision for loan losses was $5.5 million in 2018 and $4.3 million in 2017, an increase of $1.2 million, primarily due to the increase in the commercial loan portfolio and the associated qualitative risk factor. Net charge-offs were relatively flat from the previous year at $4.1 million in 2018 and $4.2 million in 2017.\nThe Credit Review Department ( Credit Review\u201d) regularly reports to senior management and the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as well as trends in the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Credit Review monitors loan concentrations, production, loan growth, as well as loan quality, and independent from the lending departments, reviews risk ratings and tests credits approved for adherence to our lending standards. Finally, Credit Review also performs ongoing, independent reviews of the risk management process and adequacy of loan documentation. The results of its reviews are reported to the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors. The consumer collection function is centralized and automated to ensure timely collection of accounts and consistent management of risks associated with delinquent accounts.\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans (including repurchased government guaranteed loans), loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, repossessions, and other real estate (\"ORE\"). Nonaccrual loans are loans on which the interest accruals have been discontinued when it appears that future collection of principal or interest according to the contractual terms may be doubtful. Troubled debt restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been modified, because of economic or legal\nreasons related to the debtors' financial difficulties and provide a concession to the borrower such as, a reduction in principal, change in terms, or modification of interest rates to below market levels. Repossessions include vehicles and other personal property that have been repossessed as a result of payment defaults. ORE is recorded at the lower of cost or market less the estimated cost to sell which is subject to future declines in real estate values. Purchased credit impaired loans are considered to be performing due to the application of the accretion method and are excluded from the table.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repossessions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate (\"ORE\")\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing to total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans, repossessions and ORE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of adjusted nonperforming assets to adjusted loans, repossessions and ORE (non-GAAP)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Interest income recognized year to date on these loans was approximately $530,000 in 2018 and $455,000 in 2017.\n(2) Excludes GNMA and SBA guaranteed loans and acquired loans. See non-GAAP reconciliation table for a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure.\nThe increase in nonperforming assets of $8.1 million from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018, primarily resulted from an increase in nonaccrual loans, which increased by $7.7 million from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual residential mortgage loans of $10.3 million. This increase was primarily due to repurchases of government guaranteed loans discussed below.\nThe Bank had $24.6 million in troubled debt restructured loans at December 31, 2018, of which $16.2 million were accruing loans and $8.4 million are on nonaccrual status and are included in nonperforming assets in the table above.\nThere were $2.3 million in loans covered under Loss Share Agreements with the FDIC at December 31, 2017 and no loans covered by Loss Share Agreements in 2018. Of these loans in 2017, $113,000 were past due 90 days or more and $2.3 million were in accrual status due to being in PCI pools.\nLoans accruing delinquent 30-89 days increased by $2.7 million at December 31, 2018, to $24.7 million compared to $22.1 million at December 31, 2017, mainly due to increases in 30-89 days delinquencies in the mortgage loan and construction loan portfolios over the year. Of the $12.6 million in 30-89 day delinquencies in the mortgage loan portfolio, $9.2 million were only past due 30 days primarily due to timing of month end in December.\nIncluded in nonaccrual loans are $29.1 million and $19.5 million in government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These loans are collateralized by first mortgages on the underlying real estate collateral and are individually reviewed for a specific allowance. The Company's loss exposure on the repurchased government-guaranteed loans is mitigated by the government guarantee in whole or in part.\nManagement believes it has been proactive in charging down and charging off nonperforming assets as appropriate. Management's assessment of the overall loan portfolio is that loan quality and performance have improved in recent years, as indicated by the steady decrease in our nonperforming asset ratios. Management is being aggressive in evaluating credit relationships and proactive in addressing problems.\nWhen a loan is classified as nonaccrual, to the extent collection is in question, previously accrued interest is reversed and interest income is reduced by the interest accrued in the current year, in which case interest advanced to the investor pool prior to the buyback of government guaranteed loans discussed above is not reversed but is capitalized for future reimbursement as part of the government guarantee. For 2018, the gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans, if all such loans had been accruing interest at the original contract rate, was approximately $1.9 million compared to $2.2 million and $1.6 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. For additional information on nonaccrual loans see Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nAs discussed in Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are estimated based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio on at least a quarterly basis which are determined based on current economic conditions, loan portfolio concentrations, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off in whole or in part when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequently, recoveries are added to the allowance.\nManagement divides the portfolio into the following loan categories: commercial, SBA, construction, indirect auto, consumer installment, and residential mortgage. For each loan category, historical loan loss experience, adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of each loan category, current trends, and other factors, is used to determine the level of allowance required. Additional amounts are provided based on the probable losses of individual impaired loans and the effect of economic conditions and other qualitative factors on both individual loans and loan categories. Since the provision is based on estimates and subjective judgment, it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts of losses that may ultimately occur.\nPerforming loans are treated as homogeneous pools and the allowance for loan losses for these loans is based on historical net charge-off rates adjusted for current trends in qualitative factors. Nonperforming and substandard loans, typically commercial and construction loans with outstanding balances exceeding $50,000, as well as certain other performing loans with greater than normal credit risk characteristics, are not treated as homogeneous pools and are instead individually reviewed for a specific allowance. The specific allowance for these individually reviewed loans is based on a specific loan impairment analysis based on the latest appraised value using independent appraisers, trends of similar property values within our market areas and our own observations and experience with similar properties. The unallocated portion of the allowance reflects a margin for the imprecision inherent in estimates of the range of the probable credit losses.\nAt December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses was $31.2 million, or 0.85% of loans, compared to $29.8 million, or 0.83% of loans, at December 31, 2017. The allowance (excluding acquired and indirect allowance) to adjusted loans (excluding acquired and indirect loans), a non-GAAP measure, was 1.12% at December 31, 2018 compared to 1.16% at December 31, 2017. Management uses this measure to provide better visibility into the allowance as part of its strategic initiative to de-emphasize indirect loans and grow loans in categories other than indirect, mainly commercial, construction and SBA. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding during each respective period were 0.11% in 2018, a slight decrease as compared to 0.12% for 2017.\nThe table below presents the allocated

through the employment of excess funds not needed for loan demand or to offset fluctuations in deposits, while providing for pledging and liquidity needs within overall asset and liability management parameters. Our investment activities are governed internally by our Board-approved investment policy and carried out by our Treasury department. Investment strategies are reviewed by the ALCO based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan production and sales, projected funding needs and overall sensitivity to interest rate risk.\nWe are required under federal regulations to maintain adequate liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. As such, management regularly evaluates the investment portfolio for cash flows, the level of loan production, current interest rate risk strategies and the potential future direction of market interest rate changes. Over the longer term, the size and composition of the investment securities portfolio will reflect balance sheet trends, our overall liquidity objectives, and interest rate risk management objectives. Accordingly, the size and composition of the investment securities portfolio could change over time. Individual investment securities differ in terms of default, interest rate, liquidity and expected rate of return risk. We maintain a relatively high percentage of the investment securities portfolio as available-for-sale to meet possible liquidity needs including pledging as collateral for public deposits and borrowings. The held-to-maturity investment securities are primarily utilized for pledging as collateral for public deposits. Investment security cash-flow reinvestment and additional investment may occur as interest rates increase in the foreseeable future.\nOur investment securities consisted primarily of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government-sponsored entities (\"GSE's\") which expose us to a low level of credit and liquidity risk.

We provide a full range of deposit accounts and services to both individuals and businesses for which we charge reasonable service fees such as monthly account maintenance fees, overdraft fees, etc. While retail deposits are a primary source of funding and provide a customer base for cross-selling additional products and services, we also emphasize commercial accounts as an opportunity for growth and to meet our business customers' needs. We also utilize brokered time deposits as a funding source, although to a lesser degree.\nTotal deposits of $4.0 billion at December 31, 2018 increased by $114.4 million, or 3.0%, compared to December 31, 2017. Core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing demand accounts and interest-bearing demand accounts, including money market accounts and savings deposits accounted for $111.2 million of the increase, as the result of our continuing transaction account acquisition initiative, in both commercial and consumer accounts.

Average time deposits for 2018 decreased by $106.8 million, or 10.5%, from 2017, as the enhanced core deposit base allowed the Bank to be more relationship-oriented in its approach to time deposits and non-core brokered CD's. Total average deposits for 2017 increased by $364.2 million, or 10.5%, over 2016, with $386.8 million of the increase coming from core deposits.

We enter into FHLB advances with terms that are consistent with our interest rate risk position at the time we enter into each advance. Our FHLB advances mature in less than one year and are collateralized with qualifying residential mortgage, home equity and commercial real estate loans and, from time to time, agency notes or agency mortgage-backed securities.\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $125.0 million in fixed rate FHLB advances outstanding. In addition, we utilized overnight funding sources of $14.8 million and $25.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in both categories from December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of fluctuations in short-term liquidity needs which the Bank primarily manages through short-term FHLB advances which we chose to utilize as a funding source for loan growth due to the advantageous rates available in comparison to other funding sources.\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements consist of balances in the transaction accounts of our commercial customers swept nightly to an overnight investment account. Securities sold under repurchase agreements are not subject to offset.\nThe interest rate characteristics of our short-term borrowings are presented in the table below:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreements at an average period-end rate of 0.26% and 0.19% for 2018 and 2017, respectively\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FRB Discount Window with variable interest of 3.00% for 2018\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB Fixed Rate Credit Advances with an interest rate of 2.46% for 2018 and interest rates ranging from 1.41% to 1.42% for 2017\n</td> <td>125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSchedule of Short-term Borrowings\nThe following information regarding short-term borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 pertains to our overnight repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and federal funds purchased.

Related interest expense is reported as Interest expense: Subordinated debt\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nOn May 29, 2015, the Bank issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (the Notes\u201d). The Notes are due May 31, 2030 and bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.875% per year until May 31, 2025. From June 1, 2025 to the maturity date, the interest rate will be a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 363 basis points. The Bank incurred approximately $1.1 million of acquisition costs in connection with the debt issuance. The Notes were priced at 100% of their par value. We can call the Notes at their par value in whole or in part on June 1, 2025 or any interest payment date thereafter. The Notes contain certain restrictions on the merger or consolidation of the Company or the sale or transfer of its assets into another entity. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 regulatory capital for the Bank and the Company.\nOn August 20, 2007, we issued $20.0 million in fixed-floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust III with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest was fixed at 6.62% for five years and converted to a floating rate, which adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, with a rate of 4.19% and 2.99% at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed with regulatory approval at any distribution payment date or at any time upon certain events, such as a change in the regulatory treatment of the trust preferred securities, at the redemption price of 100%.\nOn March 17, 2005, we issued $10.0 million in floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust II with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.89%, with a rate of 4.68% and 3.49% at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\nOn June 26, 2003, we issued $15.0 million in Floating Rate Capital Securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust I with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 3.10%. The rates in effect on December 31, 2018 and 2017, were 5.92% and 4.77%, respectively. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\nThe trust preferred securities were sold in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and were not registered under the Securities Act. The payments to the holders of trust preferred securities are fully tax deductible.\nThe $45.0 million of trust preferred securities issued by our trusts, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Thus, the equity investments in the subsidiaries we created to issue the obligations, the obligations themselves, and related dividend income and interest expense are reported on an unconsolidated basis, with the investments in the amount of $1.4 million at December 31, 2018, and 2017, reported as other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and dividends included as other noninterest income in our Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nWe included the $45.0 million of trust preferred securities in our Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2018 and 2017 as an element of restricted core capital. Restricted core capital elements are subject to an aggregate 25% of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill limitation, as defined by the regulatory risk-based capital standards for bank holding companies. These standards also require that trust preferred securities be excluded from Tier 1 capital within five years of the maturity of the underlying junior subordinated notes issued. Our first junior subordinated note matures in June 2033.\nShareholders' Equity\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $446.2 million and $401.6 million, respectively. The $44.6 million increase in shareholders' equity over December 31, 2017 was attributable to net income earned of $43.8 million, and common\nstock issued under employee programs of $13.3 million during 2018, partially offset by cash dividends declared on common shares during 2018 of $13.0 million.\nIn December 2008, as part of the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, the U.S. Treasury purchased 48,200 shares of the Company's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Stock\u201d), and a warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $48.2 million in cash. On June 27, 2012, the Treasury sold all of its shares of the Company's Preferred Stock in a public offering as part of a modified Dutch auction process. The Company did not receive any proceeds from this auction.\nOn May 28, 2015, the U.S. Treasury sold its warrant in a private transaction with two unaffiliated third-party investors.\nWarrant exercises in 2016 and 2015 described below by third-party investors resulted in there being no shares eligible to be purchased pursuant to the Warrant at December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. At December 31, 2015, one investor had a warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock.\nDuring 2016 and 2015, we received Warrant exercise notices for cash and cashless exercises, resulting in the issuance of 1,000,000 and 1,487,487 shares of common stock, respectively. In 2016, all exercises were cash exercises for aggregate proceeds of $2.7 million, resulting in the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of common stock. During 2016, 1,346,873 equivalent shares exercised were cashless, resulting in the issuance of 1,140,614 shares of common stock and cash exercise aggregated $931,354, resulting in the issuance of 346,873 shares of common stock.\nOn May 5, 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of up to $100 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, or debt securities, to be issued from time to time for general corporate purposes which may include funding bank and non-bank subsidiaries, financing business expansion, or refinancing or extending the maturity of debt obligations and investments at the holding company level. The amount was available to be issued as of June 15, 2017, which was the date that the SEC issued a Notice of Effectiveness. As of December 31, 2018, we have not issued any securities under the shelf registration statement and, due to the merger with Ameris; we do not anticipate issuing any securities under the shelf registration.\nOn December 17, 2018, Fidelity entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Ameris Bancorp (\"Ameris\"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth, FSC will merge with and into Ameris (the Merger\u201d), in an all-stock transaction, with Ameris surviving the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the Bank will merge (the Bank Merger\u201d) with and into Ameris's wholly owned bank subsidiary, Ameris Bank. Ameris Bank will be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger. The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the board of directors of each of Fidelity and Ameris. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter 2019. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to the approval of FSC's shareholders, regulators, and certain other customary closing conditions.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, Fidelity's shareholders will have the right to receive 0.80 shares (the Exchange Ratio\u201d) of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Ameris Common Stock for each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Fidelity Common Stock that they hold, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information relating to recent accounting standards and pronouncements, see Footnote 1 to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements entitled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain consolidated quarterly financial information.

The $1.0 million increase in net income in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to an increase in interest income of $8.7 million, a decrease in income tax expense of $6.9 million, and a decrease in provision for loan losses of $4.0 million; offset by a decrease in noninterest income of $6.4 million, an increase in noninterest expense of $9.9 million, and an increase in interest expense of $2.3 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below.\n\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Industry and loan type diversification is reviewed at least quarterly. Management has taken numerous steps to reduce credit risk in the loan portfolio and to strengthen the credit risk management team and processes. In addition, credit policies are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. Experienced managers are in place, strengthening lending areas and Credit Administration.\nIn addition to homogeneous pools of loans, every commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loan is assigned a risk rating using established credit policy guidelines. All nonperforming commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loans and loans deemed to have greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed monthly by our Credit Review Department to determine the level of additional allowance for loan losses, if any, required to be specifically assigned to these loans.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Thus, we will deny funding a commitment if the borrower's financial condition deteriorates during the commitment period, such that the customer no longer meets the pre-established conditions of lending.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNoninterest income from mortgage banking decreased by $2.8 million, or 2.7%, to $98.8 million in 2017, compared to $101.6 million in 2016. The year over year decrease was primarily due to decreased mortgage loan production in 2017 compared to 2016 as mortgage lending volume in 2017 was affected by increasing interest rates. Mortgage loan production for the year decreased from $3.0 billion in 2016 to $2.8 billion in 2017, a $194.8 million, or 6.6%, year over year change. Decreased production led to a decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans sold from $2.8 billion in 2016 to $2.6 billion in 2017, a $226.6 million, or 8.0%, year over year change. Lower production and sales decreased gain on sales of mortgage loans, which decreased by $6.1 million or 7.4%, year over year, from $82.5 million in 2016 to $76.4 million in 2017. Decreased gains on mortgage loan sales were partially offset by an increase in mortgage servicing revenue $3.1 million, or 16.1%, to $22.2 million in 2017, compared to $19.1 million in 2016 as the portfolio of loans serviced for others grew by $1.1 billion, or 14.6%, in 2017. Net MSR impairment was $666,000 in 2017 compared to a net MSR recovery of $371,000 in 2016 primarily due to a large recovery in the last half of 2016.\nServicing assets and servicing liabilities are initially recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value when loans are sold with servicing retained with the income statement effect recorded in gains on sales of loans. In evaluating servicing rights and estimating the fair value of the underlying loan pools based on the present value of net future cash flows, we use a number of assumptions and estimates including: prepayment speeds, discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, potential credit losses, and comparable assumptions used by market participants to value and bid servicing rights available for sale in the market. When the contractually specified servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. When the expected income to a servicer for performing loan servicing is not expected to adequately compensate a servicer, a capitalized servicing liability is recognized.\nThe amortized cost, fair value and average yield of investment securities are categorized in the following table by remaining contractual maturity.

Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Accordingly, we determined the fair value of our reporting unit and compared the fair value to the reporting unit's carrying amount. We determined that our reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying amount; therefore, we concluded our goodwill was not impaired. No events have occurred since the last annual goodwill impairment assessment that would necessitate an interim goodwill impairment assessment.

We received these Class B shares in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A shares. This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which is indemnified by Visa members. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Should this escrow account not be sufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank's Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares. Effective June 28, 2018, the conversion rate for each Class B common share decreased to 1.6298 shares of Class A common stock. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the covered litigation, the Visa Class B shares (75,681 Class A equivalent shares) that we own are carried at a zero cost basis as of December 31, 2018.\nOn May 5, 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of up to $100 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, or debt securities, to be issued from time to time for general corporate purposes which may include funding bank and non-bank subsidiaries, financing business expansion, or refinancing or extending the maturity of debt obligations and investments at the holding company level. The amount was available to be issued as of June 15, 2017, which was the date that the SEC issued a Notice of Effectiveness. As of December 31, 2018, we have not issued any securities under the shelf registration statement and, due to the merger with Ameris; we do not anticipate issuing any securities under the shelf registration.\nIn 2018, net charge-offs totaled $4.1 million, a slight decrease of $37,000, or 0.9%, as compared to 2017. Net charge-offs decreased in the commercial and consumer portfolios, due to fewer charge-offs and/or higher recoveries in these portfolios than in the previous year. The decreases in net charge-offs in these portfolios were offset by higher charge-offs in the SBA and mortgage portfolios and lower recoveries in the construction portfolio.\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\nThe decrease in other miscellaneous income of $301,000, or 15.0%, from 2016 was caused by a $984,000 reduction in insurance commissions on policies sold on indirect auto loans reflecting decreased premium and increased losses which reduced contingent commissions and a $706,000 decrease in ORE gains. offset by an increase of $1.0 million resulting from a non-recurring gain related to the change in insurance providers during 2017, a $276,000 reduction in amortization on the FDIC indemnification asset due to expiring loss share agreements in 2017 and a $138,000 increase in gain on sale of fixed assets.\nWe account for our acquisitions as business combinations, which require the use of the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values, which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques. The determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective, as is the appropriate amortization method for such intangible assets.\nOther operating expenses were $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $891,000, or 2.4%, decrease compared to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is a result of decreases in OREO expenses and writedowns due to fewer OREO properties in 2017 compared to 2016.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\nValue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities available-for-sale:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligations of GSE's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA pool securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total available-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities held-to-maturity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total held-to-maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs.

in Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are estimated based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio on at least a quarterly basis which are determined based on current economic conditions, loan portfolio concentrations, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off in whole or in part when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequently, recoveries are added to the allowance.\nAt December 31, 2018, fair value adjustments recorded on the balance sheet for loans held-for-sale, interest rate lock commitments (\"IRLCs\"),

The majority of the noninterest income earned from these sources is generated from gains on sales of loans including recognition of loan servicing revenue as the majority of loans are sold. The retained servicing obligation generates servicing revenue over the life of the loans sold. The revenue generated from gains on sales of loans and related servicing is partially offset by amortization and possible impairment of the related servicing rights. Servicing rights are amortized in proportion to the estimated future servicing income on the underlying loans sold. Impairment on servicing rights is recorded based on changes in the estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses on the underlying loans sold.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of loans held for investment by remaining scheduled contractual maturity as of December 31, 2018. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity, and overdraft loans are reported as being due within one year or less:\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers, and to reduce our own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments, which include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.\nWe define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations and to meet our financial obligations at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis including repayment of borrowings, anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals by customers. Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital if we are unable to fulfill our obligations as they become due. Liquidity risk can also develop if we fail to timely recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect our ability to obtain adequate funding to continue to operate on a profitable basis.\nThe credit risk associated with the underlying cash flows of instruments carried at fair value was a consideration in estimating the fair value of certain financial instruments. Credit risk was considered in the valuation through a variety of inputs, as applicable, including, the actual default and loss severity of the collateral, and level of subordination. The assumptions used to estimate credit risk incorporated relevant information that a market participant would likely use in valuing an instrument. Because mortgage loans held-for-sale are sold within a few weeks of origination, they are unlikely to demonstrate any of the credit weaknesses discussed above and as a result, there have been no credit related adjustments to fair value.\n (1) Weighted average yields are calculated on the basis of the amortized cost of the security. \nWe segregate loans acquired between loans for which there was a discount related, in part, to credit and loans for which there was not a material discount attributable to credit. Subsequent to the acquisition date, decreases in expected cash flows compared to initial estimates on the loans for which there was a credit discount are recognized as impairment through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in cash flows (in a loan pool where an allowance for loan losses on acquired loans was previously recorded) reduces the remaining allowance for loan losses on acquired loans before recalculating the amount of accretable yield percentage to be used going forward for the loan pool.\nEvaluating our exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process we use to control interest rate risk and our quantitative levels of exposure. When assessing the interest rate risk management process, we seek to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems, and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity. Evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure\nThe trust preferred securities were sold in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and were not registered under the Securities Act.

The indirect auto portfolio held-for-sale balance decreased by $75.0 million to zero, as only one loan sale occurred during the second half of\nOther operating expenses were $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $2.8 million, or 7.8%, increase compared to $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily related to $1.6 million increase in lending related expenses coupled with the recently announced merger related expenses.\n\nOther Real Estate ( ORE\u201d)\n(1) Percentage of the carrying value of the respective loan type to total loans.\nFinancial Performance\nWe also use the simulation model to calculate the sensitivity of the economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) under various interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of assets less the net present value of liabilities, net of any impact due to derivatives.\n\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nBecause we record acquired loans at fair value, we recorded no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans on the acquisition date, given that the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value estimates associated with the acquired loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\n \u2022 Offer rate specials on Certificates of Deposit (\"CD's\") and other deposit promotional offerings to attract new deposit relationships and fund balance sheet growth; \nThe credit risks inherent and evidenced in our acquisitions have resulted in a portion of the loans purchased in those transactions having a credit discount. On the date of acquisition, when the loans had evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and we believed it was probable that we would not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, we refer to the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected as the non-accretable\nSalaries and benefits expense increased by $6.7 million, or 6.9%, in 2017, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries and employee benefits associated with the net addition of 110 full-time equivalent employees during 2017, primarily due to organic growth in the mortgage and Wealth Management divisions, and expense related to our operational excellence initiative launched earlier in the year. Commissions increased by $666,000 despite the slight decrease in mortgage loan production, primarily due to the increase in mortgage originators and the impact of guaranteed commissions paid to new mortgage originators in expansion markets.\nNoninterest income from SBA lending activities increased by $2.2 million, or 48.2%, in 2018, to $5.2 million, compared to 2017 due to an increase of SBA loans sales by $19.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017, which resulted in higher gain on sales. SBA servicing income decreased by $298,000 in 2018 to $2.2 million compared to prior year.\nWhen a loan is classified as nonaccrual, to the extent collection is in question, previously accrued interest is reversed and interest income is reduced by the interest accrued in the current year, in which case interest advanced to the investor pool prior to the buyback of government guaranteed loans discussed above is not reversed but is capitalized for future reimbursement as part of the government guarantee. For 2018, the gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans, if all such loans had been accruing interest at the original contract rate, was approximately $1.9 million compared to $2.2 million and $1.6 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. For additional information on nonaccrual loans see Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\n\nrequires us to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity, and, where appropriate, asset quality.\nOur exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by customers for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for recorded loans. Loan commitments and other off-balance sheet exposures are evaluated by the Credit Review department quarterly and reserves are provided for risk as deemed appropriate.\n\nThe primary objective of the simulation model is to measure the potential change in net interest revenue over time using multiple interest rate scenarios. The base scenario assumes the most likely estimate of future interest rate increases and balance sheet changes and is the scenario from which others are compared. Policy limits are based on immediate rate shock scenarios which are compared to the base scenario. While the primary policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame, longer time horizons are also modeled. In addition, management reviews the impact of various yield curve scenarios on earnings and cash flows. Our policy states that an immediate and sustained 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not negatively impact net interest income by more than 10%.\nWe believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements and contractual obligations. Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on liquidity levels. Our Board of Directors reviews liquidity benchmarks quarterly. Also, we review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position\nALCO monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in portfolio values and net interest income with changes in interest rates. The primary purposes of ALCO are to manage our interest rate risk consistent with earnings and liquidity, to effectively invest our capital, and to preserve the value created by our core business operations. In addition, our exposure to interest rate risk is compared to established tolerances on at least a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.\nOn August 20, 2007, we issued $20.0 million in fixed-floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust III with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest was fixed at 6.62% for five years and converted to a floating rate, which adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, with a rate of 4.19% and 2.99% at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed with regulatory approval at any distribution payment date or at any time upon certain events, such as a change in the regulatory treatment of the trust preferred securities, at the redemption price of 100%.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our cash and liquid securities totaled 10.2% and 7.2% of assets, respectively, providing ample liquidity to support our existing operations. In addition to cash and liquid securities, as of December 31, 2018, we had the following sources of available unused liquidity:\nOur ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, which typically includes some level of federal funds sold, cash balances at the FRB, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; being in a well-capitalized position; and having profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt the Bank's desired liquidity position at any time. Under such circumstances, our federal funds sold position, or cash balances at the FRB, if any, serve as the primary sources of immediate liquidity.\nWe are required under federal regulations to maintain adequate liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. As such, management regularly evaluates the investment portfolio for cash flows, the level of loan production, current interest rate risk strategies and the potential future direction of market interest rate changes. Over the longer term, the size and composition of the investment securities portfolio will reflect balance sheet trends, our overall liquidity objectives, and interest rate risk management objectives. Accordingly, the size and composition of the investment securities portfolio could change over time. Individual investment securities differ in terms of default, interest rate, liquidity and expected rate of return risk. We maintain a relatively high percentage of the investment securities portfolio as available-for-sale to meet possible liquidity needs including pledging as collateral for public deposits and borrowings. The held-to-maturity investment securities are primarily utilized for pledging as collateral for public deposits. Investment security cash-flow reinvestment and additional investment may occur as interest rates increase in the foreseeable future.\nNoninterest Expense\nPerforming loans are treated as homogeneous pools and the allowance for loan losses for these loans is based on historical net charge-off rates adjusted for current trends in qualitative factors. Nonperforming and substandard loans, typically commercial and construction loans with outstanding balances exceeding $50,000, as well as certain other performing loans with greater than normal credit risk characteristics, are not treated as homogeneous pools and are instead individually reviewed for a specific allowance. The specific allowance for these individually reviewed loans is based on a specific loan impairment analysis based on the latest appraised value using independent appraisers, trends of similar property values within our market areas and our own observations and experience with similar properties. The unallocated portion of the allowance reflects a margin for the imprecision inherent in estimates of the range of the probable credit losses.\nWe included the $45.0 million of trust preferred securities in our Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2018 and 2017 as an element of restricted core capital. Restricted core capital elements are subject to an aggregate 25% of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill limitation, as defined by the regulatory risk-based capital standards for bank holding companies. These standards also require that trust preferred securities be excluded from Tier 1 capital within five years of the maturity of the underlying junior subordinated notes issued. Our first junior subordinated note matures in June 2033.\nManagement's policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries, net of amounts due from the FDIC under the loss sharing agreements for our past FDIC-assisted transactions. The provision for loan losses is subject to a quarterly review process which incorporates trends in factors such as historical credit losses, delinquencies, level of nonperforming loans, loan growth, composition of the loan portfolio, etc. combined with management's view on qualitative factors such as economic conditions, loan concentrations, etc.\nThe primary tool management uses to estimate and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is an asset/liability simulation model. Resulting estimates are based on a number of assumptions for each scenario, including the level of balance sheet growth, loan and deposit repricing characteristics, and the rate of prepayment. Additionally, the fair value of our MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in market implied interest rate volatility. ALCO periodically reviews the assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations; however, actual net interest income may differ from model results.\nManaging the levels of total liquidity, short-term liquidity, and short-term liquidity sources continues to be an important and complex exercise because of the coordination of the projected mortgage, SBA and indirect automobile loan production and sales, loans held-for-sale balances, and individual loans and pools of loans sold anticipated to fluctuate during the year. We also have fluctuating obligations related to our portfolio of loans serviced for others such as advances we are obligated to make to\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2017 and 2016 was 0.83% and 0.90%, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding, excluding acquired loans, at the end of 2017 and 2016 was 0.88% and 0.99%, respectively. The improvement in asset quality over the past several years has offset the need for a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans as a result of loan growth in 2017.\nInvestment Securities\nNoninterest income from mortgage banking activities increased by $4.3 million, or 4.3%, to $103.1 million in 2018, compared to $98.8 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a MSR's valuation recovery of $4.7 million in 2018, as interest rates increased over the year. Mortgage loan production for the year increased from $2.8 billion in 2017 to $2.9 billion in 2018, a $120.5 million, or 4.3%, year over year change. Increased production led to an increase in the volume of residential mortgage loans sold from $2.6 billion in 2017 to $2.8 billion in 2018, a $164.9 million, or 6.4%, year over year change. Gain on sales of mortgage loans decreased by $8.0 million, or 10.4%, year over year, from $76.4 million in 2017 to $68.5 million in 2018. Decreased gains on mortgage loan sales were partially offset by an increase in mortgage servicing revenue $2.9 million, or 13.2%, to $25.1 million in 2018, compared to $22.2 million in 2017 as the portfolio of loans serviced for others grew by $390.4 million or 4.4%, in 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amount of total loans by loan type:\nExcluding the effects of the one-time tax benefit recorded to revalue the net deferred tax liability and the benefit of discrete items recorded during the quarter for employee stock option exercises, the effective tax rate was 38.2% in 2017 compared to 36.4% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 is primarily driven by an increase in permanent unfavorable book/tax differences as a percentage of pretax book income, mainly related to vesting of restricted stock grants.\nOverview\nResults of Operations - 2017 Compared to 2016\nAt December 31, 2018, the gross pipeline of interest rate lock commitments was $225.7 million, a $21.8 million, or 10.7%, increase from December 31, 2017.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $149.7 million in 2018 compared to $135.5 million in 2017, an increase of $14.2 million, or 10.5%. Average interest-earning assets in 2018 increased by $270.4 million to $4.4 billion, a 6.5% increase, when compared to 2017. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $96.8 million to $3.1 billion, a 3.2% increase. The net interest margin increased by 12 basis points to 3.38% in 2018 when compared to 2017. The primary components of our net interest income and margin are described below.\n\n (3) Subordinated debt is comprised of three trust preferred security issuances and subordinated notes. We have no obligations related to the trust preferred security holders other than to remit periodic interest payments and to remit principal and interest due at maturity. Each trust preferred security provides us with the opportunity to prepay the securities at specified dates from inception at par after designated periods for all issues. \nThe table below presents the allocated loan loss allowance by loan type as of December 31, 2018, and 2017:\nWe have accounted for our acquisitions as business combinations. As such, the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, as well as for specific disclosures. The calculation of fair value of loans and foreclosed property acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than for the remainder of acquired assets or assumed liabilities.\nThe interest rate characteristics of our short-term borrowings are presented in the table below:\n\nWe recorded net income of $43.8 million in 2018 compared to $39.8 million in 2017, an increase of $4.0 million, or 10.1%. Both net income per basic and diluted common share were $1.61 for 2018, and $1.50 and $1.49, respectively, for 2017. An increase of $14.3 million, or 10.6%, in net interest income, an increase in noninterest income of $3.9 million or 2.9% and a decrease in income tax expense of $1.5 million or 9.8%, were partially offset by an increase of $14.4 million, or 6.8%, in noninterest expense and an increase of $1.2 million or 29.1% in the provision for loan losses.\nTotal assets grew to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $156.9 million, or 3.4%, compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in cash of $26.0 million, and an increase in investments securities available-for-sale of $131.5 million as the we repositioned our balance sheet to higher yielding investments over the year.\n \u2022 Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services.  Management seeks to maintain a stable net liquidity position while optimizing operating results, as reflected in net interest income, the net yield spread on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in particular. We deploy our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs.\nIncluded in nonaccrual loans are $29.1 million and $19.5 million in government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These loans are collateralized by first mortgages on the underlying real estate collateral and are individually reviewed for a specific allowance. The Company's loss exposure on the repurchased government-guaranteed loans is mitigated by the government guarantee in whole or in part.\n \u2022 Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us; \nFair Value Adjustments\nIn addition, FSC filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on May 5, 2017 for up to $100 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, or debt securities, to be issued from time to time for general corporate purposes which may include funding bank and non-bank subsidiaries, financing business expansion, or refinancing or extending the maturity of debt obligations and investments at the holding company level. The amount was available to be issued as of June 15, 2017, which was the date that the SEC issued a Notice of Effectiveness. As of December 31, 2018, we have not issued any securities under the shelf registration statement and, due to the pending merger, we do not anticipate issuing any securities under this registration statement.\nNet Income\nBank owned life insurance income increased by $2.5 million compared to prior year primarily due to a non recurring $2.6 million death benefit received from cash surrender value life insurance policies in 2018.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nSalaries and benefits expense increased by $10.2 million, or 9.8%, in 2018, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries and employee benefits associated with employee incentives due to performance and related to the balance sheet strategies implemented earlier in the year, and from a comparison perspective, no executive incentives were paid in 2017.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $446.2 million and $401.6 million, respectively. The $44.6 million increase in shareholders' equity over December 31, 2017 was attributable to net income earned of $43.8 million, and common\nORE, consisting of properties obtained through acquisition, foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans, is initially reported at fair value, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Management also considers other factors, including changed economic conditions since the last appraisal, changes in absorption rates, stale appraisals or imprecision and subjectivity of the appraisal process, length of time the property has been on the market and anticipated sales values, which have resulted in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in certain appraisals.\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\nNoninterest income for 2017 was $135.0 million compared to $141.3 million in 2016, a $6.4 million, or 4.5% decrease. This decrease was primarily a result of decreases in mortgage banking, indirect lending, and SBA lending activities as noted below.\nSince our inception in 1973, we have pursued managed profitable growth through providing quality financial services. Our overall focus is on building shareholder value. Our mission is to continue growth, improve earnings and increase shareholder value; to treat customers, employees, community and shareholders according to the \"Golden Rule\"; and to operate within a culture of strong internal controls.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n\nYear over year balance sheet changes and assumption updates have slightly increased net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The rate shock analysis at December 31, 2018 indicated that all of the scenarios would fall within policy parameters and approved tolerances for net interest income and EVE at risk. If large downward shocks were to occur from today's low rates, increased MSR modeled impairment may breach net income benchmarks.\nIncome tax expense was $1.5 million, or 9.8%, lower in 2018 than in 2017, as a result of the rate change following the enactment on December 22, 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent as of the beginning of the tax year 2018.\n\nLoans accruing delinquent 30-89 days increased by $2.7 million at December 31, 2018, to $24.7 million compared to $22.1 million at December 31, 2017, mainly due to increases in 30-89 days delinquencies in the mortgage loan and construction loan portfolios over the year. Of the $12.6 million in 30-89 day delinquencies in the mortgage loan portfolio, $9.2 million were only past due 30 days primarily due to timing of month end in December.\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans (including repurchased government guaranteed loans), loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, repossessions, and other real estate (\"ORE\"). Nonaccrual loans are loans on which the interest accruals have been discontinued when it appears that future collection of principal or interest according to the contractual terms may be doubtful. Troubled debt restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been modified, because of economic or legal\nInterest expense in 2017 increased by $2.3 million, or 11.2%, to $22.7 million, primarily as the result of a $107.0 million, or 3.7%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances and, to a lesser degree, a 5 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for 2017 was primarily due to the growth in interest bearing demand and money market deposits of $257.7 million as Fidelity had a successful advertising campaign in Florida during 2017 to attract new demand and money market deposits.\nOn March 17, 2005, we issued $10.0 million in floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust II with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.89%, with a rate of 4.68% and 3.49% at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\n\nCredit Quality\nResults of Operations - 2018 Compared to 2017\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REVIEW\n \u2022 Pricing deposits, including CD's, at rate levels that will sustain balances at levels that will enhance our asset liability management and net interest margin requirements; and \nVisa Class B Stock\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of loans held for investment at December 31, 2018 with maturity dates after one year and their general repricing characteristics:\nFHLB borrowing capacity is based on the lower of 25% of assets or pledged loans' lendable collateral value less outstanding advance balances. As of December 31, 2018, there was $590.7 million FHLB capacity with $125.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding, additionally, there was $92.0 million brokered CD's outstanding with remaining capacity of $493.6 million. We hold investments in FHLB stock for the purposes of maintaining credit lines with the FHLB.\nTime deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 were $176.7 million and $178.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe acquisition of AEB in March 2016 resulted in the recording of $5.2 million in goodwill. We review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\ninvestors to fund scheduled principal, interest, tax and insurance payments that mortgage loan borrowers have failed to make, to cover foreclosure costs and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced. These servicer advance obligations require capital and liquidity to fund these advances until we are contractually authorized to be reimbursed from the loan investors. While the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors, one of the primary goals of ALCO is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in both normal operating conditions and in periods of internal or industry stress.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding (i) the total dollar amount of interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rate; (iii) net interest income; (iv) net interest spread; and (v) net interest margin. The average balances are principally daily averages, and, for loans, include both performing and non-performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion on acquired loans and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments.\nThe following table summarizes the results of a 12-month forecasting period of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of 100 and 200 basis points in market interest rates as of December 31, 2018, and 2017:\nServicing rights are tested for impairment on at least a quarterly basis based on fair value. Management uses a model operated and maintained by an independent third party to assist in determining fair value which stratifies the servicing portfolio into homogeneous subsets with unique behavior characteristics. The model then converts those characteristics into income and expense streams, adjusts those streams for prepayments, present values the adjusted streams, and combines the present values into a total. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, prepayment speeds, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold servicing retained, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received. Management periodically obtains an independent review of the valuation assumptions to validate the fair value estimate and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in measuring fair value.\nFair Value\n (2) Collateralized with investment grade securities or with pledged real estate loans. \nAt the time of acquisition, foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the allowance for loan losses. After the transfer to ORE, the fair value, less estimated selling costs, becomes the new cost basis for the ORE. Subsequent declines in the fair value of ORE, below the new cost basis are recognized by a charge to income.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, including loan portfolio concentrations, current economic conditions, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance.\nWe have continued to focus on organic growth and building meaningful presence and relationships in Georgia and northern, eastern and central Florida. We believe our retail branch network positions us to generate new customers and business opportunities.\n\nStandby and import letters of credit are commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans or lines of credit to customers. We hold collateral supporting those commitments as deemed necessary.\nOn May 29, 2015, the Bank issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (the Notes\u201d). The Notes are due May 31, 2030 and bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.875% per year until May 31, 2025. From June 1, 2025 to the maturity date, the interest rate will be a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 363 basis points. The Bank incurred approximately $1.1 million of acquisition costs in connection with the debt issuance. The Notes were priced at 100% of their par value. We can call the Notes at their par value in whole or in part on June 1, 2025 or any interest payment date thereafter. The Notes contain certain restrictions on the merger or consolidation of the Company or the sale or transfer of its assets into another entity. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 regulatory capital for the Bank and the Company.\n(2) Excludes GNMA and SBA guaranteed loans and acquired loans. See non-GAAP reconciliation table for a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure.\nOn May 28, 2015, the U.S. Treasury sold its warrant in a private transaction with two unaffiliated third-party investors.\nAverage nonperforming assets were $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $62.0 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $5.1 million or 8.3%.\nMarket Risk\nand our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulator. We also maintain various wholesale sources of funding and expect our interest cost to vary based on the range of interest rates charged.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe provision for loan losses was $4.3 million in 2017 and $8.2 million in 2016. Net charge-offs were flat at $4.2 million in 2017 and in 2016. The decrease in the provision in 2017, compared to 2016 was primarily due to continued improvement in asset quality in 2017.\nRate shock analysis provides only a limited, point in time view of interest rate sensitivity. The actual impact of interest rate changes upon earnings and net present value may differ from that implied by any rate shock. In addition, net interest income and net present value under various future interest rate scenarios are affected by multiple other factors not embodied in a rate shock, including competition, changes in the shape of the Treasury yield curve, divergent movement among various interest rate indices, and the speed with which interest rates change.\nThe following table summarizes scheduled remaining maturities for time deposits in denominations of $100,000 and greater as of December 31, 2018:\nWe account for the discount on loans which do not have a discount materially attributable to credit or revolving type loans by accreting the discount on each individual loan over time using a level yield approach based on the contractual cash flows for term loans or on a straight-line basis for revolving loans. The methodology also considers the remaining fair value discounts recognized upon acquisition associated with purchased non-impaired loans in estimating a general allowance and also includes establishing an ALL for purchased credit-impaired loans that have deteriorated in credit quality since acquisition.\nThe categories of our noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:\nProfessional and other services also increased by $3.1 million, or 20.5%, primarily due to increased expenses paid to vendors for infrastructure improvement projects and costs associated with new and existing regulations. Fidelity remains committed to implementing changes to operations and technology that will enable the Bank to be more efficient and effective in its growth strategies.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, Fidelity's shareholders will have the right to receive 0.80 shares (the Exchange Ratio\u201d) of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Ameris Common Stock for each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Fidelity Common Stock that they hold, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares.\n\nRate/Volume Variance Analysis\nRevenue from ORE operations as well as gains or losses on sales is recorded as a component of noninterest income. Expenses from ORE operations are recorded as a component of noninterest expense.\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2017 and 2016, was $15.3 million and $22.1 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 27.7% and 36.4%, respectively. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, Fidelity remeasured its net deferred tax liability position to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This revaluation resulted in a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $4.9 million in 2017.\nInterest Rate and Maturity Distribution of Borrowings\nThe following management discussion and analysis addresses important factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the periods indicated. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with this review.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nCredit quality risk in the loan portfolio provides our highest degree of risk. We manage and control risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to standards established by the Board of Directors and senior management, combined with a commitment to producing quality assets, monitoring loan performance, developing profitable relationships, and meeting the strategic loan quality and growth targets. Our credit policies establish underwriting standards, place limits on exposures, which include concentrations and commitments, and set other limits or standards as deemed necessary and prudent. Also included in the policy, primarily determined by the amount and type of loan, are various approval levels, ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized.\nAt December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses was $31.2 million, or 0.85% of loans, compared to $29.8 million, or 0.83% of loans, at December 31, 2017. The allowance (excluding acquired and indirect allowance) to adjusted loans (excluding acquired and indirect loans), a non-GAAP measure, was 1.12% at December 31, 2018 compared to 1.16% at December 31, 2017. Management uses this measure to provide better visibility into the allowance as part of its strategic initiative to de-emphasize indirect loans and grow loans in categories other than indirect, mainly commercial, construction and SBA. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding during each respective period were 0.11% in 2018, a slight decrease as compared to 0.12% for 2017.\nInvestment securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2018 increased by $131.5 million, or 109.5%, from December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in residential mortgage-backed securities investments of $135.2 million, partially offset by small decreases in other categories. Investment securities available for sale at December 31, 2017 decreased by $24.2 million, or 16.8%, over December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of securities being called during the year.\nIn December 2008, as part of the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, the U.S. Treasury purchased 48,200 shares of the Company's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Stock\u201d), and a warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $48.2 million in cash. On June 27, 2012, the Treasury sold all of its shares of the Company's Preferred Stock in a public offering as part of a modified Dutch auction process. The Company did not receive any proceeds from this auction.\nFor information relating to recent accounting standards and pronouncements, see Footnote 1 to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements entitled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nDuring 2016 and 2015, we received Warrant exercise notices for cash and cashless exercises, resulting in the issuance of 1,000,000 and 1,487,487 shares of common stock, respectively. In 2016, all exercises were cash exercises for aggregate proceeds of $2.7 million, resulting in the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of common stock. During 2016, 1,346,873 equivalent shares exercised were cashless, resulting in the issuance of 1,140,614 shares of common stock and cash exercise aggregated $931,354, resulting in the issuance of 346,873 shares of common stock.\nliabilities are amortized over the expected lives of the serviced loans utilizing the interest method. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received.\nIn particular, management uses tangible shareholders' equity, adjusted allowance for loan losses, adjusted nonperforming assets, adjusted nonperforming loans, adjusted total loans, and related ratios, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses (i) tangible shareholders' equity (which exclude goodwill and other intangibles from equity) and related ratios to evaluate the adequacy of shareholders' equity and to facilitate comparisons with peers; and (ii) adjusted allowance for loan losses (which includes adjustments related to acquired loans and indirect auto loans), adjusted non-performing assets and adjusted loans (which includes adjustments for repurchased government-guaranteed loans, SBA guaranteed loans and acquired loans) as supplemental information to evaluate both asset quality and asset quality trends, and to facilitate comparisons with peers. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP finance measures to their nearest GAAP measure appears in the following table:\nTotal loans, which include loans held for investment and loans held-for-sale, decreased by $13.9 million, or 0.4%, at December 31, 2018 over December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in indirect auto loans of $221.9 million, as Fidelity exited all markets except Florida and Georgia. This decrease was offset by growth in all other loan categories, particularly commercial and residential mortgage. The loan portfolio is the largest component of our earning assets. The volume of loans is a key driver of our net interest margin as loans typically product higher yields than investment securities and other earning assets. Our strategy is to grow loans in all categories by originating loans that we believe to be of high quality that comply with our conservative credit policies with terms that produce revenues that meet our financial objectives.\nValuation of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Purchase Accounting Adjustments\nA formal review of the allowance for loan losses is prepared quarterly to assess the probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. For purposes of management's review, the loan portfolio is separated by loan type. The level of allowance required for each loan type is determined based upon historical charge-off experience and current internal and external qualitative factors. Acquired purchased credit-impaired (\"PCI\") loans are evaluated for impairment each quarter and if a pool is impaired, an allowance for loan loss is recorded.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nIn addition to traditional measures, management provides information it considers useful to investors in understanding the Company's operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of its peers. Management also uses these measures internally to assess and better understand the Company's underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators used by the Company may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and performance indicators used by other financial institutions to assess their performance and trends.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $135.5 million in 2017 compared to $129.4 million in 2016, an increase of $6.1 million, or 4.7%. Average interest-earning assets in 2017 increased by $259.9 million to $4.2 billion, a 6.7% increase when compared to 2016. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $107.0 million to $3.0 billion, a 3.7% increase. The net interest margin decreased by 6 basis points to 3.26% in 2017 when compared to 2016. The primary components of our net interest income and margin are described below.\nThe Credit Review Department ( Credit Review\u201d) regularly reports to senior management and the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as well as trends in the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Credit Review monitors loan concentrations, production, loan growth, as well as loan quality, and independent from the lending departments, reviews risk ratings and tests credits approved for adherence to our lending standards. Finally, Credit Review also performs ongoing, independent reviews of the risk management process and adequacy of loan documentation. The results of its reviews are reported to the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors. The consumer collection function is centralized and automated to ensure timely collection of accounts and consistent management of risks associated with delinquent accounts.\nInterest expense in 2018 increased by $9.2 million, or 40.3%, to $31.9 million, primarily as the result of a $96.8 million, or 3.2%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances and a 27 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of $109.7 million, offset by a slight decrease in average deposits of $13.0 million.\nExcluding the effects of the one-time tax benefit recorded to revalue the net deferred tax liability and the benefit of discrete items recorded for employee stock option exercises, the effective tax rate was 23.9% in 2018 compared to 38.2% in 2017.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2018 and 2017 was 0.85% and 0.83%, respectively. The slight increase is mainly due to increases in provision for loan losses from increased commercial loan balances.\nNoninterest expense increased by $9.9 million, or 4.9%, in 2017 to $210.9 million compared to 2016, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits and to increases in professional and other services.\nSubordinated Debt\nLoan servicing rights increased by $7.8 million, or 6.9%, to $120.4 million at December 31, 2018, compared to December 31, 2017. MSRs, the primary component of loan servicing rights, contributed the majority of the change, increasing by $10.7 million or 10.7%, to $111.4 million, offset primarily by decreasing indirect auto servicing rights of $2.7 million at December 31, 2018. The current estimated fair market value of MSRs was $116.8 million at December 31, 2018.\nOur liabilities also provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposits and certain interest-sensitive deposits, brokered deposits, available unsecured overnight federal funds lines from correspondent banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings such as a collateralized line of credit at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta ( FRB\u201d) Discount Window and a collateralized line of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB\u201d).\ngenerally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nForeclosed assets are adjusted to fair value less estimated selling costs upon transfer of the loans to ORE, which becomes the new carrying value of the ORE. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral, sales agreements, or management's estimation of the value of the collateral using market data including recent sales activity for similar assets in the property's market. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 3. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the property. Management continues to evaluate the appropriateness of appraised values on at least an annual basis.\nTrust and wealth management fees increased by $1.0 million to $2.3 million in 2018 compared to $1.3 million in prior year. We have expanded our Wealth Management business and team since 2017 with the addition of client advisors, and assets under management have continued to grow in 2018.\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $23.4 million for 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in our interest income primarily occurred due to the net growth of $270.4 million, or 6.5%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio, as well as an increase in yield on loans of 21 basis points, primarily in the commercial, construction, and mortgage loan portfolios, including an increase of 3 basis points attributable to accretable yield.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nWe use our borrowing capability with the FHLB as our primary funding source for borrowings. We enter into FHLB advances with terms that are consistent with our interest rate risk position at the time we enter into each advance. Our FHLB advances mature in less than one year and are collateralized with qualifying residential mortgage, home equity and commercial real estate loans and, from time to time, agency notes or agency mortgage-backed securities.\nThe aggregate principal balance of subordinated debt was $121.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 and consisted of amounts outstanding pursuant to the issuance of subordinated notes and trust preferred securities. The unamortized balance of debt issuance costs is netted against the aggregate principal amount in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Therefore, the balance reported as subordinated debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $120.7 million and $120.6 million, respectively, after netting out unamortized acquisition costs of $686,000 and $806,000, respectively. Related interest expense is reported as Interest expense: Subordinated debt\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n (2) Average yields reflect the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments using a 25% tax rate for 2018 and 35% tax rate for 2017.  Deposits\nInterest rate risk, which encompasses price risk, is the exposure of our financial condition and earnings ability to withstand adverse movements in interest rates. Price and interest rate risks arise from the financial instruments and positions we hold including loans, mortgage servicing rights, investment securities, deposits, borrowings, and derivative financial instruments. Accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value; however, excessive levels of interest rate risk can pose a significant threat to assets, earnings, and capital. Accordingly, effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our success.\nNoninterest income from indirect lending activities decreased by $2.4 million, or 15.9%, as indirect loan production decreased by $208.4 million, or 15.1%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, and indirect sales decreased by $79.3 million, or 15.5% leading to decreased gains on loan sales in 2017 as compared to 2016. Indirect servicing income remained consistent with 2016 at $9.2 million. The decrease in gains occurred due to the industry-wide weakening of the indirect auto loan sales market.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest income from SBA lending activities decreased by $1.1 million or 19.8% in 2017, to $12.5 million, compared to 2016 due to lower sales of SBA loans in 2017, which resulted in lower gain on sales and lower capitalization of servicing rights. SBA servicing income remained consistent with 2016 at $2.5 million.\nThe Bank had $24.6 million in troubled debt restructured loans at December 31, 2018, of which $16.2 million were accruing loans and $8.4 million are on nonaccrual status and are included in nonperforming assets in the table above.\nImpaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired, at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs. A loan is considered impaired if it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due according to the terms of the loan agreement. Measuring the impairment of loans using the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, is not considered a fair value measurement. For collateral-dependent loans, fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans and is classified as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may include real estate or business assets, including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. The value of real estate collateral is determined based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers ordered by our internal appraisal department, which is independent of our lending function. If significant, the value of business equipment is based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers ordered by our internal appraisal department; otherwise, the equipment's net book value on the business's financial statements is the basis for the value of business equipment. Inventory and accounts receivable collateral are valued based on independent field examiner review or aging reports. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.\nThe significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our IRLCs is the pull-through ratio, which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. Generally, the fair value of an IRLC is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the IRLC rate. Therefore, an increase in the pull-through ratio (i.e., higher percentage of loans are estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the IRLC increasing if in a gain position, or decreasing if in a loss position. The pull-through ratio is largely dependent on the processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. The pull-through ratio is computed by the secondary marketing department using historical data and the ratio is reviewed by the Secondary Marketing Department of the Mortgage Banking Division for reasonableness.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nOur loans held for sale are considered highly liquid. The majority of these loans are conforming residential mortgage loans sold to GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. Other categories of loans held for sale include the government-guaranteed portion of SBA loans and the balance of indirect automobile loans purchased from motor vehicle dealers. The portfolio of indirect auto loans held for sale fluctuates based on the demand for loan sales from investors, mainly other financial institutions which has declined in recent years.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur investment securities consisted primarily of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government-sponsored entities (\"GSE's\") which expose us to a low level of credit and liquidity risk. The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at the time periods indicated:\nTotal average deposits for 2018 increased by $129.1 million, or 3.4%, over 2017. Average core deposits for 2018 increased by $235.8 million, or 8.4%, over 2017, primarily due to the above mentioned transaction account acquisition initiative. Average time deposits for 2018 decreased by $106.8 million, or 10.5%, from 2017, as the enhanced core deposit base allowed the Bank to be more relationship-oriented in its approach to time deposits and non-core brokered CD's. Total average deposits for 2017 increased by $364.2 million, or 10.5%, over 2016, with $386.8 million of the increase coming from core deposits. The increase in core deposits was primarily due to organic growth from our transaction account initiatives, including money market promotions that ran primarily in our Florida markets.\nThe following table outlines the changes in our allowance for losses during the five-year period ended December 31, 2018:\nNo less frequently than quarterly, management reviews the status of mortgage loans held-for-sale for which fair value has been elected and pools of servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets results in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nWe file a consolidated federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in several states. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The net deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting period to assess the probability of realization of benefits in future periods and whether valuation allowances are appropriate. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. As the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, we remeasured our net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent from the beginning of the tax year 2018. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is more likely than not\u201d that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. Management has reviewed all evidence, both positive and negative, and concluded that a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset is not needed at December 31, 2018. The calculation of the income tax provision is complex and requires the use of judgments and estimates in its determination.\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements consist of balances in the transaction accounts of our commercial customers swept nightly to an overnight investment account. Securities sold under repurchase agreements are not subject to offset.\nIndirect automobile loans decreased by $146.9 million, or 8.6%, over December 31, 2017 as lower sales volume was noted in 2018 as compared to 2017 as the bank completed its strategy to exit all markets except for Georgia and Florida. Residential mortgage loans increased by $104.4 million, or 21.3%, over December 31, 2017 as solid production in the residential mortgage portfolio continued. Commercial loans increased by $93.0 million, or 11.5%, over December 31, 2017 and construction loans increased by $31.1 million, or 12.5%, compared to December 31, 2017, as we have added new lenders in our strategy to re-balance the portfolio with higher-yielding commercial credits and de-emphasizing indirect auto lending.\nThe following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on management's estimates, assumptions, and judgments.\n\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $43.8 million and we reported $1.61 for the basic and fully diluted earnings per share. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $39.8 million and we reported basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.50 and $1.49, respectively. The $4.0 million increase in net income in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of $14.3 million, and increase in noninterest income of $3.9 million; offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $14.4 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below.\n (1) Financial commitments include both secured and unsecured obligations to fund. Certain residential construction and acquisition and development commitments relate to revolving\u201d commitments whereby payments are received as individual homes or parcels are sold; therefore, the outstanding balances at any one-time will be less than the total commitment. Construction loan commitments in excess of one year have provisions to convert to term loans at the end of the construction period. \nDeposits are a primary source of funding for us and provide us with the ability to successfully meet both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We provide a full range of deposit accounts and services to both individuals and businesses for which we charge reasonable service fees such as monthly account maintenance fees, overdraft fees, etc. While retail deposits are a primary source of funding and provide a customer base for cross-selling additional products and services, we also emphasize commercial accounts as an opportunity for growth and to meet our business customers' needs. We also utilize brokered time deposits as a funding source, although to a lesser degree.\nThe provision for loan losses was $5.5 million in 2018 and $4.3 million in 2017, an increase of $1.2 million or 29.1%, mainly due to increases in commercial loan balances. Net charge-offs were relatively flat at $4.1 million in 2018 and $4.2 million in 2017. Credit quality trend performance remains consistent and strong as net charge-offs were 0.11% of average loans for the year.\n\nManagement reviews the value of ORE on at least a quarterly basis and adjusts the values as appropriate. Generally, a new appraisal is received annually on each ORE property. Any subsequent adjustments to reflect changes in fair value and selling costs are recorded as a component of other noninterest expense or a reduction of any existing valuation allowance on a property by property basis, but not below zero. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy.\nWe sell indirect automobile loan pools, residential mortgages and SBA loans with servicing retained. When the contractual servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. When the expected costs to a servicer for performing loan servicing are not expected to adequately compensate a servicer, a capitalized servicing liability is recognized. Servicing assets and servicing\nThe fair value of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include market trade pricing from brokers and investors and the mortgage-backed security markets. As such, we classify these loans as Level 2.\nThe increase in revenue from other fees and charges of $1.1 million, or 13.3%, stems from an increase in customer accounts, particularly due to the successful marketing campaign in Florida and increasing revenue from debit card and ATM fees in 2018, as compared to 2017.\nWe classify IRLCs on residential mortgage loans held for sale on a gross basis within other liabilities or other assets. The fair value of these commitments, while based on interest rates observable in the market, is highly dependent on the ultimate closing of the loans. These pull-through\u201d rates are based on both our historical data and the current interest rate environment and reflect our best estimate of the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan. The loan servicing value is also included in the fair value of the IRLCs. Because these inputs are not transparent in market trades, we consider IRLCs to be Level 3 assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis. Sources of the Bank's liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities; investment securities eligible for sale or pledging to secure borrowings from customers pursuant to securities sold under agreements to repurchase; loan repayments; loan sales; etc.\nForward commitments are instruments that are used to hedge the value of the IRLC's and mortgage loans held-for-sale. We take investor commitments to sell a loan or pool of newly originated loans to an investor for an agreed upon price for delivery in the future. This type of forward commitment is also known as a mandatory commitment. Generally, the fair value of a forward is negative (positive) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the current commitment interest rate. The value of these commitments is ultimately determined by the investor that sold the commitment and represents a significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our forward commitments.\nIncome Taxes\nNonperforming Assets\nThe categories of noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:\nNoninterest Income\nNet Income\nTrust and wealth management income increased $660,000, or 105.1%, to $1.3 million in 2017 compared to $628,000 in 2016 as Fidelity expanded its Wealth management services with the addition of client advisors in 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nWe mitigate liquidity risk by funding our asset growth with low-cost core deposits. In addition to monitoring our interest rate sensitivity, ALCO also manages our liquidity risk. ALCO meets regularly to review the current and projected net liquidity positions and to review actions taken by management to achieve this liquidity objective. The Board of Directors also reviews performance against internal liquidity benchmarks on at least a quarterly basis.\nManagement's primary objective in managing the investment securities portfolio includes maintaining a portfolio of high quality investments with competitive returns through the employment of excess funds not needed for loan demand or to offset fluctuations in deposits, while providing for pledging and liquidity needs within overall asset and liability management parameters. Our investment activities are governed internally by our Board-approved investment policy and carried out by our Treasury department. Investment strategies are reviewed by the ALCO based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan production and sales, projected funding needs and overall sensitivity to interest rate risk.\nDerivative instruments are primarily transacted in the secondary mortgage and institutional dealer markets and priced with observable market assumptions at a mid-market valuation point, with appropriate valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risk. For purposes of valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, we evaluate liquidity premiums that may be demanded by market participants, as well as the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit if applicable. To date, no material losses due to a counterparty's inability to pay any net uncollateralized position have occurred. Derivative instruments are considered to be Level 3.\n (4) Leases and other rental agreements typically have renewal options either at predetermined rates or market rates on renewal. \nThe increase in revenue from other fees and charges of $738,000, or 9.6%, stems from an increase in customer accounts, particularly due to the successful marketing campaign in Florida and increasing revenue from debit card and ATM fees in 2017, as compared to 2016.\nDetermining the fair value of assets and liabilities, particularly illiquid assets and liabilities, is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair value. Information regarding our loan discount and core deposit intangible asset may be adjusted as we refine our estimates. Purchase price allocations on completed acquisitions may be modified through the measurement date which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date. If we recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period, the amounts will be reported in the period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Fair value adjustments based on updated estimates could materially affect the goodwill, if any, recorded on the acquisition.\nreasons related to the debtors' financial difficulties and provide a concession to the borrower such as, a reduction in principal, change in terms, or modification of interest rates to below market levels. Repossessions include vehicles and other personal property that have been repossessed as a result of payment defaults. ORE is recorded at the lower of cost or market less the estimated cost to sell which is subject to future declines in real estate values. Purchased credit impaired loans are considered to be performing due to the application of the accretion method and are excluded from the table.\nThe increase in nonperforming assets of $8.1 million from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018, primarily resulted from an increase in nonaccrual loans, which increased by $7.7 million from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual residential mortgage loans of $10.3 million. This increase was primarily due to repurchases of government guaranteed loans discussed below.\nMarket risk is defined as the sensitivity of income, fair value measurements and capital to changes in market rates or prices. Our primary market risk exposure is credit risk and, to a lesser extent, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. We have little or no risk related to trading accounts, commodities, or foreign exchange. Our real estate loan portfolio is subject to risks associated with the local economies of our various markets and, in particular, the regional economy of the South.\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $8.4 million for 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in our interest income primarily occurred due to the net growth of $259.9 million, or 6.7%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio, as well as an increase in yield on loans of 5 basis points, primarily in the commercial, construction, and mortgage loan portfolios, including an increase of 3 basis points attributable to accretable yield.\n\nServicing rights are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Servicing fee income, net of amortization of servicing rights, is reported as part of noninterest income from mortgage banking activities, indirect lending activities, and SBA lending activities, as applicable, in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nSchedule of Short-term Borrowings\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe one-time tax benefit recorded during the year to remeasure the net deferred tax liability represents a reasonable estimate determined by management. Any adjustments to provisional amounts determined during the measurement period will be reported as an adjustment to income tax expense or benefit in future periods. In addition, the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability as a result of the rate change does not have any cash flow effect and the change in the tax rate does not impact the time frame when the net deferred tax liability is expected to be settled.\nThe increase in interest expense in 2017 was primarily attributable to average interest-bearing deposits, which increased by $235.2 million, or 9.3%, to $2.8 billion during 2017 compared to 2016, while average borrowings decreased by $128.1 million, or 33.4%, to $254.9 million. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an increase of $257.7 million in interest-bearing money market and demand deposits as mentioned above.\n\nOur accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions, and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies, or conditions significantly different from certain assumptions, could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d Significant accounting policies have been periodically discussed and reviewed with and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors.\nLoans held for investment at December 31, 2018 grew to $3.7 billion, an increase of $104.5 million, or 2.9%, over December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased loan production, particularly in residential mortgage, commercial, and construction loans. In addition, we have exercised our buy-back option on delinquent mortgage loans serviced for GNMA since 2014, adding $24.6 million and $7.5 million in unpaid principal balances in residential mortgage loans held for investment to the portfolio during 2018 and 2017, respectively. We chose to exercise our buy-back option to avoid continuing to advance principal and interest on delinquent mortgage loans previously sold to the investor pool which allows us to work the loans through to resolution using our internal resources.\n\nManagement believes it has been proactive in charging down and charging off nonperforming assets as appropriate. Management's assessment of the overall loan portfolio is that loan quality and performance have improved in recent years, as indicated by the steady decrease in our nonperforming asset ratios. Management is being aggressive in evaluating credit relationships and proactive in addressing problems.\nWe continue to attract new customer relationships, and talented and experienced bankers to support our growth. We are also continuing to focus on asset quality, revenue growth, deposit growth and quality loan growth at a well-maintained capital level.\nThe following schedule provides a summary of our financial commitments to make future payments, primarily to fund loan and other credit obligations, long-term debt, and rental commitments under operating leases of various facilities housing our business development, executive administration and operational support functions as of December 31, 2018. Loan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these commitments are revolving\u201d commitments as discussed below and many are expected to expire unused or partially used, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Payments for borrowings do not include interest. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts.\nAverage Balances, Interest and Yields\nCapitalized Servicing Assets and Liabilities\nTotal deposits of $4.0 billion at December 31, 2018 increased by $114.4 million, or 3.0%, compared to December 31, 2017. Core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing demand accounts and interest-bearing demand accounts, including money market accounts and savings deposits accounted for $111.2 million of the increase, as the result of our continuing transaction account acquisition initiative, in both commercial and consumer accounts. Time deposits at December 31, 2018 increased by $3.2 million, or 0.3%.\nWealth Management began operations in July 2014 when we began offering trust services. We expanded our services and team in 2017 with the addition of client advisors. The Wealth Management division provides trust administration, investment management, financial and estate planning, specialized lending and banking for affluent and high net worth individuals.\nLoans\nNo less frequently than quarterly, management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nNoninterest income for 2018 was $138.9 million compared to $135.0 million in 2017, a $3.9 million, or 2.9% increase. This increase was primarily a result of increases in mortgage banking, SBA lending activities, and bank-owned life insurance income, offset by a decrease in indirect lending, as noted below.\ndiscount. We estimate expected cash flows at each future reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows generally result in a provision for loan losses, net of any amounts due from the FDIC under the applicable loss share agreement. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable discount, which has a positive effect on interest income. We have recorded acquired loans at fair value, exclusive of any amounts due from the FDIC under applicable loss share agreements.\nThe $45.0 million of trust preferred securities issued by our trusts, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Thus, the equity investments in the subsidiaries we created to issue the obligations, the obligations themselves, and related dividend income and interest expense are reported on an unconsolidated basis, with the investments in the amount of $1.4 million at December 31, 2018, and 2017, reported as other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and dividends included as other noninterest income in our Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNoninterest income from indirect lending activities decreased by $7.3 million, or 58.3%, as indirect loan production decreased by $543.9 million, or 46.6%, in 2018 as compared to 2017, and indirect sales decreased by $297.3 million, or 69.0% leading to decreased gains on loan sales in 2018 as compared to 2017. Indirect servicing income decreased by $1.8 million to $7.4 million compared to prior year. The decrease in gains occurred due to the industry-wide weakening of the indirect auto loan sales market, as well as the Company exiting all markets except Georgia and Florida.\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). A financial instrument's level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe average balance of loans outstanding in 2018 increased by $324.7 million, or 8.7%, to $4.1 billion when compared to 2017 as the number of loan originations increased, particularly commercial, construction and mortgage loans. The average balance of investments also increased by $41.9 million as the Bank continues to increase its investments available-for-sale portfolio as part of its strategy to reposition the balance sheet to higher yielding assets, and reduce its reliance on \"gain on sale\" income. The yield on interest-earning assets in 2018 reflected a 30 basis point increase as compared to 2017, as interest rates rose over the year.\nSBA and indirect loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is based on recent trades for similar loan pools as well as offering prices for similar assets provided by buyers in the secondary market. If the cost of a loan is determined to be less than the fair value of similar loans, the impairment is recorded by the establishment of a reserve to reduce the value of the loan.\nThe primary financial instruments we carry at fair value are investment securities, interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans ( IRLCs\u201d), derivative instruments, and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. We also carry certain impaired loans, foreclosed assets and capitalized servicing rights on residential mortgage and SBA loans at fair value.\n(1) The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to the components in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amounts of the change. Average loan volumes include nonperforming loans which result in the impact in the associated lost interest on nonaccrual loans being reflected in the average rate.\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:\nIn addition, due to FSC being a separate entity and apart from the Bank, it must provide for its own liquidity. FSC is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its common and preferred shareholders, and interest and principal on any outstanding debt or trust preferred securities. Substantially all of FSC's cashflow obtained from capital raises and dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiaries, LionMark Insurance Company and the Bank, which are limited by applicable law. In addition, the Bank pays interest to FSC on the Bank's subordinated debt. Under the regulations of the GDBF, bank dividends may not exceed 50% of the prior year's net earnings without approval from the GDBF. If dividends received from the Bank were reduced or eliminated, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\n2018. We do not intend to have indirect auto loan sales in 2019. In addition, a decrease in residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $43.8 million, or 16.3% is the result of slower sales in 2018 compared to 2017.\n\nThe Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d), which is comprised of various senior executives, meets regularly to review our interest rate sensitivity positions and balance sheet mix; monitor our capital position and ratios; review our product offerings and pricing, including rates, fees and charges; monitor our funding needs and sources; and review cash flows to assess our current and projected liquidity. Throughout 2018, we have focused on executing our business strategy to re-balance our loan portfolio with higher-yielding commercial credits and de-emphasize indirect auto lending which is dependent on our growth.\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain consolidated quarterly financial information. This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods. The results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. This information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOn December 17, 2018, Fidelity entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Ameris Bancorp (\"Ameris\"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth, FSC will merge with and into Ameris (the Merger\u201d), in an all-stock transaction, with Ameris surviving the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the Bank will merge (the Bank Merger\u201d) with and into Ameris's wholly owned bank subsidiary, Ameris Bank. Ameris Bank will be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger. The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the board of directors of each of Fidelity and Ameris. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter 2019. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to the approval of FSC's shareholders, regulators, and certain other customary closing conditions.\nOur lending activities are significantly influenced by the local economic environments in the markets we serve. We have grown our consumer installment, mortgage, construction and commercial loan portfolios organically and through acquisitions as the economy continues to improve. Our loan portfolio is well diversified among consumer, business, and real estate lending. The credit quality of the loans we have originated continues to be strong.\nWe manage our assets and liabilities to maximize long-term earnings opportunities while maintaining the integrity of our financial position and the quality of earnings. To accomplish this objective, management strives for efficient management of interest rate risk and liquidity needs. The primary objectives of interest-sensitivity management are to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on the net interest margin and to manage the exposure to risk while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels. Liquidity is provided by our attempt to carefully structure our balance sheet as well as through both unsecured and secured lines of credit with other financial institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the FHLB\u201d), and the FRB.\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and that of financial institutions in general largely determines the access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound credit quality and appropriate levels of capital resources.\nThe following table summarizes average balances and interest rates paid by category for the last three years:", "item_7_text": "(1) Interest income recognized year to date on these loans was approximately $530,000 in 2018 and $455,000 in 2017.\nCommissions increased by $1.6 million in line with the increase in mortgage loan production, primarily due to the increase in mortgage originators and the impact of guaranteed commissions paid to new mortgage originators in expansion markets.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $125.0 million in fixed rate FHLB advances outstanding. In addition, we utilized overnight funding sources of $14.8 million and $25.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in both categories from December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of fluctuations in short-term liquidity needs which the Bank primarily manages through short-term FHLB advances which we chose to utilize as a funding source for loan growth due to the advantageous rates available in comparison to other funding sources.\nAcquisition Accounting\nFinancial Condition\nThere were $2.3 million in loans covered under Loss Share Agreements with the FDIC at December 31, 2017 and no loans covered by Loss Share Agreements in 2018. Of these loans in 2017, $113,000 were past due 90 days or more and $2.3 million were in accrual status due to being in PCI pools.\nThe allocated allowance at December 31, 2018 increased by $1.4 million in comparison to the balance at December 31, 2017 as increases in provision for loan losses were needed to support portfolio growth and the associated qualitative risk factors, specifically with the commercial loan portfolio.\nWe engage in routine activities to retain customer deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following:\nOur franchise primarily spans the metropolitan Atlanta, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tallahassee and Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida markets. We provide banking services and Wealth Management services and credit-related insurance products through branches in Georgia and Florida, and an insurance office in Atlanta, Georgia. Indirect auto loans are provided in Georgia and Florida and mortgage loans are provided throughout the South, while SBA loans are originated nationwide.\nOn June 26, 2003, we issued $15.0 million in Floating Rate Capital Securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust I with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 3.10%. The rates in effect on December 31, 2018 and 2017, were 5.92% and 4.77%, respectively. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\nThe following information regarding short-term borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 pertains to our overnight repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and federal funds purchased. Short-term borrowings have a maturity of one year or less.\nSignificant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of ORE. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of ORE. The period of time within which such estimates can be considered current may be significantly shortened during periods of market volatility.\nWarrant exercises in 2016 and 2015 described below by third-party investors resulted in there being no shares eligible to be purchased pursuant to the Warrant at December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. At December 31, 2015, one investor had a warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, FSC had available cash balances of approximately $10.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively. This cash is available for general corporate purposes, including debt service on subordinated debt outstanding of $46.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, providing capital support to the Bank and potential future acquisitions.\n\nNoninterest expense increased by $14.4 million, or 6.8%, in 2018 to $225.3 million compared to 2017, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, commissions, and other services.\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2018 decreased by $1.6 million, or 7.2%, over December 31, 2017, primarily in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Investment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2017 increased by $5.1 million, or 30.8%, from December 31, 2016, primarily due to additional investment in municipal securities of $7.0 million; partially offset by a decrease in residential mortgage-backed securities of $1.8 million.\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $39.8 million and reported basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.50 and $1.49, respectively. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $38.8 million and reported basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.52 and $1.50, respectively. The $1.0 million increase in net income in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to an increase in interest income of $8.7 million, a decrease in income tax expense of $6.9 million, and a decrease in provision for loan losses of $4.0 million; offset by a decrease in noninterest income of $6.4 million, an increase in noninterest expense of $9.9 million, and an increase in interest expense of $2.3 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below.\n\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2018 and 2017, was $13.8 million and $15.3 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 23.9% and 27.7%, respectively. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, Fidelity remeasured its net deferred tax liability position to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This revaluation resulted in a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $4.9 million in 2017.\nThe average balance of loans outstanding in 2017 increased by $139.1 million, or 3.8%, to $3.8 billion when compared to 2016 as the number of loan originations increased, particularly commercial, construction and mortgage loans. The average balance of Fed funds sold and interest-bearing deposits also increased by $156.7 million or 165.2%, the result of an increase in cash from a successful Florida money market deposit campaign begun in late 2016. The yield on interest-earning assets in 2017 reflected a 4 basis point decrease as compared to 2016.\nWe maintain a diversified loan portfolio intended to spread risk and reduce exposure to economic downturns, which may occur in different segments of the economy or in particular industries. Industry and loan type diversification is reviewed at least quarterly. Management has taken numerous steps to reduce credit risk in the loan portfolio and to strengthen the credit risk management team and processes. In addition, credit policies are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. Experienced managers are in place, strengthening lending areas and Credit Administration.\nIn addition to homogeneous pools of loans, every commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loan is assigned a risk rating using established credit policy guidelines. All nonperforming commercial, commercial real estate, SBA, and construction loans and loans deemed to have greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed monthly by our Credit Review Department to determine the level of additional allowance for loan losses, if any, required to be specifically assigned to these loans.\n\nShareholders' Equity\nManagement divides the portfolio into the following loan categories: commercial, SBA, construction, indirect auto, consumer installment, and residential mortgage. For each loan category, historical loan loss experience, adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of each loan category, current trends, and other factors, is used to determine the level of allowance required. Additional amounts are provided based on the probable losses of individual impaired loans and the effect of economic conditions and other qualitative factors on both individual loans and loan categories. Since the provision is based on estimates and subjective judgment, it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts of losses that may ultimately occur.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Thus, we will deny funding a commitment if the borrower's financial condition deteriorates during the commitment period, such that the customer no longer meets the pre-established conditions of lending. Commitments\n (5) Purchase obligations include significant contractual obligations under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable with initial terms greater than one year. The majority of these amounts are primarily related to salary continuation agreements, and routine services, including core processing systems and telecommunications maintenance.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNoninterest income from mortgage banking decreased by $2.8 million, or 2.7%, to $98.8 million in 2017, compared to $101.6 million in 2016. The year over year decrease was primarily due to decreased mortgage loan production in 2017 compared to 2016 as mortgage lending volume in 2017 was affected by increasing interest rates. Mortgage loan production for the year decreased from $3.0 billion in 2016 to $2.8 billion in 2017, a $194.8 million, or 6.6%, year over year change. Decreased production led to a decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans sold from $2.8 billion in 2016 to $2.6 billion in 2017, a $226.6 million, or 8.0%, year over year change. Lower production and sales decreased gain on sales of mortgage loans, which decreased by $6.1 million or 7.4%, year over year, from $82.5 million in 2016 to $76.4 million in 2017. Decreased gains on mortgage loan sales were partially offset by an increase in mortgage servicing revenue $3.1 million, or 16.1%, to $22.2 million in 2017, compared to $19.1 million in 2016 as the portfolio of loans serviced for others grew by $1.1 billion, or 14.6%, in 2017. Net MSR impairment was $666,000 in 2017 compared to a net MSR recovery of $371,000 in 2016 primarily due to a large recovery in the last half of 2016.\nServicing assets and servicing liabilities are initially recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value when loans are sold with servicing retained with the income statement effect recorded in gains on sales of loans. In evaluating servicing rights and estimating the fair value of the underlying loan pools based on the present value of net future cash flows, we use a number of assumptions and estimates including: prepayment speeds, discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, potential credit losses, and comparable assumptions used by market participants to value and bid servicing rights available for sale in the market. When the contractually specified servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. When the expected income to a servicer for performing loan servicing is not expected to adequately compensate a servicer, a capitalized servicing liability is recognized.\nThe amortized cost, fair value and average yield of investment securities are categorized in the following table by remaining contractual maturity. The amortized cost, fair value and average yield of securities not due at a single maturity (i.e., mortgage-backed securities) are shown separately and are calculated based on estimated remaining average life:\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\nFor our annual goodwill impairment evaluation, management bypassed the qualitative assessment for each respective reporting unit and performed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Accordingly, we determined the fair value of our reporting unit and compared the fair value to the reporting unit's carrying amount. We determined that our reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying amount; therefore, we concluded our goodwill was not impaired. No events have occurred since the last annual goodwill impairment assessment that would necessitate an interim goodwill impairment assessment. For additional information on goodwill, see Note 2: Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures frequently are used by shareholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. We encourage readers to consider the Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. If the cost basis of any loan stratification tranche is higher than the present value of the tranche, an impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance which reduces servicing rights on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and reduces noninterest income from mortgage banking activities, indirect lending activities, and SBA lending activities, as applicable, in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe provision for loan losses was $5.5 million in 2018 and $4.3 million in 2017, an increase of $1.2 million, primarily due to the increase in the commercial loan portfolio and the associated qualitative risk factor. Net charge-offs were relatively flat from the previous year at $4.1 million in 2018 and $4.2 million in 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs of December 31, 2018, we owned 46,436 shares of Class B common stock of Visa, Inc. We received these Class B shares in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A shares. This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which is indemnified by Visa members. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Should this escrow account not be sufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank's Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares. Effective June 28, 2018, the conversion rate for each Class B common share decreased to 1.6298 shares of Class A common stock. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the covered litigation, the Visa Class B shares (75,681 Class A equivalent shares) that we own are carried at a zero cost basis as of December 31, 2018.\nOn May 5, 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of up to $100 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, or debt securities, to be issued from time to time for general corporate purposes which may include funding bank and non-bank subsidiaries, financing business expansion, or refinancing or extending the maturity of debt obligations and investments at the holding company level. The amount was available to be issued as of June 15, 2017, which was the date that the SEC issued a Notice of Effectiveness. As of December 31, 2018, we have not issued any securities under the shelf registration statement and, due to the merger with Ameris; we do not anticipate issuing any securities under the shelf registration.\nIn 2018, net charge-offs totaled $4.1 million, a slight decrease of $37,000, or 0.9%, as compared to 2017. Net charge-offs decreased in the commercial and consumer portfolios, due to fewer charge-offs and/or higher recoveries in these portfolios than in the previous year. The decreases in net charge-offs in these portfolios were offset by higher charge-offs in the SBA and mortgage portfolios and lower recoveries in the construction portfolio.\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\nThe decrease in other miscellaneous income of $301,000, or 15.0%, from 2016 was caused by a $984,000 reduction in insurance commissions on policies sold on indirect auto loans reflecting decreased premium and increased losses which reduced contingent commissions and a $706,000 decrease in ORE gains. offset by an increase of $1.0 million resulting from a non-recurring gain related to the change in insurance providers during 2017, a $276,000 reduction in amortization on the FDIC indemnification asset due to expiring loss share agreements in 2017 and a $138,000 increase in gain on sale of fixed assets.\nWe account for our acquisitions as business combinations, which require the use of the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values, which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques. The determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective, as is the appropriate amortization method for such intangible assets.\nOther operating expenses were $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $891,000, or 2.4%, decrease compared to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is a result of decreases in OREO expenses and writedowns due to fewer OREO properties in 2017 compared to 2016.\nInvestment securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, we obtain fair value measurements from an independent third party pricing service. We have processes in place to evaluate such third party pricing services to ensure information obtained and valuation techniques are appropriate. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond's terms and conditions, among other things. The investments in our portfolio are generally not quoted on an exchange but are actively traded in the secondary institutional markets.\n\nstock issued under employee programs of $13.3 million during 2018, partially offset by cash dividends declared on common shares during 2018 of $13.0 million.\n\n(2) Reflects fully taxable equivalent adjustments using a Federal Tax rate of 21% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a 35% tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAs discussed in Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are estimated based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio on at least a quarterly basis which are determined based on current economic conditions, loan portfolio concentrations, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off in whole or in part when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequently, recoveries are added to the allowance.\nAt December 31, 2018, fair value adjustments recorded on the balance sheet for loans held-for-sale, interest rate lock commitments (\"IRLCs\"), and hedge items were $8.8 million, a $1.5 million, or 15.0% decrease, from December 31, 2017.\nAverage nonperforming assets were $74.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $56.9 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of $17.6 million, or 30.9%, primarily due to the increase in nonaccrual loans, particularly the increase in nonaccrual residential mortgage loans of $10.3 million. This increase was primarily due to repurchases of government guaranteed loans.\n\nCONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\nWe derive approximately 48% of our revenues from noninterest income sources such as service charges on loan and deposit accounts, fees from other products and services and income from mortgage banking, indirect automobile lending, and SBA lending activities. The majority of the noninterest income earned from these sources is generated from gains on sales of loans including recognition of loan servicing revenue as the majority of loans are sold. The retained servicing obligation generates servicing revenue over the life of the loans sold. The revenue generated from gains on sales of loans and related servicing is partially offset by amortization and possible impairment of the related servicing rights. Servicing rights are amortized in proportion to the estimated future servicing income on the underlying loans sold. Impairment on servicing rights is recorded based on changes in the estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses on the underlying loans sold.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of loans held for investment by remaining scheduled contractual maturity as of December 31, 2018. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity, and overdraft loans are reported as being due within one year or less:\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers, and to reduce our own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments, which include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.\nWe define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations and to meet our financial obligations at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis including repayment of borrowings, anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals by customers. Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital if we are unable to fulfill our obligations as they become due. Liquidity risk can also develop if we fail to timely recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect our ability to obtain adequate funding to continue to operate on a profitable basis.\nThe credit risk associated with the underlying cash flows of instruments carried at fair value was a consideration in estimating the fair value of certain financial instruments. Credit risk was considered in the valuation through a variety of inputs, as applicable, including, the actual default and loss severity of the collateral, and level of subordination. The assumptions used to estimate credit risk incorporated relevant information that a market participant would likely use in valuing an instrument. Because mortgage loans held-for-sale are sold within a few weeks of origination, they are unlikely to demonstrate any of the credit weaknesses discussed above and as a result, there have been no credit related adjustments to fair value.\n (1) Weighted average yields are calculated on the basis of the amortized cost of the security. \nWe segregate loans acquired between loans for which there was a discount related, in part, to credit and loans for which there was not a material discount attributable to credit. Subsequent to the acquisition date, decreases in expected cash flows compared to initial estimates on the loans for which there was a credit discount are recognized as impairment through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in cash flows (in a loan pool where an allowance for loan losses on acquired loans was previously recorded) reduces the remaining allowance for loan losses on acquired loans before recalculating the amount of accretable yield percentage to be used going forward for the loan pool.\nEvaluating our exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process we use to control interest rate risk and our quantitative levels of exposure. When assessing the interest rate risk management process, we seek to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems, and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity. Evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure\nThe trust preferred securities were sold in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and were not registered under the Securities Act. The payments to the holders of trust preferred securities are fully tax deductible.\nLiquidity\n(1) Interest income includes the effect of taxable-equivalent adjustment using a 21% tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a 35% tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nLoans held-for-sale at December 31, 2018 decreased by $118.5 million, or 33.1%, over December 31, 2017. The indirect auto portfolio held-for-sale balance decreased by $75.0 million to zero, as only one loan sale occurred during the second half of\nOther operating expenses were $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $2.8 million, or 7.8%, increase compared to $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily related to $1.6 million increase in lending related expenses coupled with the recently announced merger related expenses.\n\nOther Real Estate ( ORE\u201d)\n(1) Percentage of the carrying value of the respective loan type to total loans.\nFinancial Performance\nWe also use the simulation model to calculate the sensitivity of the economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) under various interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of assets less the net present value of liabilities, net of any impact due to derivatives.\n\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nBecause we record acquired loans at fair value, we recorded no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans on the acquisition date, given that the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value estimates associated with the acquired loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\n \u2022 Offer rate specials on Certificates of Deposit (\"CD's\") and other deposit promotional offerings to attract new deposit relationships and fund balance sheet growth; \nThe credit risks inherent and evidenced in our acquisitions have resulted in a portion of the loans purchased in those transactions having a credit discount. On the date of acquisition, when the loans had evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and we believed it was probable that we would not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, we refer to the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected as the non-accretable\nSalaries and benefits expense increased by $6.7 million, or 6.9%, in 2017, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries and employee benefits associated with the net addition of 110 full-time equivalent employees during 2017, primarily due to organic growth in the mortgage and Wealth Management divisions, and expense related to our operational excellence initiative launched earlier in the year. Commissions increased by $666,000 despite the slight decrease in mortgage loan production, primarily due to the increase in mortgage originators and the impact of guaranteed commissions paid to new mortgage originators in expansion markets.\nNoninterest income from SBA lending activities increased by $2.2 million, or 48.2%, in 2018, to $5.2 million, compared to 2017 due to an increase of SBA loans sales by $19.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017, which resulted in higher gain on sales. SBA servicing income decreased by $298,000 in 2018 to $2.2 million compared to prior year.\nWhen a loan is classified as nonaccrual, to the extent collection is in question, previously accrued interest is reversed and interest income is reduced by the interest accrued in the current year, in which case interest advanced to the investor pool prior to the buyback of government guaranteed loans discussed above is not reversed but is capitalized for future reimbursement as part of the government guarantee. For 2018, the gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans, if all such loans had been accruing interest at the original contract rate, was approximately $1.9 million compared to $2.2 million and $1.6 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. For additional information on nonaccrual loans see Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\n\nrequires us to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity, and, where appropriate, asset quality.\nOur exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by customers for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for recorded loans. Loan commitments and other off-balance sheet exposures are evaluated by the Credit Review department quarterly and reserves are provided for risk as deemed appropriate.\n\nThe primary objective of the simulation model is to measure the potential change in net interest revenue over time using multiple interest rate scenarios. The base scenario assumes the most likely estimate of future interest rate increases and balance sheet changes and is the scenario from which others are compared. Policy limits are based on immediate rate shock scenarios which are compared to the base scenario. While the primary policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame, longer time horizons are also modeled. In addition, management reviews the impact of various yield curve scenarios on earnings and cash flows. Our policy states that an immediate and sustained 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not negatively impact net interest income by more than 10%.\nWe believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements and contractual obligations. Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on liquidity levels. Our Board of Directors reviews liquidity benchmarks quarterly. Also, we review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position\nALCO monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in portfolio values and net interest income with changes in interest rates. The primary purposes of ALCO are to manage our interest rate risk consistent with earnings and liquidity, to effectively invest our capital, and to preserve the value created by our core business operations. In addition, our exposure to interest rate risk is compared to established tolerances on at least a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.\nOn August 20, 2007, we issued $20.0 million in fixed-floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust III with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest was fixed at 6.62% for five years and converted to a floating rate, which adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, with a rate of 4.19% and 2.99% at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed with regulatory approval at any distribution payment date or at any time upon certain events, such as a change in the regulatory treatment of the trust preferred securities, at the redemption price of 100%.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our cash and liquid securities totaled 10.2% and 7.2% of assets, respectively, providing ample liquidity to support our existing operations. In addition to cash and liquid securities, as of December 31, 2018, we had the following sources of available unused liquidity:\nOur ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, which typically includes some level of federal funds sold, cash balances at the FRB, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; being in a well-capitalized position; and having profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt the Bank's desired liquidity position at any time. Under such circumstances, our federal funds sold position, or cash balances at the FRB, if any, serve as the primary sources of immediate liquidity.\nWe are required under federal regulations to maintain adequate liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. As such, management regularly evaluates the investment portfolio for cash flows, the level of loan production, current interest rate risk strategies and the potential future direction of market interest rate changes. Over the longer term, the size and composition of the investment securities portfolio will reflect balance sheet trends, our overall liquidity objectives, and interest rate risk management objectives. Accordingly, the size and composition of the investment securities portfolio could change over time. Individual investment securities differ in terms of default, interest rate, liquidity and expected rate of return risk. We maintain a relatively high percentage of the investment securities portfolio as available-for-sale to meet possible liquidity needs including pledging as collateral for public deposits and borrowings. The held-to-maturity investment securities are primarily utilized for pledging as collateral for public deposits. Investment security cash-flow reinvestment and additional investment may occur as interest rates increase in the foreseeable future.\nNoninterest Expense\nPerforming loans are treated as homogeneous pools and the allowance for loan losses for these loans is based on historical net charge-off rates adjusted for current trends in qualitative factors. Nonperforming and substandard loans, typically commercial and construction loans with outstanding balances exceeding $50,000, as well as certain other performing loans with greater than normal credit risk characteristics, are not treated as homogeneous pools and are instead individually reviewed for a specific allowance. The specific allowance for these individually reviewed loans is based on a specific loan impairment analysis based on the latest appraised value using independent appraisers, trends of similar property values within our market areas and our own observations and experience with similar properties. The unallocated portion of the allowance reflects a margin for the imprecision inherent in estimates of the range of the probable credit losses.\nWe included the $45.0 million of trust preferred securities in our Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2018 and 2017 as an element of restricted core capital. Restricted core capital elements are subject to an aggregate 25% of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill limitation, as defined by the regulatory risk-based capital standards for bank holding companies. These standards also require that trust preferred securities be excluded from Tier 1 capital within five years of the maturity of the underlying junior subordinated notes issued. Our first junior subordinated note matures in June 2033.\nManagement's policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries, net of amounts due from the FDIC under the loss sharing agreements for our past FDIC-assisted transactions. The provision for loan losses is subject to a quarterly review process which incorporates trends in factors such as historical credit losses, delinquencies, level of nonperforming loans, loan growth, composition of the loan portfolio, etc. combined with management's view on qualitative factors such as economic conditions, loan concentrations, etc.\nThe primary tool management uses to estimate and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is an asset/liability simulation model. Resulting estimates are based on a number of assumptions for each scenario, including the level of balance sheet growth, loan and deposit repricing characteristics, and the rate of prepayment. Additionally, the fair value of our MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in market implied interest rate volatility. ALCO periodically reviews the assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations; however, actual net interest income may differ from model results.\nManaging the levels of total liquidity, short-term liquidity, and short-term liquidity sources continues to be an important and complex exercise because of the coordination of the projected mortgage, SBA and indirect automobile loan production and sales, loans held-for-sale balances, and individual loans and pools of loans sold anticipated to fluctuate during the year. We also have fluctuating obligations related to our portfolio of loans serviced for others such as advances we are obligated to make to\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2017 and 2016 was 0.83% and 0.90%, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding, excluding acquired loans, at the end of 2017 and 2016 was 0.88% and 0.99%, respectively. The improvement in asset quality over the past several years has offset the need for a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans as a result of loan growth in 2017.\nInvestment Securities\nNoninterest income from mortgage banking activities increased by $4.3 million, or 4.3%, to $103.1 million in 2018, compared to $98.8 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a MSR's valuation recovery of $4.7 million in 2018, as interest rates increased over the year. Mortgage loan production for the year increased from $2.8 billion in 2017 to $2.9 billion in 2018, a $120.5 million, or 4.3%, year over year change. Increased production led to an increase in the volume of residential mortgage loans sold from $2.6 billion in 2017 to $2.8 billion in 2018, a $164.9 million, or 6.4%, year over year change. Gain on sales of mortgage loans decreased by $8.0 million, or 10.4%, year over year, from $76.4 million in 2017 to $68.5 million in 2018. Decreased gains on mortgage loan sales were partially offset by an increase in mortgage servicing revenue $2.9 million, or 13.2%, to $25.1 million in 2018, compared to $22.2 million in 2017 as the portfolio of loans serviced for others grew by $390.4 million or 4.4%, in 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amount of total loans by loan type:\nExcluding the effects of the one-time tax benefit recorded to revalue the net deferred tax liability and the benefit of discrete items recorded during the quarter for employee stock option exercises, the effective tax rate was 38.2% in 2017 compared to 36.4% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 is primarily driven by an increase in permanent unfavorable book/tax differences as a percentage of pretax book income, mainly related to vesting of restricted stock grants.\nOverview\nResults of Operations - 2017 Compared to 2016\nAt December 31, 2018, the gross pipeline of interest rate lock commitments was $225.7 million, a $21.8 million, or 10.7%, increase from December 31, 2017.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $149.7 million in 2018 compared to $135.5 million in 2017, an increase of $14.2 million, or 10.5%. Average interest-earning assets in 2018 increased by $270.4 million to $4.4 billion, a 6.5% increase, when compared to 2017. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $96.8 million to $3.1 billion, a 3.2% increase. The net interest margin increased by 12 basis points to 3.38% in 2018 when compared to 2017. The primary components of our net interest income and margin are described below.\n\n (3) Subordinated debt is comprised of three trust preferred security issuances and subordinated notes. We have no obligations related to the trust preferred security holders other than to remit periodic interest payments and to remit principal and interest due at maturity. Each trust preferred security provides us with the opportunity to prepay the securities at specified dates from inception at par after designated periods for all issues. \nThe table below presents the allocated loan loss allowance by loan type as of December 31, 2018, and 2017:\nWe have accounted for our acquisitions as business combinations. As such, the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, as well as for specific disclosures. The calculation of fair value of loans and foreclosed property acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than for the remainder of acquired assets or assumed liabilities.\nThe interest rate characteristics of our short-term borrowings are presented in the table below:\n\nWe recorded net income of $43.8 million in 2018 compared to $39.8 million in 2017, an increase of $4.0 million, or 10.1%. Both net income per basic and diluted common share were $1.61 for 2018, and $1.50 and $1.49, respectively, for 2017. An increase of $14.3 million, or 10.6%, in net interest income, an increase in noninterest income of $3.9 million or 2.9% and a decrease in income tax expense of $1.5 million or 9.8%, were partially offset by an increase of $14.4 million, or 6.8%, in noninterest expense and an increase of $1.2 million or 29.1% in the provision for loan losses.\nTotal assets grew to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $156.9 million, or 3.4%, compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in cash of $26.0 million, and an increase in investments securities available-for-sale of $131.5 million as the we repositioned our balance sheet to higher yielding investments over the year.\n \u2022 Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services.  Management seeks to maintain a stable net liquidity position while optimizing operating results, as reflected in net interest income, the net yield spread on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in particular. We deploy our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs.\nIncluded in nonaccrual loans are $29.1 million and $19.5 million in government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These loans are collateralized by first mortgages on the underlying real estate collateral and are individually reviewed for a specific allowance. The Company's loss exposure on the repurchased government-guaranteed loans is mitigated by the government guarantee in whole or in part.\n \u2022 Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us; \nFair Value Adjustments\nIn addition, FSC filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on May 5, 2017 for up to $100 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, or debt securities, to be issued from time to time for general corporate purposes which may include funding bank and non-bank subsidiaries, financing business expansion, or refinancing or extending the maturity of debt obligations and investments at the holding company level. The amount was available to be issued as of June 15, 2017, which was the date that the SEC issued a Notice of Effectiveness. As of December 31, 2018, we have not issued any securities under the shelf registration statement and, due to the pending merger, we do not anticipate issuing any securities under this registration statement.\nNet Income\nBank owned life insurance income increased by $2.5 million compared to prior year primarily due to a non recurring $2.6 million death benefit received from cash surrender value life insurance policies in 2018.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nSalaries and benefits expense increased by $10.2 million, or 9.8%, in 2018, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to the higher salaries and employee benefits associated with employee incentives due to performance and related to the balance sheet strategies implemented earlier in the year, and from a comparison perspective, no executive incentives were paid in 2017.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $446.2 million and $401.6 million, respectively. The $44.6 million increase in shareholders' equity over December 31, 2017 was attributable to net income earned of $43.8 million, and common\nORE, consisting of properties obtained through acquisition, foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans, is initially reported at fair value, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Management also considers other factors, including changed economic conditions since the last appraisal, changes in absorption rates, stale appraisals or imprecision and subjectivity of the appraisal process, length of time the property has been on the market and anticipated sales values, which have resulted in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in certain appraisals.\nA portion of our profitability, as with most financial institutions, is dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is affected by prevailing interest rates, nonperforming assets and competition among financial institutions for loans and deposits.\nNoninterest income for 2017 was $135.0 million compared to $141.3 million in 2016, a $6.4 million, or 4.5% decrease. This decrease was primarily a result of decreases in mortgage banking, indirect lending, and SBA lending activities as noted below.\nSince our inception in 1973, we have pursued managed profitable growth through providing quality financial services. Our overall focus is on building shareholder value. Our mission is to continue growth, improve earnings and increase shareholder value; to treat customers, employees, community and shareholders according to the \"Golden Rule\"; and to operate within a culture of strong internal controls.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n\nYear over year balance sheet changes and assumption updates have slightly increased net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The rate shock analysis at December 31, 2018 indicated that all of the scenarios would fall within policy parameters and approved tolerances for net interest income and EVE at risk. If large downward shocks were to occur from today's low rates, increased MSR modeled impairment may breach net income benchmarks.\nIncome tax expense was $1.5 million, or 9.8%, lower in 2018 than in 2017, as a result of the rate change following the enactment on December 22, 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent as of the beginning of the tax year 2018.\n\nLoans accruing delinquent 30-89 days increased by $2.7 million at December 31, 2018, to $24.7 million compared to $22.1 million at December 31, 2017, mainly due to increases in 30-89 days delinquencies in the mortgage loan and construction loan portfolios over the year. Of the $12.6 million in 30-89 day delinquencies in the mortgage loan portfolio, $9.2 million were only past due 30 days primarily due to timing of month end in December.\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans (including repurchased government guaranteed loans), loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, repossessions, and other real estate (\"ORE\"). Nonaccrual loans are loans on which the interest accruals have been discontinued when it appears that future collection of principal or interest according to the contractual terms may be doubtful. Troubled debt restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been modified, because of economic or legal\nInterest expense in 2017 increased by $2.3 million, or 11.2%, to $22.7 million, primarily as the result of a $107.0 million, or 3.7%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances and, to a lesser degree, a 5 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for 2017 was primarily due to the growth in interest bearing demand and money market deposits of $257.7 million as Fidelity had a successful advertising campaign in Florida during 2017 to attract new demand and money market deposits.\nOn March 17, 2005, we issued $10.0 million in floating rate capital securities of Fidelity Southern Statutory Trust II with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security. Interest adjusts quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.89%, with a rate of 4.68% and 3.49% at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The issuance has a final maturity of 30 years, but may be redeemed at any distribution payment date at the redemption price of 100%.\n\nCredit Quality\nResults of Operations - 2018 Compared to 2017\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REVIEW\n \u2022 Pricing deposits, including CD's, at rate levels that will sustain balances at levels that will enhance our asset liability management and net interest margin requirements; and \nVisa Class B Stock\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of loans held for investment at December 31, 2018 with maturity dates after one year and their general repricing characteristics:\nFHLB borrowing capacity is based on the lower of 25% of assets or pledged loans' lendable collateral value less outstanding advance balances. As of December 31, 2018, there was $590.7 million FHLB capacity with $125.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding, additionally, there was $92.0 million brokered CD's outstanding with remaining capacity of $493.6 million. We hold investments in FHLB stock for the purposes of maintaining credit lines with the FHLB.\nTime deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 were $176.7 million and $178.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe acquisition of AEB in March 2016 resulted in the recording of $5.2 million in goodwill. We review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\ninvestors to fund scheduled principal, interest, tax and insurance payments that mortgage loan borrowers have failed to make, to cover foreclosure costs and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced. These servicer advance obligations require capital and liquidity to fund these advances until we are contractually authorized to be reimbursed from the loan investors. While the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors, one of the primary goals of ALCO is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in both normal operating conditions and in periods of internal or industry stress.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding (i) the total dollar amount of interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rate; (iii) net interest income; (iv) net interest spread; and (v) net interest margin. The average balances are principally daily averages, and, for loans, include both performing and non-performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion on acquired loans and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments.\nThe following table summarizes the results of a 12-month forecasting period of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of 100 and 200 basis points in market interest rates as of December 31, 2018, and 2017:\nServicing rights are tested for impairment on at least a quarterly basis based on fair value. Management uses a model operated and maintained by an independent third party to assist in determining fair value which stratifies the servicing portfolio into homogeneous subsets with unique behavior characteristics. The model then converts those characteristics into income and expense streams, adjusts those streams for prepayments, present values the adjusted streams, and combines the present values into a total. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, prepayment speeds, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold servicing retained, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received. Management periodically obtains an independent review of the valuation assumptions to validate the fair value estimate and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in measuring fair value.\nFair Value\n (2) Collateralized with investment grade securities or with pledged real estate loans. \nAt the time of acquisition, foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the allowance for loan losses. After the transfer to ORE, the fair value, less estimated selling costs, becomes the new cost basis for the ORE. Subsequent declines in the fair value of ORE, below the new cost basis are recognized by a charge to income.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations. Such provisions are based on management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, including loan portfolio concentrations, current economic conditions, past loan loss experience, adequacy of underlying collateral, and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve consideration in estimating loan losses. Loans are charged off when, in the opinion of management, such loans are deemed to be uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance.\nWe have continued to focus on organic growth and building meaningful presence and relationships in Georgia and northern, eastern and central Florida. We believe our retail branch network positions us to generate new customers and business opportunities.\n\nStandby and import letters of credit are commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans or lines of credit to customers. We hold collateral supporting those commitments as deemed necessary.\nOn May 29, 2015, the Bank issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (the Notes\u201d). The Notes are due May 31, 2030 and bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.875% per year until May 31, 2025. From June 1, 2025 to the maturity date, the interest rate will be a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 363 basis points. The Bank incurred approximately $1.1 million of acquisition costs in connection with the debt issuance. The Notes were priced at 100% of their par value. We can call the Notes at their par value in whole or in part on June 1, 2025 or any interest payment date thereafter. The Notes contain certain restrictions on the merger or consolidation of the Company or the sale or transfer of its assets into another entity. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 regulatory capital for the Bank and the Company.\n(2) Excludes GNMA and SBA guaranteed loans and acquired loans. See non-GAAP reconciliation table for a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure.\nOn May 28, 2015, the U.S. Treasury sold its warrant in a private transaction with two unaffiliated third-party investors.\nAverage nonperforming assets were $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $62.0 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $5.1 million or 8.3%.\nMarket Risk\nand our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulator. We also maintain various wholesale sources of funding and expect our interest cost to vary based on the range of interest rates charged.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe provision for loan losses was $4.3 million in 2017 and $8.2 million in 2016. Net charge-offs were flat at $4.2 million in 2017 and in 2016. The decrease in the provision in 2017, compared to 2016 was primarily due to continued improvement in asset quality in 2017.\nRate shock analysis provides only a limited, point in time view of interest rate sensitivity. The actual impact of interest rate changes upon earnings and net present value may differ from that implied by any rate shock. In addition, net interest income and net present value under various future interest rate scenarios are affected by multiple other factors not embodied in a rate shock, including competition, changes in the shape of the Treasury yield curve, divergent movement among various interest rate indices, and the speed with which interest rates change.\nThe following table summarizes scheduled remaining maturities for time deposits in denominations of $100,000 and greater as of December 31, 2018:\nWe account for the discount on loans which do not have a discount materially attributable to credit or revolving type loans by accreting the discount on each individual loan over time using a level yield approach based on the contractual cash flows for term loans or on a straight-line basis for revolving loans. The methodology also considers the remaining fair value discounts recognized upon acquisition associated with purchased non-impaired loans in estimating a general allowance and also includes establishing an ALL for purchased credit-impaired loans that have deteriorated in credit quality since acquisition.\nThe categories of our noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:\nProfessional and other services also increased by $3.1 million, or 20.5%, primarily due to increased expenses paid to vendors for infrastructure improvement projects and costs associated with new and existing regulations. Fidelity remains committed to implementing changes to operations and technology that will enable the Bank to be more efficient and effective in its growth strategies.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, Fidelity's shareholders will have the right to receive 0.80 shares (the Exchange Ratio\u201d) of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Ameris Common Stock for each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Fidelity Common Stock that they hold, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares.\n\nRate/Volume Variance Analysis\nRevenue from ORE operations as well as gains or losses on sales is recorded as a component of noninterest income. Expenses from ORE operations are recorded as a component of noninterest expense.\nThe provision for income taxes expense for 2017 and 2016, was $15.3 million and $22.1 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 27.7% and 36.4%, respectively. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, Fidelity remeasured its net deferred tax liability position to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This revaluation resulted in a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $4.9 million in 2017.\nInterest Rate and Maturity Distribution of Borrowings\nThe following management discussion and analysis addresses important factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the periods indicated. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with this review.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nCredit quality risk in the loan portfolio provides our highest degree of risk. We manage and control risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to standards established by the Board of Directors and senior management, combined with a commitment to producing quality assets, monitoring loan performance, developing profitable relationships, and meeting the strategic loan quality and growth targets. Our credit policies establish underwriting standards, place limits on exposures, which include concentrations and commitments, and set other limits or standards as deemed necessary and prudent. Also included in the policy, primarily determined by the amount and type of loan, are various approval levels, ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized.\nAt December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses was $31.2 million, or 0.85% of loans, compared to $29.8 million, or 0.83% of loans, at December 31, 2017. The allowance (excluding acquired and indirect allowance) to adjusted loans (excluding acquired and indirect loans), a non-GAAP measure, was 1.12% at December 31, 2018 compared to 1.16% at December 31, 2017. Management uses this measure to provide better visibility into the allowance as part of its strategic initiative to de-emphasize indirect loans and grow loans in categories other than indirect, mainly commercial, construction and SBA. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding during each respective period were 0.11% in 2018, a slight decrease as compared to 0.12% for 2017.\nInvestment securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2018 increased by $131.5 million, or 109.5%, from December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in residential mortgage-backed securities investments of $135.2 million, partially offset by small decreases in other categories. Investment securities available for sale at December 31, 2017 decreased by $24.2 million, or 16.8%, over December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of securities being called during the year.\nIn December 2008, as part of the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, the U.S. Treasury purchased 48,200 shares of the Company's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Stock\u201d), and a warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $48.2 million in cash. On June 27, 2012, the Treasury sold all of its shares of the Company's Preferred Stock in a public offering as part of a modified Dutch auction process. The Company did not receive any proceeds from this auction.\nFor information relating to recent accounting standards and pronouncements, see Footnote 1 to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements entitled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nDuring 2016 and 2015, we received Warrant exercise notices for cash and cashless exercises, resulting in the issuance of 1,000,000 and 1,487,487 shares of common stock, respectively. In 2016, all exercises were cash exercises for aggregate proceeds of $2.7 million, resulting in the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of common stock. During 2016, 1,346,873 equivalent shares exercised were cashless, resulting in the issuance of 1,140,614 shares of common stock and cash exercise aggregated $931,354, resulting in the issuance of 346,873 shares of common stock.\nliabilities are amortized over the expected lives of the serviced loans utilizing the interest method. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received.\nIn particular, management uses tangible shareholders' equity, adjusted allowance for loan losses, adjusted nonperforming assets, adjusted nonperforming loans, adjusted total loans, and related ratios, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses (i) tangible shareholders' equity (which exclude goodwill and other intangibles from equity) and related ratios to evaluate the adequacy of shareholders' equity and to facilitate comparisons with peers; and (ii) adjusted allowance for loan losses (which includes adjustments related to acquired loans and indirect auto loans), adjusted non-performing assets and adjusted loans (which includes adjustments for repurchased government-guaranteed loans, SBA guaranteed loans and acquired loans) as supplemental information to evaluate both asset quality and asset quality trends, and to facilitate comparisons with peers. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP finance measures to their nearest GAAP measure appears in the following table:\nTotal loans, which include loans held for investment and loans held-for-sale, decreased by $13.9 million, or 0.4%, at December 31, 2018 over December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in indirect auto loans of $221.9 million, as Fidelity exited all markets except Florida and Georgia. This decrease was offset by growth in all other loan categories, particularly commercial and residential mortgage. The loan portfolio is the largest component of our earning assets. The volume of loans is a key driver of our net interest margin as loans typically product higher yields than investment securities and other earning assets. Our strategy is to grow loans in all categories by originating loans that we believe to be of high quality that comply with our conservative credit policies with terms that produce revenues that meet our financial objectives.\nValuation of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Purchase Accounting Adjustments\nA formal review of the allowance for loan losses is prepared quarterly to assess the probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. For purposes of management's review, the loan portfolio is separated by loan type. The level of allowance required for each loan type is determined based upon historical charge-off experience and current internal and external qualitative factors. Acquired purchased credit-impaired (\"PCI\") loans are evaluated for impairment each quarter and if a pool is impaired, an allowance for loan loss is recorded.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nIn addition to traditional measures, management provides information it considers useful to investors in understanding the Company's operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of its peers. Management also uses these measures internally to assess and better understand the Company's underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators used by the Company may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and performance indicators used by other financial institutions to assess their performance and trends.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $135.5 million in 2017 compared to $129.4 million in 2016, an increase of $6.1 million, or 4.7%. Average interest-earning assets in 2017 increased by $259.9 million to $4.2 billion, a 6.7% increase when compared to 2016. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $107.0 million to $3.0 billion, a 3.7% increase. The net interest margin decreased by 6 basis points to 3.26% in 2017 when compared to 2016. The primary components of our net interest income and margin are described below.\nThe Credit Review Department ( Credit Review\u201d) regularly reports to senior management and the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as well as trends in the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Credit Review monitors loan concentrations, production, loan growth, as well as loan quality, and independent from the lending departments, reviews risk ratings and tests credits approved for adherence to our lending standards. Finally, Credit Review also performs ongoing, independent reviews of the risk management process and adequacy of loan documentation. The results of its reviews are reported to the Loan and Discount Committee of the Board of Directors. The consumer collection function is centralized and automated to ensure timely collection of accounts and consistent management of risks associated with delinquent accounts.\nInterest expense in 2018 increased by $9.2 million, or 40.3%, to $31.9 million, primarily as the result of a $96.8 million, or 3.2%, increase in average interest-bearing liability balances and a 27 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of $109.7 million, offset by a slight decrease in average deposits of $13.0 million.\nExcluding the effects of the one-time tax benefit recorded to revalue the net deferred tax liability and the benefit of discrete items recorded for employee stock option exercises, the effective tax rate was 23.9% in 2018 compared to 38.2% in 2017.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of 2018 and 2017 was 0.85% and 0.83%, respectively. The slight increase is mainly due to increases in provision for loan losses from increased commercial loan balances.\nNoninterest expense increased by $9.9 million, or 4.9%, in 2017 to $210.9 million compared to 2016, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits and to increases in professional and other services.\nSubordinated Debt\nLoan servicing rights increased by $7.8 million, or 6.9%, to $120.4 million at December 31, 2018, compared to December 31, 2017. MSRs, the primary component of loan servicing rights, contributed the majority of the change, increasing by $10.7 million or 10.7%, to $111.4 million, offset primarily by decreasing indirect auto servicing rights of $2.7 million at December 31, 2018. The current estimated fair market value of MSRs was $116.8 million at December 31, 2018.\nOur liabilities also provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposits and certain interest-sensitive deposits, brokered deposits, available unsecured overnight federal funds lines from correspondent banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings such as a collateralized line of credit at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta ( FRB\u201d) Discount Window and a collateralized line of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB\u201d).\ngenerally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nForeclosed assets are adjusted to fair value less estimated selling costs upon transfer of the loans to ORE, which becomes the new carrying value of the ORE. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral, sales agreements, or management's estimation of the value of the collateral using market data including recent sales activity for similar assets in the property's market. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, we record the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 3. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the property. Management continues to evaluate the appropriateness of appraised values on at least an annual basis.\nTrust and wealth management fees increased by $1.0 million to $2.3 million in 2018 compared to $1.3 million in prior year. We have expanded our Wealth Management business and team since 2017 with the addition of client advisors, and assets under management have continued to grow in 2018.\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $23.4 million for 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in our interest income primarily occurred due to the net growth of $270.4 million, or 6.5%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio, as well as an increase in yield on loans of 21 basis points, primarily in the commercial, construction, and mortgage loan portfolios, including an increase of 3 basis points attributable to accretable yield.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nWe use our borrowing capability with the FHLB as our primary funding source for borrowings. We enter into FHLB advances with terms that are consistent with our interest rate risk position at the time we enter into each advance. Our FHLB advances mature in less than one year and are collateralized with qualifying residential mortgage, home equity and commercial real estate loans and, from time to time, agency notes or agency mortgage-backed securities.\nThe aggregate principal balance of subordinated debt was $121.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 and consisted of amounts outstanding pursuant to the issuance of subordinated notes and trust preferred securities. The unamortized balance of debt issuance costs is netted against the aggregate principal amount in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Therefore, the balance reported as subordinated debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $120.7 million and $120.6 million, respectively, after netting out unamortized acquisition costs of $686,000 and $806,000, respectively. Related interest expense is reported as Interest expense: Subordinated debt\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n (2) Average yields reflect the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments using a 25% tax rate for 2018 and 35% tax rate for 2017.  Deposits\nInterest rate risk, which encompasses price risk, is the exposure of our financial condition and earnings ability to withstand adverse movements in interest rates. Price and interest rate risks arise from the financial instruments and positions we hold including loans, mortgage servicing rights, investment securities, deposits, borrowings, and derivative financial instruments. Accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value; however, excessive levels of interest rate risk can pose a significant threat to assets, earnings, and capital. Accordingly, effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our success.\nNoninterest income from indirect lending activities decreased by $2.4 million, or 15.9%, as indirect loan production decreased by $208.4 million, or 15.1%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, and indirect sales decreased by $79.3 million, or 15.5% leading to decreased gains on loan sales in 2017 as compared to 2016. Indirect servicing income remained consistent with 2016 at $9.2 million. The decrease in gains occurred due to the industry-wide weakening of the indirect auto loan sales market.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest income from SBA lending activities decreased by $1.1 million or 19.8% in 2017, to $12.5 million, compared to 2016 due to lower sales of SBA loans in 2017, which resulted in lower gain on sales and lower capitalization of servicing rights. SBA servicing income remained consistent with 2016 at $2.5 million.\nThe Bank had $24.6 million in troubled debt restructured loans at December 31, 2018, of which $16.2 million were accruing loans and $8.4 million are on nonaccrual status and are included in nonperforming assets in the table above.\nImpaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired, at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs. A loan is considered impaired if it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due according to the terms of the loan agreement. Measuring the impairment of loans using the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, is not considered a fair value measurement. For collateral-dependent loans, fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans and is classified as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may include real estate or business assets, including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. The value of real estate collateral is determined based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers ordered by our internal appraisal department, which is independent of our lending function. If significant, the value of business equipment is based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers ordered by our internal appraisal department; otherwise, the equipment's net book value on the business's financial statements is the basis for the value of business equipment. Inventory and accounts receivable collateral are valued based on independent field examiner review or aging reports. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.\nThe significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our IRLCs is the pull-through ratio, which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. Generally, the fair value of an IRLC is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the IRLC rate. Therefore, an increase in the pull-through ratio (i.e., higher percentage of loans are estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the IRLC increasing if in a gain position, or decreasing if in a loss position. The pull-through ratio is largely dependent on the processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. The pull-through ratio is computed by the secondary marketing department using historical data and the ratio is reviewed by the Secondary Marketing Department of the Mortgage Banking Division for reasonableness.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nOur loans held for sale are considered highly liquid. The majority of these loans are conforming residential mortgage loans sold to GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. Other categories of loans held for sale include the government-guaranteed portion of SBA loans and the balance of indirect automobile loans purchased from motor vehicle dealers. The portfolio of indirect auto loans held for sale fluctuates based on the demand for loan sales from investors, mainly other financial institutions which has declined in recent years.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur investment securities consisted primarily of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government-sponsored entities (\"GSE's\") which expose us to a low level of credit and liquidity risk. The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at the time periods indicated:\nTotal average deposits for 2018 increased by $129.1 million, or 3.4%, over 2017. Average core deposits for 2018 increased by $235.8 million, or 8.4%, over 2017, primarily due to the above mentioned transaction account acquisition initiative. Average time deposits for 2018 decreased by $106.8 million, or 10.5%, from 2017, as the enhanced core deposit base allowed the Bank to be more relationship-oriented in its approach to time deposits and non-core brokered CD's. Total average deposits for 2017 increased by $364.2 million, or 10.5%, over 2016, with $386.8 million of the increase coming from core deposits. The increase in core deposits was primarily due to organic growth from our transaction account initiatives, including money market promotions that ran primarily in our Florida markets.\nThe following table outlines the changes in our allowance for losses during the five-year period ended December 31, 2018:\nNo less frequently than quarterly, management reviews the status of mortgage loans held-for-sale for which fair value has been elected and pools of servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets results in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nWe file a consolidated federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in several states. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The net deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting period to assess the probability of realization of benefits in future periods and whether valuation allowances are appropriate. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. As the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, we remeasured our net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent from the beginning of the tax year 2018. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is more likely than not\u201d that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. Management has reviewed all evidence, both positive and negative, and concluded that a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset is not needed at December 31, 2018. The calculation of the income tax provision is complex and requires the use of judgments and estimates in its determination.\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements consist of balances in the transaction accounts of our commercial customers swept nightly to an overnight investment account. Securities sold under repurchase agreements are not subject to offset.\nIndirect automobile loans decreased by $146.9 million, or 8.6%, over December 31, 2017 as lower sales volume was noted in 2018 as compared to 2017 as the bank completed its strategy to exit all markets except for Georgia and Florida. Residential mortgage loans increased by $104.4 million, or 21.3%, over December 31, 2017 as solid production in the residential mortgage portfolio continued. Commercial loans increased by $93.0 million, or 11.5%, over December 31, 2017 and construction loans increased by $31.1 million, or 12.5%, compared to December 31, 2017, as we have added new lenders in our strategy to re-balance the portfolio with higher-yielding commercial credits and de-emphasizing indirect auto lending.\nThe following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on management's estimates, assumptions, and judgments.\n\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $43.8 million and we reported $1.61 for the basic and fully diluted earnings per share. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $39.8 million and we reported basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.50 and $1.49, respectively. The $4.0 million increase in net income in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of $14.3 million, and increase in noninterest income of $3.9 million; offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $14.4 million. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below.\n (1) Financial commitments include both secured and unsecured obligations to fund. Certain residential construction and acquisition and development commitments relate to revolving\u201d commitments whereby payments are received as individual homes or parcels are sold; therefore, the outstanding balances at any one-time will be less than the total commitment. Construction loan commitments in excess of one year have provisions to convert to term loans at the end of the construction period. \nDeposits are a primary source of funding for us and provide us with the ability to successfully meet both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We provide a full range of deposit accounts and services to both individuals and businesses for which we charge reasonable service fees such as monthly account maintenance fees, overdraft fees, etc. While retail deposits are a primary source of funding and provide a customer base for cross-selling additional products and services, we also emphasize commercial accounts as an opportunity for growth and to meet our business customers' needs. We also utilize brokered time deposits as a funding source, although to a lesser degree.\nThe provision for loan losses was $5.5 million in 2018 and $4.3 million in 2017, an increase of $1.2 million or 29.1%, mainly due to increases in commercial loan balances. Net charge-offs were relatively flat at $4.1 million in 2018 and $4.2 million in 2017. Credit quality trend performance remains consistent and strong as net charge-offs were 0.11% of average loans for the year.\n\nManagement reviews the value of ORE on at least a quarterly basis and adjusts the values as appropriate. Generally, a new appraisal is received annually on each ORE property. Any subsequent adjustments to reflect changes in fair value and selling costs are recorded as a component of other noninterest expense or a reduction of any existing valuation allowance on a property by property basis, but not below zero. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy.\nWe sell indirect automobile loan pools, residential mortgages and SBA loans with servicing retained. When the contractual servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. When the expected costs to a servicer for performing loan servicing are not expected to adequately compensate a servicer, a capitalized servicing liability is recognized. Servicing assets and servicing\nThe fair value of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include market trade pricing from brokers and investors and the mortgage-backed security markets. As such, we classify these loans as Level 2.\nThe increase in revenue from other fees and charges of $1.1 million, or 13.3%, stems from an increase in customer accounts, particularly due to the successful marketing campaign in Florida and increasing revenue from debit card and ATM fees in 2018, as compared to 2017.\nWe classify IRLCs on residential mortgage loans held for sale on a gross basis within other liabilities or other assets. The fair value of these commitments, while based on interest rates observable in the market, is highly dependent on the ultimate closing of the loans. These pull-through\u201d rates are based on both our historical data and the current interest rate environment and reflect our best estimate of the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan. The loan servicing value is also included in the fair value of the IRLCs. Because these inputs are not transparent in market trades, we consider IRLCs to be Level 3 assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis. Sources of the Bank's liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities; investment securities eligible for sale or pledging to secure borrowings from customers pursuant to securities sold under agreements to repurchase; loan repayments; loan sales; etc.\nForward commitments are instruments that are used to hedge the value of the IRLC's and mortgage loans held-for-sale. We take investor commitments to sell a loan or pool of newly originated loans to an investor for an agreed upon price for delivery in the future. This type of forward commitment is also known as a mandatory commitment. Generally, the fair value of a forward is negative (positive) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the current commitment interest rate. The value of these commitments is ultimately determined by the investor that sold the commitment and represents a significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our forward commitments.\nIncome Taxes\nNonperforming Assets\nThe categories of noninterest income, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:\nNoninterest Income\nNet Income\nTrust and wealth management income increased $660,000, or 105.1%, to $1.3 million in 2017 compared to $628,000 in 2016 as Fidelity expanded its Wealth management services with the addition of client advisors in 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nWe mitigate liquidity risk by funding our asset growth with low-cost core deposits. In addition to monitoring our interest rate sensitivity, ALCO also manages our liquidity risk. ALCO meets regularly to review the current and projected net liquidity positions and to review actions taken by management to achieve this liquidity objective. The Board of Directors also reviews performance against internal liquidity benchmarks on at least a quarterly basis.\nManagement's primary objective in managing the investment securities portfolio includes maintaining a portfolio of high quality investments with competitive returns through the employment of excess funds not needed for loan demand or to offset fluctuations in deposits, while providing for pledging and liquidity needs within overall asset and liability management parameters. Our investment activities are governed internally by our Board-approved investment policy and carried out by our Treasury department. Investment strategies are reviewed by the ALCO based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan production and sales, projected funding needs and overall sensitivity to interest rate risk.\nDerivative instruments are primarily transacted in the secondary mortgage and institutional dealer markets and priced with observable market assumptions at a mid-market valuation point, with appropriate valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risk. For purposes of valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, we evaluate liquidity premiums that may be demanded by market participants, as well as the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit if applicable. To date, no material losses due to a counterparty's inability to pay any net uncollateralized position have occurred. Derivative instruments are considered to be Level 3.\n (4) Leases and other rental agreements typically have renewal options either at predetermined rates or market rates on renewal. \nThe increase in revenue from other fees and charges of $738,000, or 9.6%, stems from an increase in customer accounts, particularly due to the successful marketing campaign in Florida and increasing revenue from debit card and ATM fees in 2017, as compared to 2016.\nDetermining the fair value of assets and liabilities, particularly illiquid assets and liabilities, is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair value. Information regarding our loan discount and core deposit intangible asset may be adjusted as we refine our estimates. Purchase price allocations on completed acquisitions may be modified through the measurement date which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date. If we recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period, the amounts will be reported in the period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Fair value adjustments based on updated estimates could materially affect the goodwill, if any, recorded on the acquisition.\nreasons related to the debtors' financial difficulties and provide a concession to the borrower such as, a reduction in principal, change in terms, or modification of interest rates to below market levels. Repossessions include vehicles and other personal property that have been repossessed as a result of payment defaults. ORE is recorded at the lower of cost or market less the estimated cost to sell which is subject to future declines in real estate values. Purchased credit impaired loans are considered to be performing due to the application of the accretion method and are excluded from the table.\nThe increase in nonperforming assets of $8.1 million from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018, primarily resulted from an increase in nonaccrual loans, which increased by $7.7 million from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual residential mortgage loans of $10.3 million. This increase was primarily due to repurchases of government guaranteed loans discussed below.\nMarket risk is defined as the sensitivity of income, fair value measurements and capital to changes in market rates or prices. Our primary market risk exposure is credit risk and, to a lesser extent, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. We have little or no risk related to trading accounts, commodities, or foreign exchange. Our real estate loan portfolio is subject to risks associated with the local economies of our various markets and, in particular, the regional economy of the South.\nTaxable-equivalent interest income had an increase of $8.4 million for 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in our interest income primarily occurred due to the net growth of $259.9 million, or 6.7%, in average interest-earning assets, primarily in our loan portfolio, as well as an increase in yield on loans of 5 basis points, primarily in the commercial, construction, and mortgage loan portfolios, including an increase of 3 basis points attributable to accretable yield.\n\nServicing rights are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Servicing fee income, net of amortization of servicing rights, is reported as part of noninterest income from mortgage banking activities, indirect lending activities, and SBA lending activities, as applicable, in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nSchedule of Short-term Borrowings\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe one-time tax benefit recorded during the year to remeasure the net deferred tax liability represents a reasonable estimate determined by management. Any adjustments to provisional amounts determined during the measurement period will be reported as an adjustment to income tax expense or benefit in future periods. In addition, the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability as a result of the rate change does not have any cash flow effect and the change in the tax rate does not impact the time frame when the net deferred tax liability is expected to be settled.\nThe increase in interest expense in 2017 was primarily attributable to average interest-bearing deposits, which increased by $235.2 million, or 9.3%, to $2.8 billion during 2017 compared to 2016, while average borrowings decreased by $128.1 million, or 33.4%, to $254.9 million. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an increase of $257.7 million in interest-bearing money market and demand deposits as mentioned above.\n\nOur accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions, and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies, or conditions significantly different from certain assumptions, could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d Significant accounting policies have been periodically discussed and reviewed with and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors.\nLoans held for investment at December 31, 2018 grew to $3.7 billion, an increase of $104.5 million, or 2.9%, over December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased loan production, particularly in residential mortgage, commercial, and construction loans. In addition, we have exercised our buy-back option on delinquent mortgage loans serviced for GNMA since 2014, adding $24.6 million and $7.5 million in unpaid principal balances in residential mortgage loans held for investment to the portfolio during 2018 and 2017, respectively. We chose to exercise our buy-back option to avoid continuing to advance principal and interest on delinquent mortgage loans previously sold to the investor pool which allows us to work the loans through to resolution using our internal resources.\n\nManagement believes it has been proactive in charging down and charging off nonperforming assets as appropriate. Management's assessment of the overall loan portfolio is that loan quality and performance have improved in recent years, as indicated by the steady decrease in our nonperforming asset ratios. Management is being aggressive in evaluating credit relationships and proactive in addressing problems.\nWe continue to attract new customer relationships, and talented and experienced bankers to support our growth. We are also continuing to focus on asset quality, revenue growth, deposit growth and quality loan growth at a well-maintained capital level.\nThe following schedule provides a summary of our financial commitments to make future payments, primarily to fund loan and other credit obligations, long-term debt, and rental commitments under operating leases of various facilities housing our business development, executive administration and operational support functions as of December 31, 2018. Loan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these commitments are revolving\u201d commitments as discussed below and many are expected to expire unused or partially used, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Payments for borrowings do not include interest. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts.\nAverage Balances, Interest and Yields\nCapitalized Servicing Assets and Liabilities\nTotal deposits of $4.0 billion at December 31, 2018 increased by $114.4 million, or 3.0%, compared to December 31, 2017. Core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing demand accounts and interest-bearing demand accounts, including money market accounts and savings deposits accounted for $111.2 million of the increase, as the result of our continuing transaction account acquisition initiative, in both commercial and consumer accounts. Time deposits at December 31, 2018 increased by $3.2 million, or 0.3%.\nWealth Management began operations in July 2014 when we began offering trust services. We expanded our services and team in 2017 with the addition of client advisors. The Wealth Management division provides trust administration, investment management, financial and estate planning, specialized lending and banking for affluent and high net worth individuals.\nLoans\nNo less frequently than quarterly, management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nNoninterest income for 2018 was $138.9 million compared to $135.0 million in 2017, a $3.9 million, or 2.9% increase. This increase was primarily a result of increases in mortgage banking, SBA lending activities, and bank-owned life insurance income, offset by a decrease in indirect lending, as noted below.\ndiscount. We estimate expected cash flows at each future reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows generally result in a provision for loan losses, net of any amounts due from the FDIC under the applicable loss share agreement. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable discount, which has a positive effect on interest income. We have recorded acquired loans at fair value, exclusive of any amounts due from the FDIC under applicable loss share agreements.\nThe $45.0 million of trust preferred securities issued by our trusts, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Thus, the equity investments in the subsidiaries we created to issue the obligations, the obligations themselves, and related dividend income and interest expense are reported on an unconsolidated basis, with the investments in the amount of $1.4 million at December 31, 2018, and 2017, reported as other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and dividends included as other noninterest income in our Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNoninterest income from indirect lending activities decreased by $7.3 million, or 58.3%, as indirect loan production decreased by $543.9 million, or 46.6%, in 2018 as compared to 2017, and indirect sales decreased by $297.3 million, or 69.0% leading to decreased gains on loan sales in 2018 as compared to 2017. Indirect servicing income decreased by $1.8 million to $7.4 million compared to prior year. The decrease in gains occurred due to the industry-wide weakening of the indirect auto loan sales market, as well as the Company exiting all markets except Georgia and Florida.\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). A financial instrument's level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe average balance of loans outstanding in 2018 increased by $324.7 million, or 8.7%, to $4.1 billion when compared to 2017 as the number of loan originations increased, particularly commercial, construction and mortgage loans. The average balance of investments also increased by $41.9 million as the Bank continues to increase its investments available-for-sale portfolio as part of its strategy to reposition the balance sheet to higher yielding assets, and reduce its reliance on \"gain on sale\" income. The yield on interest-earning assets in 2018 reflected a 30 basis point increase as compared to 2017, as interest rates rose over the year.\nSBA and indirect loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is based on recent trades for similar loan pools as well as offering prices for similar assets provided by buyers in the secondary market. If the cost of a loan is determined to be less than the fair value of similar loans, the impairment is recorded by the establishment of a reserve to reduce the value of the loan.\nThe primary financial instruments we carry at fair value are investment securities, interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans ( IRLCs\u201d), derivative instruments, and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. We also carry certain impaired loans, foreclosed assets and capitalized servicing rights on residential mortgage and SBA loans at fair value.\n(1) The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to the components in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amounts of the change. Average loan volumes include nonperforming loans which result in the impact in the associated lost interest on nonaccrual loans being reflected in the average rate.\nThe categories of noninterest expense, and the dollar and percentage change between the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:\nIn addition, due to FSC being a separate entity and apart from the Bank, it must provide for its own liquidity. FSC is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its common and preferred shareholders, and interest and principal on any outstanding debt or trust preferred securities. Substantially all of FSC's cashflow obtained from capital raises and dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiaries, LionMark Insurance Company and the Bank, which are limited by applicable law. In addition, the Bank pays interest to FSC on the Bank's subordinated debt. Under the regulations of the GDBF, bank dividends may not exceed 50% of the prior year's net earnings without approval from the GDBF. If dividends received from the Bank were reduced or eliminated, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\n2018. We do not intend to have indirect auto loan sales in 2019. In addition, a decrease in residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $43.8 million, or 16.3% is the result of slower sales in 2018 compared to 2017.\n\nThe Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d), which is comprised of various senior executives, meets regularly to review our interest rate sensitivity positions and balance sheet mix; monitor our capital position and ratios; review our product offerings and pricing, including rates, fees and charges; monitor our funding needs and sources; and review cash flows to assess our current and projected liquidity. Throughout 2018, we have focused on executing our business strategy to re-balance our loan portfolio with higher-yielding commercial credits and de-emphasize indirect auto lending which is dependent on our growth.\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain consolidated quarterly financial information. This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods. The results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. This information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOn December 17, 2018, Fidelity entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Ameris Bancorp (\"Ameris\"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth, FSC will merge with and into Ameris (the Merger\u201d), in an all-stock transaction, with Ameris surviving the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the Bank will merge (the Bank Merger\u201d) with and into Ameris's wholly owned bank subsidiary, Ameris Bank. Ameris Bank will be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger. The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the board of directors of each of Fidelity and Ameris. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter 2019. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to the approval of FSC's shareholders, regulators, and certain other customary closing conditions.\nOur lending activities are significantly influenced by the local economic environments in the markets we serve. We have grown our consumer installment, mortgage, construction and commercial loan portfolios organically and through acquisitions as the economy continues to improve. Our loan portfolio is well diversified among consumer, business, and real estate lending. The credit quality of the loans we have originated continues to be strong.\nWe manage our assets and liabilities to maximize long-term earnings opportunities while maintaining the integrity of our financial position and the quality of earnings. To accomplish this objective, management strives for efficient management of interest rate risk and liquidity needs. The primary objectives of interest-sensitivity management are to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on the net interest margin and to manage the exposure to risk while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels. Liquidity is provided by our attempt to carefully structure our balance sheet as well as through both unsecured and secured lines of credit with other financial institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the FHLB\u201d), and the FRB.\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and that of financial institutions in general largely determines the access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound credit quality and appropriate levels of capital resources.\nThe following table summarizes average balances and interest

of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Net income was $43.8 million in 2018, up from $39.8 million in 2017, primarily due to higher net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. \n- Total assets grew to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018, up 3.4% from 2017, mainly due to increases in cash and investment securities.\n- Loans held for investment grew 2.9% over 2017 to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2018, with growth across most loan categories except indirect auto which declined as part of a strategic initiative.\n\nNet Interest Income \n- Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 10.5% to $149.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by 6.5% growth in average earning assets and a 12 basis point expansion in net interest margin to 3.38%.\n\nAsset Quality\n- Nonperforming assets were $71.5 million or 1.93% of loans, repossessions and ORE at December 31, 2018 compared to $63.3 million or 1.76% at December 31, 2017. \n- Net charge-offs remained low at 0.11% of average loans in 2018 compared to 0.12% in 2017.\n\nNoninterest Income\n- Noninterest income increased 2.9% to $138.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017, mainly due to higher income from mortgage banking, SBA lending and bank owned life insurance.\n\nNoninterest Expense \n- Noninterest expense rose 6.8% to $225.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by increases in salaries, commissions, and other expenses.\n\nIncome Taxes\n- Income tax expense decreased by 9.8% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the lower federal corporate tax rate that took effect in 2018."}
