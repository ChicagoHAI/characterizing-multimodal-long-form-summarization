Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section entitled Selected Financial Data\u201d and our financial statements and related notes appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops novel vaccines and immunotherapies to address diseases with significant unmet needs. We use our proprietary discovery platform, ATLASTM, to rapidly design vaccines and immunotherapies that act, in part, through T cell (or cellular) immune responses, in contrast to approved vaccines and immunotherapies, which are designed to act primarily through B cell (or antibody) immune responses. We believe that by harnessing T cells we can develop first-in-class vaccines and immunotherapies to address diseases where T cells are central to the control of the disease.\nWe have one product candidate in active Phase 2 clinical development, GEN-003, an immunotherapy for the treatment of genital herpes. We have another product candidate, GEN-004, a universal vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal infections, for which we have suspended development pending further data analysis and consultation with our advisers after we did not achieve statistically significant results in our Phase 2a human challenge study. We also have active research and pre-clinical development programs for diseases including genital herpes, chlamydia and malaria. We are also investigating the application of ATLAS to immuno-oncology target discovery.\nGEN-003 - Phase 2 immunotherapy for genital herpes\nOur lead program is GEN-003, a Phase 2 candidate therapeutic vaccine, or immunotherapy, that we are developing to treat genital herpes infections. Data from our double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating Phase 1/2a trial for GEN-003 represented the first reported instance of a therapeutic vaccine working against an infectious disease, and we have identified a dose in our Phase 2 trial which has showed an even greater reduction in viral shedding than the best dose in the Phase 1/2a trial.\nFinal analysis of the data from the Phase 1/2a trial showed that, for the best performing 30\u00b5g dose group, there was a sustained reduction in the viral shedding rate. After completion of dosing for this group, the viral shedding rate fell by 52% versus baseline and, at six months after the final dose, the shedding rate remained at 40% below baseline. The reduction in the genital lesion rate after completion of the third dose was greatest for the 30\u00b5g dose group at 48%. After six months, the reduction from baseline in genital lesion rate for this dose group was 65% and, after 12 months, the genital lesion rate was 42% lower than baseline. GEN-003 was safe and well tolerated over the 12 months of this trial.\nHaving identified a dose that, according to company-sponsored market research, delivers clinically meaningful efficacy in magnitude and durability, we are now conducting a 310-subject Phase 2 dose optimization trial. The objective of this trial is to confirm the results of the best performing dose in the Phase 1/2a trial and to test six other combinations of proteins and adjuvant to determine the optimal dose for future trials and potentially improve on the current profile of GEN-003.\nIn May 2015, we announced positive top-line data from the Phase 2 trial. Subjects were randomized to one of six dosing groups of either 30\u03bcg or 60\u03bcg per protein paired with one of three Matrix-M2TM adjuvant doses (25\u03bcg, 50\u03bcg, or 75\u03bcg). A seventh group received placebo. Subjects received three doses of GEN-003 or placebo at 21-day intervals. Baseline viral shedding and genital lesion rates were established for each subject in a 28-day observation period prior to the commencement of dosing by collecting 56 genital swab samples (two per day), which were analyzed for the presence of HSV-2 DNA, and by recording the days on which genital lesions were present. During the 28-day observation period immediately after completion of dosing, the best dose of 60\u03bcg per protein/75\u03bcg of adjuvant demonstrated a highly statistically significant (p<0.0001) 55% reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rate, the primary endpoint of the trial and a measure of anti-viral activity. All dose combinations tested, including the successful 30\u03bcg per protein/50\u03bcg of adjuvant dose from the prior Phase 1/2a trial, demonstrated a statistically significant viral shedding rate reduction versus baseline and only the lowest dose combination did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction versus placebo. In a planned secondary analysis to assess impact on patient reported genital lesion rates, all dose groups, including the placebo group, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline. Furthermore, there was no difference in discontinuations in patient dosing due to AEs across the different treatment arms.\nIn October 2015, we announced positive results from a planned interim analysis of data collected six months after dosing. At its best performing dose of 60\u00b5g per protein / 75\u00b5g of adjuvant, GEN-003 demonstrated a statistically significant 58% reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rate (p < 0.0001). In a planned secondary analysis, the proportion of patients receiving GEN-003 who were lesion-free at six months after dosing ranged from approximately 30% to 50%, similar to results reported in clinical trials with oral antiviral therapies. In addition, the time to first recurrence after completion of dosing showed a range of 152 days to greater than 180 days among dose groups. In a further secondary analysis measuring the impact on genital lesion rates, GEN-003 demonstrated sustained and statistically significant reductions from baseline in five of six dose groups ranging from 43% to 69%. The Phase 2 trial continues to show that GEN-003 is safe and well tolerated by patients, with no serious adverse events related to the vaccine. Data from the 12-month observation period in this trial is expected later in the first quarter of 2016.\nFollowing improvements that we have made to the manufacturing process for GEN-003 to enable production at commercial scale, we initiated patient screening in the fourth quarter of 2015 and commenced the dosing phase in January 2016 for a 135-subject Phase 2b study to confirm the efficacy of this new material. Subjects will be randomized to one of two dose levels of GEN-003 or a placebo. We expect to announce top-line viral shedding rate data from the 28-day observation period immediately after dosing from this study in the middle of 2016. The study will also compare GEN-003 efficacy to placebo for the clinical endpoints of: the proportion of patients who are lesion free at six and 12 months after dosing; the time to first lesion recurrence after dosing; and, the impact on percentage of days with genital herpes lesions at six and 12 months after dosing. Data from these six and 12 month clinical endpoints is expected in the second half of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. All subjects will be followed for 12 months after the last dose.\nIn the second half of 2016, we intend to commence a Phase 2b study to investigate the potential benefits of using GEN-003 in combination with oral antiviral medicines. We also intend to conduct an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in late 2016. We retain all rights to GEN-003 and plan to advance this program through regulatory approval and, if approved, commercialize this vaccine through a focused commercial effort in the United States. Outside the United States, we intend to evaluate partnerships for GEN-003 opportunistically.\nIf GEN-003 successfully completes clinical development and is approved, we believe it would represent an important new treatment option for patients with genital herpes.\nGEN-004 - Universal vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal infections\nWe also have a second T cell-stimulating vaccine candidate, GEN-004, a potential universal Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, vaccine to protect against the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. GEN-004 is designed to stimulate T helper 17 (\"Th17\") cells, a rare cell type that provides immunity at epithelial and mucosal surfaces, in the nasopharynx to prevent colonization by pneumococcus.\nIn June 2014, we announced top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial for GEN-004. This trial met its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity goals including measurable increases in the blood of Th17 cells. We initiated a 98-subject\nPhase 2a trial in September 2014 to demonstrate that GEN-004 can reduce the frequency, magnitude and duration of colonization of pneumococcus in the nasopharynx in healthy adults.\nIn October 2015, we announced that top-line results from the Phase 2a clinical trial for GEN-004 showed consistent reductions versus placebo in the pre-specified endpoints of the rate and density of colonization, but that neither of the endpoints achieved statistical significance. GEN-004 was safe and well tolerated by subjects. GEN-004 reduced the colonization rate, measured by microbiological culture, by between 22% and 25% versus placebo across those measurement time points. When measured by the presence of pneumococcal DNA, the reductions ranged between 18% and 36%. Additionally the median density of colonization measured by microbiological culture for GEN-004 treated subjects ranged from zero to two colony forming units (\"CFUs\") per mL of nasal wash compared to one to 11 CFUs per mL for the placebo group. When measured by the presence of pneumococcal DNA, the median densities ranged from zero to 10 copies per mL in treated subjects and 19 to 52 copies per mL in placebo subjects. None of the differences were statistically significant. There was no difference in the duration of colonization between GEN-004 and placebo.\nAlthough we did not achieve statistical significance in this study, the consistent apparent effect supports the vaccine concept and in the potential for GEN-004. We believe it is possible that future trials would require a change in some combination of dose, adjuvant or trial population to confirm any effect. Pending ongoing data analysis and consultation with our advisors to determine next steps for this program, we have suspended the development of GEN-004 from our near-term plans and will focus our resources on the ongoing GEN-003 program, and on maximizing the potential of our preclinical pipeline and our ATLAS technology for T cell target discovery.\nResearch and non-clinical development in oncology\nWe initiated a research collaboration with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (\"DFCI\") in 2014 to apply the ATLAS platform in immuno-oncology. This collaboration centered on ATLAS's potential to identify patterns of T cell response in cancer patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor (\"CPI\") therapy. By analyzing the immune responses of both responders and non-responders to CPI therapy, ATLAS successfully identified the cancer antigens to which either (or both) CD4+ or CD8+ T cells became activated. While this research was not powered to draw firm conclusions, the analysis of T cell responses in patients receiving CPI therapy revealed a pattern indicating a greater breadth of T cell activation for responders than non-responders. The study also revealed preliminary evidence that different characteristics of T cell responses emerge when comparing patients who respond and those who do not. Some T cell responses did not correspond with improved patient outcomes, and may be classified as decoys,\u201d further validating the ability of ATLAS to distinguish clinically relevant targets of T cell response. The collaboration with DFCI is ongoing as we continue to analyze more tumor samples to characterize T cell response profiles that may be prognostic of CPI efficacy, and to identify T cell antigens that may be included in novel immunotherapies.\nIn November 2015, we also announced a collaboration with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to screen the T cell responses of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with CPIs against the complete repertoire of patient-specific putative cancer neoantigens. The goals of the collaboration are to identify signatures of T cell response in cancer patients associated with response or non-response to CPI therapy and to discover new T cell cancer vaccine antigens. ATLAS will be used in conjunction with Memorial Sloan Kettering's patient-specific cancer neoantigen sequences and blood samples from the same cancer patients.\nIn November 2015, we commenced a new program focused on Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV\u201d). EBV infection has been linked to cancers with high unmet needs such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. We believe the ATLAS platform is highly suited to the creation of a new immunotherapy for EBV given that T cell responses are understood to be crucial for protection against EBV. Furthermore, EBV is part of the herpesvirus family, in which we have years of experience through our development of GEN-003.\nResearch and non-clinical development in infectious disease\nWe have ongoing non-clinical development programs in chlamydia and genital herpes prophylaxis and a research program funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (\"Gates Foundation\") in malaria.\nFinancing and business operations\nWe commenced business operations in August 2006. To date, our operations have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring and developing our proprietary ATLAS technology, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates. All of our revenue to date has been grant revenue. We have not generated any product revenue and do not expect to do so for the foreseeable future. We have primarily\nfinanced our operations through the issuance of our equity securities, debt financings and amounts received through grants. As of December 31, 2015, we had received an aggregate of $278.8 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and gross proceeds from debt facilities and an aggregate of $7.9 million from grants. At December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investments were $106.4 million.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $42.5 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our accumulated deficit was $157.9 million as of December 31, 2015. We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nIn March 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6.3 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.25 per share for an aggregate offering price of $51.7 million. In August 2015, we completed another underwritten public offering of 3.9 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $50.1 million. We received net proceeds from these offerings of approximately $95.7 million, after deducting approximately $6.1 million in underwriting discounts and commissions, excluding offering costs payable by us.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2015 are sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2017. Through this timeframe, we expect to have results from multiple Phase 2 GEN-003 studies including the twelve-month data from our ongoing dose optimization clinical trial, a Phase 2b study to test the efficacy of GEN-003 following changes in the manufacturing process to allow for production at commercial scale and a study to investigate the potential benefits of using GEN-003 in combination with oral antiviral medicines. In late 2016, we also expect to have conducted our FDA end of Phase 2 meeting for GEN-003 and we expect to commence Phase 3 studies in the second half of 2017. However, costs related to clinical trials can be unpredictable and therefore there can be no guarantee that our current balances of cash, cash equivalents and investments, and any proceeds received from other sources, will be sufficient to fund our studies or operations through this period. These funds will not be sufficient to enable us to conduct pivotal clinical trials for, seek marketing approval for or commercially launch GEN-003 or any other product candidate. Accordingly, to obtain marketing approval for and to commercialize these or any other product candidates, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital when needed would have a negative effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nFinancial Overview\nGrant revenue\nGrant revenue consists of revenue earned to conduct vaccine development research. We have received grants from private not-for-profit organizations and federal agencies. These grants have related to the discovery and development of several of our product candidates, including product candidates for the prevention of pneumococcus, chlamydia, and malaria. Revenue under these grants is recognized as research services are performed. Funds received in advance of research services being performed are recorded as deferred revenue. We plan to continue to pursue grant funding, but there can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining such grants in the future.\nWe have no products approved for sale. We will not receive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products or until we potentially enter into agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of product candidates. If our development efforts for any of our product candidates result in regulatory approval or we enter into collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue from product sales or from such third parties.\nWe expect that our revenue will be less than our expenses for the foreseeable future and that we will experience increasing losses as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. Our ability to generate revenue for each product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval will depend on numerous factors, including competition, commercial manufacturing capability and market acceptance of our products.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to advance our preclinical and clinical candidates, which include:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and travel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (\"CROs\"), contract manufacturing organizations (\"CMOs\"), consultants and other vendors that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials and lab supplies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>facility costs, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense internal research and development costs to operations as incurred. We expense third party costs for research and development activities, such as conducting clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific performance or tasks such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information, which is provided to us by our vendors.\nThe following table identifies research and development expenses on a program-specific basis for our product candidates (in thousands):\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Genital herpes (GEN-003)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pneumococcus (GEN-004)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other research and development (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\n(1)Includes direct and indirect internal costs and external costs such as CMO and CRO costs.\n(2)Includes costs related to other product candidates and certain technology platform development costs related to ATLAS.\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase as we continue the manufacture of pre-clinical and clinical materials and manage the clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, GEN-003.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses, in executive and other administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees associated with corporate and intellectual property legal expenses, consulting and accounting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support the continued research and development of our product candidates and to operate as a public company. These increases will likely include higher costs for insurance, hiring activities, and professional services, such as outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of our first product candidate appears likely, we anticipate that we will increase our salary and personnel costs and other expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on our long-term debt facilities and non-cash interest related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by interest earned on our cash, cash equivalent and investment portfolio.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense consists of fair value adjustments on warrants to purchase preferred stock. Upon completion of our IPO on February 10, 2014, warrants to purchase preferred stock were converted to warrants to purchase common stock and as a\nresult, the Company no longer recorded fair value adjustments for its warrants. Other expense also consists of loss on debt extinguishment.\nAccretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock\nCertain classes of our preferred stock were redeemable beginning in 2017 at the original issuance price plus any declared or accrued but unpaid dividends upon written election of the preferred stockholders in accordance with the terms of our articles of incorporation. Accretion of preferred stock reflects the accretion of issuance costs and, for Series B preferred stock, cumulative dividends based on their respective redemption values. On February 10, 2014, we completed our IPO and all shares of preferred stock were converted into 11,466,479 shares of our Common Stock. No accretion of preferred stock is recorded after this date as no shares of preferred stock are outstanding.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which include, but are not limited to, estimates related to clinical trial accruals, prepaid and accrued research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, common stock warrants, warrants to purchase redeemable securities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates or assumptions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nPrepaid and Accrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our prepaid and accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed for us and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our prepaid and accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated prepaid and accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to CROs in connection with clinical trials, CMOs with respect to pre-clinical and clinical materials and intermediaries and vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.\nWe base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services performed pursuant to contracts with clinical sites that conduct clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of required data submission. In recording service fees, we make estimates based upon the time period over which services will be performed or other observable and measureable progress points as defined in the contracts, such as number of subjects enrolled, number of sites, or quantity of services performed in each period. The calculated amount of service fee expense is compared to the actual payments made pursuant to the contract's billing schedule to determine the resulting prepaid or accrual position. Additionally, for each clinical site, we accrue 10% of the earned amounts which is payable upon completion of the required data submission for the clinical trial. If our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there has been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have applied the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\"), Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718\"), to account for stock-based compensation for employees and ASC 718 and FASB ASC Topic 505, Equity (\"ASC 505\"), for non-employees. We recognize\ncompensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Stock compensation related to non-employee awards is re-measured at each reporting period until the awards are vested.\nDetermining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock-based awards as of their measurement date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the award. Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the fair value of our common stock on the measurement date, the expected term of our stock options, the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Because of our limited operating history as a publicly traded entity, we utilize data from a representative group of publicly traded companies to estimate expected stock price volatility. We selected representative companies from the biopharmaceutical industry with characteristics similar to us. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment as we do not have sufficient historical stock option activity data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. For non-employee grants, we use an expected term equal to the remaining contractual term of the award. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention of paying cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life.\nUnder ASC 718, we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from its estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the differences are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.\nStock-based compensation expense includes options granted to employees and non-employees and has been reported in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as follows (in thousands):\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe estimated the fair value of stock options of each employee stock award at the grant date using assumptions regarding the fair value of the underlying common stock on each grant date and the following additional assumptions:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected Volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.5%-85.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.2%-103.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.56%-1.94%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75%-2.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.59%-1.83%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.50 - 6.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $8.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of related forfeiture estimates, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately three years. Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options has increased primarily based upon headcount growth and the related number of stock option awards granted to new and existing employees.\nFollowing the closing of our IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Prior to the closing of our IPO, we utilized significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of our common stock for periods. We granted stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock as determined by the board of directors, with input from management. The board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock based on a number of objective and subjective factors, including external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector and the prices at which we sold shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock, the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to our common stock at the time and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or sale of our company.\nFor periods prior to the closing of our IPO, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock considering, in part, the work of an independent third-party valuation specialist. The board determined the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates considering valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, also known as the Practice Aid. We engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to perform contemporaneous valuations as of December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013, July 25, 2013, August 12, 2013 and October 21, 2013 and a retrospective valuation as of March 6, 2013. In conducting the valuations, the independent third-party valuation specialist considered all objective and subjective factors that it believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted in accordance with the Practice Aid, including our best estimate of our business condition, prospects and operating performance at each valuation date. Significant changes to the key assumptions used in the valuations could have resulted in different fair values of common stock at each valuation date.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,366\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,160\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,117\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,117\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42,483\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGrant revenue\nGrant revenue increased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.7 million from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to a full year of activities performed related to a $1.2 million grant entered into with the Gates Foundation in September 2014.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses increased approximately $4.3 million to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $23.7 million for the same period ended December 31, 2014. This net increase was attributable to increases of $2.1 million in R&D personnel costs, approximately $1.8 million in lab-related and facilities costs and other general increases to support research activities offset by a $1.0 million decrease in clinical costs and licensing payments. R&D headcount has increased by more than 55% to support the clinical and manufacturing activities related to our Phase 2 trials, along with hiring to support our oncology and other research programs. The decline in both clinical costs and licensing payments related to the relative timing of major clinical activities and milestones in 2015 versus 2014.\nOn a program basis, GEN-003 costs increased by $0.4 million largely due to (i) the ongoing Phase 2 dose optimization that began in the second half of 2014 (ii) costs incurred to drive improvements in the manufacturing process for GEN-003 to enable production at commercial scale, and (iii) costs related to the initiation of patient screening for a 135-subject Phase 2b study in the fourth quarter of 2015. Pre-clinical R&D increased by $5.4 million as we accelerated our investment in immuno-oncology research and collaborations and increased spending on our other product candidates and the development of the\nATLAS technology platform. These increases were offset by a $1.5 million cost decrease in GEN-004 due to our fourth quarter decision to suspend investment in this program.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $4.2 million to $14.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from $9.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due largely to additional personnel costs of $2.3 million attributable to higher headcount, increases in depreciation costs of approximately $0.4 million due to capital additions and expansion of our offices, and a $0.4 million increase in consulting and professional services mainly due to the recruitment and hiring activities that occurred during 2015. The remaining $1.1 million increase is generally attributable to higher public company overhead costs.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense decreased $1.2 million to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to a non-recurring adjustment recorded in the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 to the fair value of warrants to purchase preferred stock as a result of an increase in the fair value of the underlying stock both before and on the date of the completion of our IPO on February 10, 2014. Additionally, in the fourth quarter end December 31, 2014, we incurred a $0.4 million loss on our debt extinguishment of a term note.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net increased $0.1 million to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $1.0 million for the same period ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due primarily to higher average principal balances on our outstanding debt for the year to date period in 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 offset by higher levels of interest income on our investment portfolio.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(423\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,925\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,160\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(422\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(738\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(459\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(511\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(881\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,249\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,806\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGrant revenue\nGrant revenue decreased $0.4 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was due to the completion of a grant to fund research for our pneumococcus program during 2013. In September 2014, we received $1.2 million from a grant entered into with the Gates Foundation. We recognized $0.3 million in revenue under the agreement in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nResearch and development expenses\nR&D expense increased $8.0 million to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was attributable to: an increase of $2.4 million in R&D personnel costs, including $1.2 million in stock-based compensation; an increase of $0.4 million in licensing milestones related to the start of\nGEN-003 and GEN-004 Phase 2 clinical studies; an increase of $2.8 million in GEN-003 external costs, reflecting increased manufacturing costs and clinical trial costs; and an increase of $2.4 million in GEN-004 external costs, reflecting manufacturing costs and clinical trial costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nG&A expense increased $4.7 million to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to additional personnel costs in 2014 of $2.0 million, including $1.0 million in increased stock-based compensation due to the vesting of certain performance-based common stock options; $1.1 million in increased audit, legal and consulting expenses; and $0.7 million in public company overhead costs.\nOther expense, net\nOther expenses increased $0.8 million to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due to an increase in the fair value of warrants to purchase preferred stock as a result of an increase in the fair value of the underlying stock both before and on the date of the completion of our IPO on February 10, 2014. Additionally, an increase of $0.2 million related to the loss on debt extinguishment of a term note.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net increased $0.5 million to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due primarily to higher average principal balances related to our term loan in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nSince our inception through December 31, 2015, we have received an aggregate of $278.8 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and gross proceeds from debt facilities and an aggregate of $7.9 million from grants. At December 31, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and investments were $106.4 million, comprised of $17.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $89.2 million of investments.\nIn February 2014, we completed an IPO of 5.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $12.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $66.0 million. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $61.4 million, after deducting approximately $4.6 million in underwriting discounts and commission, excluding offering costs payable by us.\nIn March 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6.3 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.25 per share for an aggregate offering price of $51.7 million. In August 2015, we completed another underwritten public offering of 3.9 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $50.1 million. We received net proceeds from these offerings of approximately $95.7 million, after deducting approximately $6.1 million in underwriting discounts and commissions, excluding offering costs payable by us.\nDebt Financings\nOn November 20, 2014 (the \"Closing Date\"), we entered into a loan and security agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d) with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d) which provided up to $27.0 million in debt financing in three separate tranches ( 2014 Term Loan\u201d). The first tranche of $17.0 million was available through June 30, 2015, of which $12.0 million was drawn down at loan inception for which approximately $9.8 million of the proceeds were used to repay the previously existing $10.0 million loan agreement (the \"2013 Term Loan\"). We recorded a $435 thousand loss on extinguishment of debt in other expense on the Statements of Operations related to deferred debt charges, the unamortized portion of the original issue discount related to the 2013 Term Loan and other fees associated with extinguishing the debt. The option to draw down the remaining $5.0 million under the first tranche expired unused on June 30, 2015. The second tranche of $5.0 million was subject to certain eligibility requirements which were achieved as of June 30, 2015 and we had the option to draw down the second tranche on or prior to December 15, 2015. The second tranche expired unused on December 15, 2015 The third tranche of $5.0 million was not eligible to draw as we did not achieve positive results from its Phase 2a human challenge study of GEN-004.\nIn December 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement (the \"First Amendment\") with Hercules. The First Amendment required us to draw an additional $5.0 million and permits us to draw two additional $5.0 million tranches. One $5.0 million tranche is immediately available to draw through December 15, 2016 and a second $5.0 million tranche becomes available through December 15, 2016, subject to us demonstrating sufficient evidence of continued clinical progression of our GEN-003 product and making favorable progress in applying our proprietary technology platform toward the development of novel immunotherapies with application in oncology. At December 31, 2015, $17.0 million was outstanding under the amended 2014 Term Loan.\nDuring the amendment negotiations, but after the third quarter Form 10-Q was filed, we identified three separate covenant violations that resulted in an event of default as of September 30, 2015. The violated covenants related to certain investments the Company held as well as certain financial reporting obligations. Pursuant to the 2014 Term Loan, upon an event of default, Hercules can accelerate the repayment of all amounts due under the 2014 Term Loan at their discretion. Hercules did not make a repayment demand and the First Amendment included a permanent waiver of these covenant violations subject only to certain requirements that are within our control. The First Amendment also modified the Loan Agreement for the specific instances in which these violations arose, including redefining permitted investments to be in line with our approved investment policies.\nThe 2014 Term Loan had an original maturity of July 1, 2018. The eligibility requirements for the second tranche also contained an election for us to extend the maturity date to January 1, 2019. During the second quarter of 2015, we elected to extend the maturity date of the 2014 Term Loan. The maturity date of January 1, 2019 remained unchanged by the First Amendment.\nEach advance accrues interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.25% or (ii) the sum of 7.25% plus the prime rate minus 5.0%. The 2014 Term Loan provided for interest-only payments until December 31, 2015, which was extended by us for a six-month period as the eligibility requirements for the second tranche were met during the second quarter of 2015. The First Amendment subsequently extended the interest only period through June 30, 2017. Thereafter, beginning July 1, 2017, principal and interest payments will be made monthly for 18 months with a payoff schedule based upon a 30-month amortization schedule, the original amortization term of the 2014 Term Loan. The remaining unpaid principal is due at January 1, 2019.\nThe 2014 Term Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part upon seven business days' prior written notice to Hercules. Prepayments will be subject to a charge of 3.0% if an advance is prepaid within 12 months following the Closing Date, 2.0%, if an advance is prepaid between 12 and 24 months following the Closing Date, and 1.0% thereafter. Amounts outstanding at the time of an event of default shall be payable on demand and shall accrue interest at an additional rate of 5.0% per annum on any outstanding amounts past due. We also are obligated to pay Hercules an end of term charge of 4.95% of the balance drawn when the advances are repaid.\nIn connection with the 2014 Term Loan, we issued a common stock warrant to Hercules on November 20, 2014. The warrant is exercisable for 73,725 shares of our common stock (equal to $607,500 divided by the exercise price of $8.24).\nOperating Capital Requirements\nOur primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be for the near future, compensation and related expenses, manufacturing costs for pre-clinical and clinical materials, third party clinical trial R&D services, laboratory and related supplies, clinical costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities at December 31, 2015 are sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2017. Through this timeframe, we expect to have results from multiple Phase 2 GEN-003 studies, including the twelve-month data from our ongoing dose optimization clinical trial, data from a Phase 2b study designed to confirm the efficacy of GEN-003 manufactured at commercial scale, and data from a study to investigate the potential benefits of using GEN-003 in combination with oral antiviral medicines. In the second half of 2016, we also expect to have conducted our FDA end of Phase 2 meeting for GEN-003 for genital herpes to enable the initiation of a Phase 3 program in the second half of 2017. We have suspended the development of GEN-004 from our near-term plans and will focus our resources on the ongoing Phase 2 program for GEN-003 and on maximizing the potential of our preclinical pipeline and our ATLAS technology for T cell target discovery. We expect that these funds will not be sufficient to enable us to seek marketing approval or commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties\nassociated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the timing and costs of our ongoing and planned clinical trials for GEN-003;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the progress, timing and costs of manufacturing GEN-003 for current and planned clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates and potential product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs of commercialization activities for GEN-003 and other product candidates if we receive marketing approval, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the receipt of marketing approval, revenue received from commercial sales of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the terms and timing of any future collaborations, grants, licensing, consulting or other arrangements that we may establish;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights, including milestone and royalty payments and patent prosecution fees that we are obligated to pay pursuant to our license agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the extent to which we in-license or acquire other products and technologies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to commercialize GEN-003 and our other product candidates in order to receive regulatory approval. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be materially diluted and the terms of these securities could include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of GEN-003 or our other product candidates, seek collaborators at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available, and relinquish or license, potentially on unfavorable terms, our rights to GEN-003 or our other product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,937\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,799\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operations increased $10.8 million to $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due primarily to increases in (i) the net loss of approximately $7.2 million, (ii) accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.0 million, and (iii) stock based compensation of $0.9 million, offset by decreases in deferred revenue of $1.6 million and fair value of warrant liability of $0.7 million, along with other changes in our working capital accounts.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $36.4 million to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due largely to a net $35.1 million increase in investments and an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $36.5 million to $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due largely to $35.2 million in higher net proceeds from two follow-on public offerings in 2015 compared to the proceeds from IPO in 2014, $3.4 million of additional borrowing proceeds primarily related to the First Amendment, both offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in proceeds from other common stock issuances that occurred in 2014.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,873\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(389\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operations increased $7.7 million to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due primarily to an increase in the net loss of approximately $14.5 million, partially offset by an increase of $0.2 million on loss on debt extinguishment, an increase in stock based compensation of $2.2 million, an increase in change in fair value of warrant liability of $0.5 million, an increase in non-cash interest expense of $0.2 million, an increase in depreciation expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $3.4 million in our working capital accounts.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $28.2 million to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due largely to the purchase of marketable securities of $27.1 million and an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.1 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $43.0 million to $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due largely to the net proceeds from our IPO in 2014 of $60.0 million, net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $11.8 million, net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $2.0 million, an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of $0.6 million, and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") of $0.1 million, which was partially offset by the issuance of preferred stock of $15.3 million in 2013, the issuance of long-term debt of $10.0 million in 2013, and an increase in repayments of long-term debt of $6.2 million, which was due to the debt refinancing in November 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nAt December 31, 2015, we had United States federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $143.8 million and $128.5 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2035. At December 31, 2015, we had federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards of approximately $3.7 million and $2.4 million available, respectively, to reduce future tax liabilities which expire at various dates through 2035. Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities and may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of our company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. At December 31, 2015, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our net operating loss and R&D tax credit carryforwards, as we believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be fully realized. In the future, if we determine that a portion or all of the tax benefits associated with our tax carryforwards will be realized, net income would increase in the period of determination.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of $17.0 million in long-term debt due consisting of amounts due under the 2014 Term Loan.

We have included $0.8 million in this table for the end of term charge based upon the debt outstanding at December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In February 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc. (\"Fujifilm\") for the manufacture and supply of certain antigens for its GEN-003 clinical program. Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay Fujifilm manufacturing milestones, in addition to reimbursement of certain production related costs, as production occurs. Additionally, the agreement required the payment of a reservation fee, which will equal a percentage of the expected production fees, to reserve manufacturing slots in the production timeframe. There are no minimum purchase obligations and we may cancel the agreement at any point subject to certain cancellation charges that may be applicable based upon the cancellation date and the start of production along with the payment for services rendered through the date of cancellation. The Company has incurred expenses of $4.1 million under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn October 2014, we entered a product development and clinical supply agreement with Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions LLC (\"Baxter\"). The product development and clinical supply agreement provides the terms and conditions under which Baxter will formulate, fill, inspect, package, label and test our lead product, GEN-003 for clinical supply. We are obligated to pay Baxter for each batch of GEN-003 manufactured. Additionally, certain set-up fees and equipment purchased for the purposes of batch production will be invoiced separately by Baxter. We are also responsible for the payment of a monthly service fee for project management services for the duration of the arrangement. There are no minimum purchase obligations and we may cancel the agreement at any point subject to payment for services rendered through the date of cancellation. The Company has incurred expenses of $702 thousand under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe also have obligations to make future payments to third party licensors that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet or in the table above because the achievement and timing of these milestones is not fixed or determinable. These additional contractual commitments include the following:\nLicense Agreement with The Regents of the University of California. Under our license agreement with The Regents of the University of California (\"UC\"), in respect of UC patent rights covering aspects of our ATLAS discovery platform, we agreed to pay UC low single digit royalties on net sales by us of vaccine products comprising antigens identified through use of the ATLAS discovery platform covered by licensed UC patent rights. If we sublicense UC patent rights, we will owe UC a percentage of sublicensing revenue, including any royalty paid to us on net sales by sublicensees.\nLicense Agreement with Harvard. Under our license agreement with President and Fellows of Harvard College (\"Harvard\"), in respect of Harvard patent rights covering certain chlamydia antigens, we agreed to pay Harvard royalties in the high single-digits on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees of vaccine products comprising such chlamydia antigens. In addition, we are required to pay Harvard specified milestone payments for development of the first such chlamydia vaccine. Under the same license agreement, in respect of patent rights covering aspects of our antigen discovery platform, we agreed to pay Harvard royalties in the low single-digits on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees, for a period of 10 years from first commercial sale, of vaccine products comprising antigens (other than chlamydia antigens above) identified through use of the antigen discovery platform covered by licensed Harvard patent rights. In addition, we are required to pay Harvard specified milestone payments for development of such vaccines. We do not expect to make milestone payments in 2016 under this agreement. If we sublicense Harvard patent rights, we will owe Harvard a percentage of sublicensing revenue, excluding payments we receive based on the level of sales or profits. We notified Harvard of our partial termination of the license agreement with regard to the chlamydia antigens on December 8, 2014. Effective March 8, 2015, the license agreement with Harvard with regard to the chlamydia antigens was terminated and we no longer hold a license to two of the three in-licensed Harvard patent families, or to a chlamydia antigen covered by the remaining family. The remaining family covers certain aspects of the ATLAS platform, as well as one chlamydia antigen, and we continue to maintain exclusive rights to aspects of the ATLAS platform covered by this family.\nLicense Agreement with Novavax. Under our license agreement with Isconova AB, now Novavax, Inc., in respect of Novavax patent rights and trademarks covering adjuvant Matrix-M, we agreed to pay Novavax tranched royalties in the low single-digits on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees of vaccine products comprising our antigens and Matrix-M. In addition, we are required to pay Novavax specified milestone payments for development and commercialization of the first vaccine in each unique disease field. We do not expect to make milestone payments in 2016 under this agreement. If we sublicense Novavax patent rights, we will owe Novavax a percentage of the initial signing or upfront sublicensing fees we receive.\nLicense Agreement with Children's Medical Center Corporation. Under our license agreement with Children's Medical Center Corporation (\"Children's\"), in respect of Children's rights in jointly-owned patent rights covering certain Streptococcus antigens, we agreed to pay Children's low single digit royalties on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees of vaccine products comprising such Streptococcus antigens. In addition, we are required to pay Children's specified milestone payments for development and commercialization of such vaccines. We do not expect to make milestone payments in 2016 under this agreement. If we sublicense the jointly-owned patent rights, we will owe Children's a percentage of sublicensing revenue, excluding payments we receive based on the level of sales or profits.\nWe also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for preclinical safety and research studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and do not include any minimum purchase commitments, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table above.\nJOBS Act\nIn April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted in the United States. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth public companies.", "item_7_truncated": "Accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops novel vaccines and immunotherapies to address diseases with significant unmet needs.

Subjects were randomized to one of six dosing groups of either 30\u03bcg or 60\u03bcg per protein paired with one of three Matrix-M2TM adjuvant doses (25\u03bcg, 50\u03bcg, or 75\u03bcg). A seventh group received placebo. Subjects received three doses of GEN-003 or placebo at 21-day intervals. Baseline viral shedding and genital lesion rates were established for each subject in a 28-day observation period prior to the commencement of dosing by collecting 56 genital swab samples (two per day), which were analyzed for the presence of HSV-2 DNA, and by recording the days on which genital lesions were present. During the 28-day observation period immediately after completion of dosing, the best dose of 60\u03bcg per protein/75\u03bcg of adjuvant demonstrated a highly statistically significant (p<0.0001) 55% reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rate, the primary endpoint of the trial and a measure of anti-viral activity. All dose combinations tested, including the successful 30\u03bcg per protein/50\u03bcg of adjuvant dose from the prior Phase 1/2a trial, demonstrated a statistically significant viral shedding rate reduction versus baseline and only the lowest dose combination did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction versus placebo. In a planned secondary analysis to assess impact on patient reported genital lesion rates, all dose groups, including the placebo group, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline. Furthermore, there was no difference in discontinuations in patient dosing due to AEs across the different treatment arms.\nOperating Activities\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,937\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,799\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicense Agreement with Children's Medical Center Corporation. Under our license agreement with Children's Medical Center Corporation (\"Children's\"), in respect of Children's rights in jointly-owned patent rights covering certain Streptococcus antigens, we agreed to pay Children's low single digit royalties on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees of vaccine products comprising such Streptococcus antigens. In addition, we are required to pay Children's specified milestone payments for development and commercialization of such vaccines. We do not expect to make milestone payments in 2016 under this agreement. If we sublicense the jointly-owned patent rights, we will owe Children's a percentage of sublicensing revenue, excluding payments we receive based on the level of sales or profits.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities at December 31, 2015 are sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2017. Through this timeframe, we expect to have results from multiple Phase 2 GEN-003 studies, including the twelve-month data from our ongoing dose optimization clinical trial, data from a Phase 2b study designed to confirm the efficacy of GEN-003 manufactured at commercial scale, and data from a study to investigate the potential benefits of using GEN-003 in combination with oral antiviral medicines. In the second half of 2016, we also expect to have conducted our FDA end of Phase 2 meeting for GEN-003 for genital herpes to enable the initiation of a Phase 3 program in the second half of 2017. We have suspended the development of GEN-004 from our near-term plans and will focus our resources on the ongoing Phase 2 program for GEN-003 and on maximizing the potential of our preclinical pipeline and our ATLAS technology for T cell target discovery. We expect that these funds will not be sufficient to enable us to seek marketing approval or commercialize any of our product candidates.\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2)Includes costs related to other product candidates and certain technology platform development costs related to ATLAS.\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,873\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(389\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 facility costs, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies. \nThe following table identifies research and development expenses on a program-specific basis for our product candidates (in thousands):\nIn the second half of 2016, we intend to commence a Phase 2b study to investigate the potential benefits of using GEN-003 in combination with oral antiviral medicines. We also intend to conduct an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in late 2016. We retain all rights to GEN-003 and plan to advance this program through regulatory approval and, if approved, commercialize this vaccine through a focused commercial effort in the United States. Outside the United States, we intend to evaluate partnerships for GEN-003 opportunistically.\nThe 2014 Term Loan had an original maturity of July 1, 2018. The eligibility requirements for the second tranche also contained an election for us to extend the maturity date to January 1, 2019.

We initiated a 98-subject\nIn October 2015, we announced positive results from a planned interim analysis of data collected six months after dosing. At its best performing dose of 60\u00b5g per protein / 75\u00b5g of adjuvant, GEN-003 demonstrated a statistically significant 58% reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rate (p < 0.0001). In a planned secondary analysis, the proportion of patients receiving GEN-003 who were lesion-free at six months after dosing ranged from approximately 30% to 50%, similar to results reported in clinical trials with oral antiviral therapies. In addition, the time to first recurrence after completion of dosing showed a range of 152 days to greater than 180 days among dose groups. In a further secondary analysis measuring the impact on genital lesion rates, GEN-003 demonstrated sustained and statistically significant reductions from baseline in five of six dose groups ranging from 43% to 69%. The Phase 2 trial continues to show that GEN-003 is safe and well tolerated by patients, with no serious adverse events related to the vaccine. Data from the 12-month observation period in this trial is expected later in the first quarter of 2016.\nOther expense, net\nWe have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties\nOperating Capital Requirements\nGrant revenue\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nIn April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted in the United States. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth public companies.\nOn November 20, 2014 (the \"Closing Date\"), we entered into a loan and security agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d) with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d) which provided up to $27.0 million in debt financing in three separate tranches ( 2014 Term Loan\u201d). The first tranche of $17.0 million was available through June 30, 2015, of which $12.0 million was drawn down at loan inception for which approximately $9.8 million of the proceeds were used to repay the previously existing $10.0 million loan agreement (the \"2013 Term Loan\"). We recorded a $435 thousand loss on extinguishment of debt in other expense on the Statements of Operations related to deferred debt charges, the unamortized portion of the original issue discount related to the 2013 Term Loan and other fees associated with extinguishing the debt. The option to draw down the remaining $5.0 million under the first tranche expired unused on June 30, 2015. The second tranche of $5.0 million was subject to certain eligibility requirements which were achieved as of June 30, 2015 and we had the option to draw down the second tranche on or prior to December 15, 2015. The second tranche expired unused on December 15, 2015 The third tranche of $5.0 million was not eligible to draw as we did not achieve positive results from its Phase 2a human challenge study of GEN-004.\nIn November 2015, we also announced a collaboration with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to screen the T cell responses of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with CPIs against the complete repertoire of patient-specific putative cancer neoantigens. The goals of the collaboration are to identify signatures of T cell response in cancer patients associated with response or non-response to CPI therapy and to discover new T cell cancer vaccine antigens. ATLAS will be used in conjunction with Memorial Sloan Kettering's patient-specific cancer neoantigen sequences and blood samples from the same cancer patients.\n_________________________\nFollowing the closing of our IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Prior to the closing of our IPO, we utilized significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of our common stock for periods. We granted stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock as determined by the board of directors, with input from management. The board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock based on a number of objective and subjective factors, including external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector and the prices at which we sold shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock, the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to our common stock at the time and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or sale of our company.\nWe also have obligations to make future payments to third party licensors that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet or in the table above because the achievement and timing of these milestones is not fixed or determinable. These additional contractual commitments include the following:\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $28.2 million to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due largely to the purchase of marketable securities of $27.1 million and an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.1 million.\nIn March 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6.3 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.25 per share for an aggregate offering price of $51.7 million. In August 2015, we completed another underwritten public offering of 3.9 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $50.1 million. We received net proceeds from these offerings of approximately $95.7 million, after deducting approximately $6.1 million in underwriting discounts and commissions, excluding offering costs payable by us.\nassociated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nGrant revenue decreased $0.4 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was due to the completion of a grant to fund research for our pneumococcus program during 2013. In September 2014, we received $1.2 million from a grant entered into with the Gates Foundation. We recognized $0.3 million in revenue under the agreement in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nResearch and development expenses\nOther expense decreased $1.2 million to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to a non-recurring adjustment recorded in the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 to the fair value of warrants to purchase preferred stock as a result of an increase in the fair value of the underlying stock both before and on the date of the completion of our IPO on February 10, 2014. Additionally, in the fourth quarter end December 31, 2014, we incurred a $0.4 million loss on our debt extinguishment of a term note.\nresult, the Company no longer recorded fair value adjustments for its warrants. Other expense also consists of loss on debt extinguishment.\nDebt Financings\nFinancing Activities\nWe have no products approved for sale. We will not receive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products or until we potentially enter into agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of product candidates. If our development efforts for any of our product candidates result in regulatory approval or we enter into collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue from product sales or from such third parties.\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $43.0 million to $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due largely to the net proceeds from our IPO in 2014 of $60.0 million, net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $11.8 million, net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $2.0 million, an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of $0.6 million, and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") of $0.1 million, which was partially offset by the issuance of preferred stock of $15.3 million in 2013, the issuance of long-term debt of $10.0 million in 2013, and an increase in repayments of long-term debt of $6.2 million, which was due to the debt refinancing in November 2014.\n\nWe have one product candidate in active Phase 2 clinical development, GEN-003, an immunotherapy for the treatment of genital herpes. We have another product candidate, GEN-004, a universal vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal infections, for which we have suspended development pending further data analysis and consultation with our advisers after we did not achieve statistically significant results in our Phase 2a human challenge study. We also have active research and pre-clinical development programs for diseases including genital herpes, chlamydia and malaria. We are also investigating the application of ATLAS to immuno-oncology target discovery.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support the continued research and development of our product candidates and to operate as a public company. These increases will likely include higher costs for insurance, hiring activities, and professional services, such as outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of our first product candidate appears likely, we anticipate that we will increase our salary and personnel costs and other expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations.\nGrant revenue increased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.7 million from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to a full year of activities performed related to a $1.2 million grant entered into with the Gates Foundation in September 2014.\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses increased approximately $4.3 million to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $23.7 million for the same period ended December 31, 2014. This net increase was attributable to increases of $2.1 million in R&D personnel costs, approximately $1.8 million in lab-related and facilities costs and other general increases to support research activities offset by a $1.0 million decrease in clinical costs and licensing payments. R&D headcount has increased by more than 55% to support the clinical and manufacturing activities related to our Phase 2 trials, along with hiring to support our oncology and other research programs. The decline in both clinical costs and licensing payments related to the relative timing of major clinical activities and milestones in 2015 versus 2014.\nWe initiated a research collaboration with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (\"DFCI\") in 2014 to apply the ATLAS platform in immuno-oncology. This collaboration centered on ATLAS's potential to identify patterns of T cell response in cancer patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor (\"CPI\") therapy. By analyzing the immune responses of both responders and non-responders to CPI therapy, ATLAS successfully identified the cancer antigens to which either (or both) CD4+ or CD8+ T cells became activated. While this research was not powered to draw firm conclusions, the analysis of T cell responses in patients receiving CPI therapy revealed a pattern indicating a greater breadth of T cell activation for responders than non-responders. The study also revealed preliminary evidence that different characteristics of T cell responses emerge when comparing patients who respond and those who do not. Some T cell responses did not correspond with improved patient outcomes, and may be classified as decoys,\u201d further validating the ability of ATLAS to distinguish clinically relevant targets of T cell response. The collaboration with DFCI is ongoing as we continue to analyze more tumor samples to characterize T cell response profiles that may be prognostic of CPI efficacy, and to identify T cell antigens that may be included in novel immunotherapies.\n(1)Includes direct and indirect internal costs and external costs such as CMO and CRO costs.\nfinanced our operations through the issuance of our equity securities, debt financings and amounts received through grants. As of December 31, 2015, we had received an aggregate of $278.8 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and gross proceeds from debt facilities and an aggregate of $7.9 million from grants. At December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investments were $106.4 million.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had United States federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $143.8 million and $128.5 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2035. At December 31, 2015, we had federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards of approximately $3.7 million and $2.4 million available, respectively, to reduce future tax liabilities which expire at various dates through 2035. Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities and may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of our company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. At December 31, 2015, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our net operating loss and R&D tax credit carryforwards, as we believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be fully realized. In the future, if we determine that a portion or all of the tax benefits associated with our tax carryforwards will be realized, net income would increase in the period of determination.\nSince our inception through December 31, 2015, we have received an aggregate of $278.8 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and gross proceeds from debt facilities and an aggregate of $7.9 million from grants. At December 31, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and investments were $106.4 million, comprised of $17.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $89.2 million of investments.\n\n\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2015 are sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2017. Through this timeframe, we expect to have results from multiple Phase 2 GEN-003 studies including the twelve-month data from our ongoing dose optimization clinical trial, a Phase 2b study to test the efficacy of GEN-003 following changes in the manufacturing process to allow for production at commercial scale and a study to investigate the potential benefits of using GEN-003 in combination with oral antiviral medicines. In late 2016, we also expect to have conducted our FDA end of Phase 2 meeting for GEN-003 and we expect to commence Phase 3 studies in the second half of 2017. However, costs related to clinical trials can be unpredictable and therefore there can be no guarantee that our current balances of cash, cash equivalents and investments, and any proceeds received from other sources, will be sufficient to fund our studies or operations through this period. These funds will not be sufficient to enable us to conduct pivotal clinical trials for, seek marketing approval for or commercially launch GEN-003 or any other product candidate. Accordingly, to obtain marketing approval for and to commercialize these or any other product candidates, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital when needed would have a negative effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nContractual Obligations\nGrant revenue\nWe base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services performed pursuant to contracts with clinical sites that conduct clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of required data submission. In recording service fees, we make estimates based upon the time period over which services will be performed or other observable and measureable progress points as defined in the contracts, such as number of subjects enrolled, number of sites, or quantity of services performed in each period. The calculated amount of service fee expense is compared to the actual payments made pursuant to the contract's billing schedule to determine the resulting prepaid or accrual position. Additionally, for each clinical site, we accrue 10% of the earned amounts which is payable upon completion of the required data submission for the clinical trial. If our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there has been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nGEN-004 - Universal vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal infections\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $4.2 million to $14.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from $9.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due largely to additional personnel costs of $2.3 million attributable to higher headcount, increases in depreciation costs of approximately $0.4 million due to capital additions and expansion of our offices, and a $0.4 million increase in consulting and professional services mainly due to the recruitment and hiring activities that occurred during 2015. The remaining $1.1 million increase is generally attributable to higher public company overhead costs.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which include, but are not limited to, estimates related to clinical trial accruals, prepaid and accrued research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, common stock warrants, warrants to purchase redeemable securities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates or assumptions.\n \u2022 the terms and timing of any future collaborations, grants, licensing, consulting or other arrangements that we may establish; \nStock-based compensation expense includes options granted to employees and non-employees and has been reported in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as follows (in thousands):\nOther expense, net\nWe estimated the fair value of stock options of each employee stock award at the grant date using assumptions regarding the fair value of the underlying common stock on each grant date and the following additional assumptions:\n \u2022 costs of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials and lab supplies; and \nThe 2014 Term Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part upon seven business days' prior written notice to Hercules. Prepayments will be subject to a charge of 3.0% if an advance is prepaid within 12 months following the Closing Date, 2.0%, if an advance is prepaid between 12 and 24 months following the Closing Date, and 1.0% thereafter. Amounts outstanding at the time of an event of default shall be payable on demand and shall accrue interest at an additional rate of 5.0% per annum on any outstanding amounts past due. We also are obligated to pay Hercules an end of term charge of 4.95% of the balance drawn when the advances are repaid.\nIn December 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement (the \"First Amendment\") with Hercules. The First Amendment required us to draw an additional $5.0 million and permits us to draw two additional $5.0 million tranches. One $5.0 million tranche is immediately available to draw through December 15, 2016 and a second $5.0 million tranche becomes available through December 15, 2016, subject to us demonstrating sufficient evidence of continued clinical progression of our GEN-003 product and making favorable progress in applying our proprietary technology platform toward the development of novel immunotherapies with application in oncology. At December 31, 2015, $17.0 million was outstanding under the amended 2014 Term Loan.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $36.5 million to $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due largely to $35.2 million in higher net proceeds from two follow-on public offerings in 2015 compared to the proceeds from IPO in 2014, $3.4 million of additional borrowing proceeds primarily related to the First Amendment, both offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in proceeds from other common stock issuances that occurred in 2014.\nGEN-003 and GEN-004 Phase 2 clinical studies; an increase of $2.8 million in GEN-003 external costs, reflecting increased manufacturing costs and clinical trial costs; and an increase of $2.4 million in GEN-004 external costs, reflecting manufacturing costs and clinical trial costs.\nInterest expense, net\nFinancial Overview\nResearch and non-clinical development in oncology\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on our long-term debt facilities and non-cash interest related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by interest earned on our cash, cash equivalent and investment portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $8.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of related forfeiture estimates, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately three years. Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options has increased primarily based upon headcount growth and the related number of stock option awards granted to new and existing employees.\nOverview\n \u2022 the costs of commercialization activities for GEN-003 and other product candidates if we receive marketing approval, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; \nCash Flows\nStock-Based Compensation\nJOBS Act\nResults of Operations\nInvesting Activities\nGrant revenue consists of revenue earned to conduct vaccine development research. We have received grants from private not-for-profit organizations and federal agencies. These grants have related to the discovery and development of several of our product candidates, including product candidates for the prevention of pneumococcus, chlamydia, and malaria. Revenue under these grants is recognized as research services are performed. Funds received in advance of research services being performed are recorded as deferred revenue. We plan to continue to pursue grant funding, but there can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining such grants in the future.\nGrant revenue\nWe have ongoing non-clinical development programs in chlamydia and genital herpes prophylaxis and a research program funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (\"Gates Foundation\") in malaria.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn connection with the 2014 Term Loan, we issued a common stock warrant to Hercules on November 20, 2014. The warrant is exercisable for 73,725 shares of our common stock (equal to $607,500 divided by the exercise price of $8.24).\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in operations increased $10.8 million to $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due primarily to increases in (i) the net loss of approximately $7.2 million, (ii) accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.0 million, and (iii) stock based compensation of $0.9 million, offset by decreases in deferred revenue of $1.6 million and fair value of warrant liability of $0.7 million, along with other changes in our working capital accounts.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nInterest expense, net\n\nIn October 2015, we announced that top-line results from the Phase 2a clinical trial for GEN-004 showed consistent reductions versus placebo in the pre-specified endpoints of the rate and density of colonization, but that neither of the endpoints achieved statistical significance. GEN-004 was safe and well tolerated by subjects. GEN-004 reduced the colonization rate, measured by microbiological culture, by between 22% and 25% versus placebo across those measurement time points. When measured by the presence of pneumococcal DNA, the reductions ranged between 18% and 36%. Additionally the median density of colonization measured by microbiological culture for GEN-004 treated subjects ranged from zero to two colony forming units (\"CFUs\") per mL of nasal wash compared to one to 11 CFUs per mL for the placebo group. When measured by the presence of pneumococcal DNA, the median densities ranged from zero to 10 copies per mL in treated subjects and 19 to 52 copies per mL in placebo subjects. None of the differences were statistically significant. There was no difference in the duration of colonization between GEN-004 and placebo.\nHaving identified a dose that, according to company-sponsored market research, delivers clinically meaningful efficacy in magnitude and durability, we are now conducting a 310-subject Phase 2 dose optimization trial. The objective of this trial is to confirm the results of the best performing dose in the Phase 1/2a trial and to test six other combinations of proteins and adjuvant to determine the optimal dose for future trials and potentially improve on the current profile of GEN-003.\nIn March 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6.3 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.25 per share for an aggregate offering price of $51.7 million. In August 2015, we completed another underwritten public offering of 3.9 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $50.1 million. We received net proceeds from these offerings of approximately $95.7 million, after deducting approximately $6.1 million in underwriting discounts and commissions, excluding offering costs payable by us.\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our prepaid and accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed for us and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our prepaid and accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated prepaid and accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to CROs in connection with clinical trials, CMOs with respect to pre-clinical and clinical materials and intermediaries and vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.\nATLAS technology platform. These increases were offset by a $1.5 million cost decrease in GEN-004 due to our fourth quarter decision to suspend investment in this program.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section entitled Selected Financial Data\u201d and our financial statements and related notes appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and \nOther expense, net\n \u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire other products and technologies. \n\nResearch and non-clinical development in infectious disease\nWe also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for preclinical safety and research studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and do not include any minimum purchase commitments, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table above.\nIn November 2015, we commenced a new program focused on Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV\u201d). EBV infection has been linked to cancers with high unmet needs such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. We believe the ATLAS platform is highly suited to the creation of a new immunotherapy for EBV given that T cell responses are understood to be crucial for protection against EBV. Furthermore, EBV is part of the herpesvirus family, in which we have years of experience through our development of GEN-003.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe expense internal research and development costs to operations as incurred. We expense third party costs for research and development activities, such as conducting clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific performance or tasks such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information, which is provided to us by our vendors.\nOther expenses increased $0.8 million to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due to an increase in the fair value of warrants to purchase preferred stock as a result of an increase in the fair value of the underlying stock both before and on the date of the completion of our IPO on February 10, 2014. Additionally, an increase of $0.2 million related to the loss on debt extinguishment of a term note.\n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (\"CROs\"), contract manufacturing organizations (\"CMOs\"), consultants and other vendors that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical activities; \nResearch and development expenses\nPrepaid and Accrued Research and Development Expenses\nIn February 2014, we completed an IPO of 5.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $12.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $66.0 million. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $61.4 million, after deducting approximately $4.6 million in underwriting discounts and commission, excluding offering costs payable by us.\nWe commenced business operations in August 2006. To date, our operations have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring and developing our proprietary ATLAS technology, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates. All of our revenue to date has been grant revenue. We have not generated any product revenue and do not expect to do so for the foreseeable future. We have primarily\n \u2022 the receipt of marketing approval, revenue received from commercial sales of our product candidates; \nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n \u2022 the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; \nPhase 2a trial in September 2014 to demonstrate that GEN-004 can reduce the frequency, magnitude and duration of colonization of pneumococcus in the nasopharynx in healthy adults.\nWe expect that we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to commercialize GEN-003 and our other product candidates in order to receive regulatory approval. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be materially diluted and the terms of these securities could include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of GEN-003 or our other product candidates, seek collaborators at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available, and relinquish or license, potentially on unfavorable terms, our rights to GEN-003 or our other product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nWe have applied the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\"), Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718\"), to account for stock-based compensation for employees and ASC 718 and FASB ASC Topic 505, Equity (\"ASC 505\"), for non-employees. We recognize\nLicense Agreement with The Regents of the University of California. Under our license agreement with The Regents of the University of California (\"UC\"), in respect of UC patent rights covering aspects of our ATLAS discovery platform, we agreed to pay UC low single digit royalties on net sales by us of vaccine products comprising antigens identified through use of the ATLAS discovery platform covered by licensed UC patent rights. If we sublicense UC patent rights, we will owe UC a percentage of sublicensing revenue, including any royalty paid to us on net sales by sublicensees.\nAlthough we did not achieve statistical significance in this study, the consistent apparent effect supports the vaccine concept and in the potential for GEN-004. We believe it is possible that future trials would require a change in some combination of dose, adjuvant or trial population to confirm any effect. Pending ongoing data analysis and consultation with our advisors to determine next steps for this program, we have suspended the development of GEN-004 from our near-term plans and will focus our resources on the ongoing GEN-003 program, and on maximizing the potential of our preclinical pipeline and our ATLAS technology for T cell target discovery.\nGEN-003 - Phase 2 immunotherapy for genital herpes\nIf GEN-003 successfully completes clinical development and is approved, we believe it would represent an important new treatment option for patients with genital herpes.\n \u2022 the timing and costs of our ongoing and planned clinical trials for GEN-003; \nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\n\nUnder ASC 718, we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from its estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the differences are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.\nResearch and development expenses\nOverview\nOur primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be for the near future, compensation and related expenses, manufacturing costs for pre-clinical and clinical materials, third party clinical trial R&D services, laboratory and related supplies, clinical costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.\nNet cash used in operations increased $7.7 million to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due primarily to an increase in the net loss of approximately $14.5 million, partially offset by an increase of $0.2 million on loss on debt extinguishment, an increase in stock based compensation of $2.2 million, an increase in change in fair value of warrant liability of $0.5 million, an increase in non-cash interest expense of $0.2 million, an increase in depreciation expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $3.4 million in our working capital accounts.\nWe expect that our revenue will be less than our expenses for the foreseeable future and that we will experience increasing losses as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. Our ability to generate revenue for each product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval will depend on numerous factors, including competition, commercial manufacturing capability and market acceptance of our products.\nOur lead program is GEN-003, a Phase 2 candidate therapeutic vaccine, or immunotherapy, that we are developing to treat genital herpes infections. Data from our double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating Phase 1/2a trial for GEN-003 represented the first reported instance of a therapeutic vaccine working against an infectious disease, and we have identified a dose in our Phase 2 trial which has showed an even greater reduction in viral shedding than the best dose in the Phase 1/2a trial.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nOn a program basis, GEN-003 costs increased by $0.4 million largely due to (i) the ongoing Phase 2 dose optimization that began in the second half of 2014 (ii) costs incurred to drive improvements in the manufacturing process for GEN-003 to enable production at commercial scale, and (iii) costs related to the initiation of patient screening for a 135-subject Phase 2b study in the fourth quarter of 2015. Pre-clinical R&D increased by $5.4 million as we accelerated our investment in immuno-oncology research and collaborations and increased spending on our other product candidates and the development of the\nR&D expense increased $8.0 million to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was attributable to: an increase of $2.4 million in R&D personnel costs, including $1.2 million in stock-based compensation; an increase of $0.4 million in licensing milestones related to the start of\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $42.5 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our accumulated deficit was $157.9 million as of December 31, 2015. We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the amendment negotiations, but after the third quarter Form 10-Q was filed, we identified three separate covenant violations that resulted in an event of default as of September 30, 2015. The violated covenants related to certain investments the Company held as well as certain financial reporting obligations. Pursuant to the 2014 Term Loan, upon an event of default, Hercules can accelerate the repayment of all amounts due under the 2014 Term Loan at their discretion. Hercules did not make a repayment demand and the First Amendment included a permanent waiver of these covenant violations subject only to certain requirements that are within our control. The First Amendment also modified the Loan Agreement for the specific instances in which these violations arose, including redefining permitted investments to be in line with our approved investment policies.\nIn October 2014, we entered a product development and clinical supply agreement with Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions LLC (\"Baxter\"). The product development and clinical supply agreement provides the terms and conditions under which Baxter will formulate, fill, inspect, package, label and test our lead product, GEN-003 for clinical supply. We are obligated to pay Baxter for each batch of GEN-003 manufactured. Additionally, certain set-up fees and equipment purchased for the purposes of batch production will be invoiced separately by Baxter. We are also responsible for the payment of a monthly service fee for project management services for the duration of the arrangement. There are no minimum purchase obligations and we may cancel the agreement at any point subject to payment for services rendered through the date of cancellation. The Company has incurred expenses of $702 thousand under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 the progress, timing and costs of manufacturing GEN-003 for current and planned clinical trials; \n \u2022 personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and travel; \nCertain classes of our preferred stock were redeemable beginning in 2017 at the original issuance price plus any declared or accrued but unpaid dividends upon written election of the preferred stockholders in accordance with the terms of our articles of incorporation. Accretion of preferred stock reflects the accretion of issuance costs and, for Series B preferred stock, cumulative dividends based on their respective redemption values. On February 10, 2014, we completed our IPO and all shares of preferred stock were converted into 11,466,479 shares of our Common Stock. No accretion of preferred stock is recorded after this date as no shares of preferred stock are outstanding.\n_________________________\nDetermining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock-based awards as of their measurement date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the award. Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the fair value of our common stock on the measurement date, the expected term of our stock options, the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Because of our limited operating history as a publicly traded entity, we utilize data from a representative group of publicly traded companies to estimate expected stock price volatility. We selected representative companies from the biopharmaceutical industry with characteristics similar to us. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment as we do not have sufficient historical stock option activity data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. For non-employee grants, we use an expected term equal to the remaining contractual term of the award. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention of paying cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life.\nFor periods prior to the closing of our IPO, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock considering, in part, the work of an independent third-party valuation specialist. The board determined the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates considering valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, also known as the Practice Aid. We engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to perform contemporaneous valuations as of December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013, July 25, 2013, August 12, 2013 and October 21, 2013 and a retrospective valuation as of March 6, 2013. In conducting the valuations, the independent third-party valuation specialist considered all objective and subjective factors that it believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted in accordance with the Practice Aid, including our best estimate of our business condition, prospects and operating performance at each valuation date. Significant changes to the key assumptions used in the valuations could have resulted in different fair values of common stock at each valuation date.\n\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nFollowing improvements that we have made to the manufacturing process for GEN-003 to enable production at commercial scale, we initiated patient screening in the fourth quarter of 2015 and commenced the dosing phase in January 2016 for a 135-subject Phase 2b study to confirm the efficacy of this new material. Subjects will be randomized to one of two dose levels of GEN-003 or a placebo. We expect to announce top-line viral shedding rate data from the 28-day observation period immediately after dosing from this study in the middle of 2016. The study will also compare GEN-003 efficacy to placebo for the clinical endpoints of: the proportion of patients who are lesion free at six and 12 months after dosing; the time to first lesion recurrence after dosing; and, the impact on percentage of days with genital herpes lesions at six and 12 months after dosing. Data from these six and 12 month clinical endpoints is expected in the second half of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. All subjects will be followed for 12 months after the last dose.\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses, in executive and other administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees associated with corporate and intellectual property legal expenses, consulting and accounting services.\n \u2022 the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates and potential product candidates; \nInterest expense, net increased $0.1 million to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $1.0 million for the same period ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due primarily to higher average principal balances on our outstanding debt for the year to date period in 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 offset by higher levels of interest income on our investment portfolio.\nFinal analysis of the data from the Phase 1/2a trial showed that, for the best performing 30\u00b5g dose group, there was a sustained reduction in the viral shedding rate. After completion of dosing for this group, the viral shedding rate fell by 52% versus baseline and, at six months after the final dose, the shedding rate remained at 40% below baseline. The reduction in the genital lesion rate after completion of the third dose was greatest for the 30\u00b5g dose group at 48%. After six months, the reduction from baseline in genital lesion rate for this dose group was 65% and, after 12 months, the genital lesion rate was 42% lower than baseline. GEN-003 was safe and well tolerated over the 12 months of this trial.\ncompensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Stock compensation related to non-employee awards is re-measured at each reporting period until the awards are vested.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nEach advance accrues interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.25% or (ii) the sum of 7.25% plus the prime rate minus 5.0%. The 2014 Term Loan provided for interest-only payments until December 31, 2015, which was extended by us for a six-month period as the eligibility requirements for the second tranche were met during the second quarter of 2015. The First Amendment subsequently extended the interest only period through June 30, 2017. Thereafter, beginning July 1, 2017, principal and interest payments will be made monthly for 18 months with a payoff schedule based upon a 30-month amortization schedule, the original amortization term of the 2014 Term Loan. The remaining unpaid principal is due at January 1, 2019.\nLicense Agreement with Harvard. Under our license agreement with President and Fellows of Harvard College (\"Harvard\"), in respect of Harvard patent rights covering certain chlamydia antigens, we agreed to pay Harvard royalties in the high single-digits on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees of vaccine products comprising such chlamydia antigens. In addition, we are required to pay Harvard specified milestone payments for development of the first such chlamydia vaccine. Under the same license agreement, in respect of patent rights covering aspects of our antigen discovery platform, we agreed to pay Harvard royalties in the low single-digits on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees, for a period of 10 years from first commercial sale, of vaccine products comprising antigens (other than chlamydia antigens above) identified through use of the antigen discovery platform covered by licensed Harvard patent rights. In addition, we are required to pay Harvard specified milestone payments for development of such vaccines. We do not expect to make milestone payments in 2016 under this agreement. If we sublicense Harvard patent rights, we will owe Harvard a percentage of sublicensing revenue, excluding payments we receive based on the level of sales or profits. We notified Harvard of our partial termination of the license agreement with regard to the chlamydia antigens on December 8, 2014. Effective March 8, 2015, the license agreement with Harvard with regard to the chlamydia antigens was terminated and we no longer hold a license to two of the three in-licensed Harvard patent families, or to a chlamydia antigen covered by the remaining family. The remaining family covers certain aspects of the ATLAS platform, as well as one chlamydia antigen, and we continue to maintain exclusive rights to aspects of the ATLAS platform covered by this family.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $36.4 million to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due largely to a net $35.1 million increase in investments and an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.3 million.\nInterest expense, net increased $0.5 million to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due primarily to higher average principal balances related to our term loan in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nOperating Activities\n (1) As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of $17.0 million in long-term debt due consisting of amounts due under the 2014 Term Loan. We are obligated to pay an end of term charge of 4.95% of the balance drawn when the principal balance is repaid. We have included $0.8 million in this table for the end of term charge based upon the debt outstanding at December 31, 2015.  In February 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc. (\"Fujifilm\") for the manufacture and supply of certain antigens for its GEN-003 clinical program. Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay Fujifilm manufacturing milestones, in addition to reimbursement of certain production related costs, as production occurs. Additionally, the agreement required the payment of a reservation fee, which will equal a percentage of the expected production fees, to reserve manufacturing slots in the production timeframe. There are no minimum purchase obligations and we may cancel the agreement at any point subject to certain cancellation charges that may be applicable based upon the cancellation date and the start of production along with the payment for services rendered through the date of cancellation. The Company has incurred expenses of $4.1 million under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2015.", "item_7_text": "Accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops novel vaccines and immunotherapies to address diseases with significant unmet needs. We use our proprietary discovery platform, ATLASTM, to rapidly design vaccines and immunotherapies that act, in part, through T cell (or cellular) immune responses, in contrast to approved vaccines and immunotherapies, which are designed to act primarily through B cell (or antibody) immune responses. We believe that by harnessing T cells we can develop first-in-class vaccines and immunotherapies to address diseases where T cells are central to the control of the disease.\nLicense Agreement with Novavax. Under our license agreement with Isconova AB, now Novavax, Inc., in respect of Novavax patent rights and trademarks covering adjuvant Matrix-M, we agreed to pay Novavax tranched royalties in the low single-digits on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees of vaccine products comprising our antigens and Matrix-M. In addition, we are required to pay Novavax specified milestone payments for development and commercialization of the first vaccine in each unique disease field. We do not expect to make milestone payments in 2016 under this agreement. If we sublicense Novavax patent rights, we will owe Novavax a percentage of the initial signing or upfront sublicensing fees we receive.\nWe also have a second T cell-stimulating vaccine candidate, GEN-004, a potential universal Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, vaccine to protect against the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. GEN-004 is designed to stimulate T helper 17 (\"Th17\") cells, a rare cell type that provides immunity at epithelial and mucosal surfaces, in the nasopharynx to prevent colonization by pneumococcus.\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase as we continue the manufacture of pre-clinical and clinical materials and manage the clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, GEN-003.\n \u2022 the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights, including milestone and royalty payments and patent prosecution fees that we are obligated to pay pursuant to our license agreements; \nG&A expense increased $4.7 million to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to additional personnel costs in 2014 of $2.0 million, including $1.0 million in increased stock-based compensation due to the vesting of certain performance-based common stock options; $1.1 million in increased audit, legal and consulting expenses; and $0.7 million in public company overhead costs.\nInterest expense, net\nFinancing and business operations\nIn May 2015, we announced positive top-line data from the Phase 2 trial. Subjects were randomized to one of six dosing groups of either 30\u03bcg or 60\u03bcg per protein paired with one of three Matrix-M2TM adjuvant doses (25\u03bcg, 50\u03bcg, or 75\u03bcg). A seventh group received placebo. Subjects received three doses of GEN-003 or placebo at 21-day intervals. Baseline viral shedding and genital lesion rates were established for each subject in a 28-day observation period prior to the commencement of dosing by collecting 56 genital swab samples (two per day), which were analyzed for the presence of HSV-2 DNA, and by recording the days on which genital lesions were present. During the 28-day observation period immediately after completion of dosing, the best dose of 60\u03bcg per protein/75\u03bcg of adjuvant demonstrated a highly statistically significant (p<0.0001) 55% reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rate, the primary endpoint of the trial and a measure of anti-viral activity. All dose combinations tested, including the successful 30\u03bcg per protein/50\u03bcg of adjuvant dose from the prior Phase 1/2a trial, demonstrated a statistically significant viral shedding rate reduction versus baseline and only the lowest dose combination did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction versus placebo. In a planned secondary analysis to assess impact on patient reported genital lesion rates, all dose groups, including the placebo group, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline. Furthermore, there was no difference in discontinuations in patient dosing due to AEs across the different treatment arms.\nOperating Activities\nLicense Agreement with Children's Medical Center Corporation. Under our license agreement with Children's Medical Center Corporation (\"Children's\"), in respect of Children's rights in jointly-owned patent rights covering certain Streptococcus antigens, we agreed to pay Children's low single digit royalties on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees of vaccine products comprising such Streptococcus antigens. In addition, we are required to pay Children's specified milestone payments for development and commercialization of such vaccines. We do not expect to make milestone payments in 2016 under this agreement. If we sublicense the jointly-owned patent rights, we will owe Children's a percentage of sublicensing revenue, excluding payments we receive based on the level of sales or profits.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities at December 31, 2015 are sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2017. Through this timeframe, we expect to have results from multiple Phase 2 GEN-003 studies, including the twelve-month data from our ongoing dose optimization clinical trial, data from a Phase 2b study designed to confirm the efficacy of GEN-003 manufactured at commercial scale, and data from a study to investigate the potential benefits of using GEN-003 in combination with oral antiviral medicines. In the second half of 2016, we also expect to have conducted our FDA end of Phase 2 meeting for GEN-003 for genital herpes to enable the initiation of a Phase 3 program in the second half of 2017. We have suspended the development of GEN-004 from our near-term plans and will focus our resources on the ongoing Phase 2 program for GEN-003 and on maximizing the potential of our preclinical pipeline and our ATLAS technology for T cell target discovery. We expect that these funds will not be sufficient to enable us to seek marketing approval or commercialize any of our product candidates.\n(2)Includes costs related to other product candidates and certain technology platform development costs related to ATLAS.\n \u2022 facility costs, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies. \nThe following table identifies research and development expenses on a program-specific basis for our product candidates (in thousands):\nIn the second half of 2016, we intend to commence a Phase 2b study to investigate the potential benefits of using GEN-003 in combination with oral antiviral medicines. We also intend to conduct an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in late 2016. We retain all rights to GEN-003 and plan to advance this program through regulatory approval and, if approved, commercialize this vaccine through a focused commercial effort in the United States. Outside the United States, we intend to evaluate partnerships for GEN-003 opportunistically.\nThe 2014 Term Loan had an original maturity of July 1, 2018. The eligibility requirements for the second tranche also contained an election for us to extend the maturity date to January 1, 2019. During the second quarter of 2015, we elected to extend the maturity date of the 2014 Term Loan. The maturity date of January 1, 2019 remained unchanged by the First Amendment.\nOther expense consists of fair value adjustments on warrants to purchase preferred stock. Upon completion of our IPO on February 10, 2014, warrants to purchase preferred stock were converted to warrants to purchase common stock and as a\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to advance our preclinical and clinical candidates, which include:\nIn June 2014, we announced top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial for GEN-004. This trial met its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity goals including measurable increases in the blood of Th17 cells. We initiated a 98-subject\nIn October 2015, we announced positive results from a planned interim analysis of data collected six months after dosing. At its best performing dose of 60\u00b5g per protein / 75\u00b5g of adjuvant, GEN-003 demonstrated a statistically significant 58% reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rate (p < 0.0001). In a planned secondary analysis, the proportion of patients receiving GEN-003 who were lesion-free at six months after dosing ranged from approximately 30% to 50%, similar to results reported in clinical trials with oral antiviral therapies. In addition, the time to first recurrence after completion of dosing showed a range of 152 days to greater than 180 days among dose groups. In a further secondary analysis measuring the impact on genital lesion rates, GEN-003 demonstrated sustained and statistically significant reductions from baseline in five of six dose groups ranging from 43% to 69%. The Phase 2 trial continues to show that GEN-003 is safe and well tolerated by patients, with no serious adverse events related to the vaccine. Data from the 12-month observation period in this trial is expected later in the first quarter of 2016.\nOther expense, net\nWe have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties\nOperating Capital Requirements\nGrant revenue\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nIn April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted in the United States. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth public companies.\nOn November 20, 2014 (the \"Closing Date\"), we entered into a loan and security agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d) with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d) which provided up to $27.0 million in debt financing in three separate tranches ( 2014 Term Loan\u201d). The first tranche of $17.0 million was available through June 30, 2015, of which $12.0 million was drawn down at loan inception for which approximately $9.8 million of the proceeds were used to repay the previously existing $10.0 million loan agreement (the \"2013 Term Loan\"). We recorded a $435 thousand loss on extinguishment of debt in other expense on the Statements of Operations related to deferred debt charges, the unamortized portion of the original issue discount related to the 2013 Term Loan and other fees associated with extinguishing the debt. The option to draw down the remaining $5.0 million under the first tranche expired unused on June 30, 2015. The second tranche of $5.0 million was subject to certain eligibility requirements which were achieved as of June 30, 2015 and we had the option to draw down the second tranche on or prior to December 15, 2015. The second tranche expired unused on December 15, 2015 The third tranche of $5.0 million was not eligible to draw as we did not achieve positive results from its Phase 2a human challenge study of GEN-004.\nIn November 2015, we also announced a collaboration with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to screen the T cell responses of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with CPIs against the complete repertoire of patient-specific putative cancer neoantigens. The goals of the collaboration are to identify signatures of T cell response in cancer patients associated with response or non-response to CPI therapy and to discover new T cell cancer vaccine antigens. ATLAS will be used in conjunction with Memorial Sloan Kettering's patient-specific cancer neoantigen sequences and blood samples from the same cancer patients.\n_________________________\nFollowing the closing of our IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Prior to the closing of our IPO, we utilized significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of our common stock for periods. We granted stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock as determined by the board of directors, with input from management. The board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock based on a number of objective and subjective factors, including external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector and the prices at which we sold shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock, the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to our common stock at the time and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or sale of our company.\nWe also have obligations to make future payments to third party licensors that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet or in the table above because the achievement and timing of these milestones is not fixed or determinable. These additional contractual commitments include the following:\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $28.2 million to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due largely to the purchase of marketable securities of $27.1 million and an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.1 million.\nIn March 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6.3 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.25 per share for an aggregate offering price of $51.7 million. In August 2015, we completed another underwritten public offering of 3.9 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $50.1 million. We received net proceeds from these offerings of approximately $95.7 million, after deducting approximately $6.1 million in underwriting discounts and commissions, excluding offering costs payable by us.\nassociated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nGrant revenue decreased $0.4 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was due to the completion of a grant to fund research for our pneumococcus program during 2013. In September 2014, we received $1.2 million from a grant entered into with the Gates Foundation. We recognized $0.3 million in revenue under the agreement in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nResearch and development expenses\nOther expense decreased $1.2 million to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to a non-recurring adjustment recorded in the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 to the fair value of warrants to purchase preferred stock as a result of an increase in the fair value of the underlying stock both before and on the date of the completion of our IPO on February 10, 2014. Additionally, in the fourth quarter end December 31, 2014, we incurred a $0.4 million loss on our debt extinguishment of a term note.\nresult, the Company no longer recorded fair value adjustments for its warrants. Other expense also consists of loss on debt extinguishment.\nDebt Financings\nFinancing Activities\nWe have no products approved for sale. We will not receive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products or until we potentially enter into agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of product candidates. If our development efforts for any of our product candidates result in regulatory approval or we enter into collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue from product sales or from such third parties.\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $43.0 million to $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due largely to the net proceeds from our IPO in 2014 of $60.0 million, net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $11.8 million, net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $2.0 million, an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of $0.6 million, and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") of $0.1 million, which was partially offset by the issuance of preferred stock of $15.3 million in 2013, the issuance of long-term debt of $10.0 million in 2013, and an increase in repayments of long-term debt of $6.2 million, which was due to the debt refinancing in November 2014.\n\nWe have one product candidate in active Phase 2 clinical development, GEN-003, an immunotherapy for the treatment of genital herpes. We have another product candidate, GEN-004, a universal vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal infections, for which we have suspended development pending further data analysis and consultation with our advisers after we did not achieve statistically significant results in our Phase 2a human challenge study. We also have active research and pre-clinical development programs for diseases including genital herpes, chlamydia and malaria. We are also investigating the application of ATLAS to immuno-oncology target discovery.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support the continued research and development of our product candidates and to operate as a public company. These increases will likely include higher costs for insurance, hiring activities, and professional services, such as outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of our first product candidate appears likely, we anticipate that we will increase our salary and personnel costs and other expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations.\nGrant revenue increased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.7 million from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to a full year of activities performed related to a $1.2 million grant entered into with the Gates Foundation in September 2014.\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses increased approximately $4.3 million to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $23.7 million for the same period ended December 31, 2014. This net increase was attributable to increases of $2.1 million in R&D personnel costs, approximately $1.8 million in lab-related and facilities costs and other general increases to support research activities offset by a $1.0 million decrease in clinical costs and licensing payments. R&D headcount has increased by more than 55% to support the clinical and manufacturing activities related to our Phase 2 trials, along with hiring to support our oncology and other research programs. The decline in both clinical costs and licensing payments related to the relative timing of major clinical activities and milestones in 2015 versus 2014.\nWe initiated a research collaboration with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (\"DFCI\") in 2014 to apply the ATLAS platform in immuno-oncology. This collaboration centered on ATLAS's potential to identify patterns of T cell response in cancer patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor (\"CPI\") therapy. By analyzing the immune responses of both responders and non-responders to CPI therapy, ATLAS successfully identified the cancer antigens to which either (or both) CD4+ or CD8+ T cells became activated. While this research was not powered to draw firm conclusions, the analysis of T cell responses in patients receiving CPI therapy revealed a pattern indicating a greater breadth of T cell activation for responders than non-responders. The study also revealed preliminary evidence that different characteristics of T cell responses emerge when comparing patients who respond and those who do not. Some T cell responses did not correspond with improved patient outcomes, and may be classified as decoys,\u201d further validating the ability of ATLAS to distinguish clinically relevant targets of T cell response. The collaboration with DFCI is ongoing as we continue to analyze more tumor samples to characterize T cell response profiles that may be prognostic of CPI efficacy, and to identify T cell antigens that may be included in novel immunotherapies.\n(1)Includes direct and indirect internal costs and external costs such as CMO and CRO costs.\nfinanced our operations through the issuance of our equity securities, debt financings and amounts received through grants. As of December 31, 2015, we had received an aggregate of $278.8 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and gross proceeds from debt facilities and an aggregate of $7.9 million from grants. At December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investments were $106.4 million.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had United States federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $143.8 million and $128.5 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2035. At December 31, 2015, we had federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards of approximately $3.7 million and $2.4 million available, respectively, to reduce future tax liabilities which expire at various dates through 2035. Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities and may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of our company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. At December 31, 2015, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our net operating loss and R&D tax credit carryforwards, as we believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be fully realized. In the future, if we determine that a portion or all of the tax benefits associated with our tax carryforwards will be realized, net income would increase in the period of determination.\nSince our inception through December 31, 2015, we have received an aggregate of $278.8 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and gross proceeds from debt facilities and an aggregate of $7.9 million from grants. At December 31, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and investments were $106.4 million, comprised of $17.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $89.2 million of investments.\n\n\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2015 are sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2017. Through this timeframe, we expect to have results from multiple Phase 2 GEN-003 studies including the twelve-month data from our ongoing dose optimization clinical trial, a Phase 2b study to test the efficacy of GEN-003 following changes in the manufacturing process to allow for production at commercial scale and a study to investigate the potential benefits of using GEN-003 in combination with oral antiviral medicines. In late 2016, we also expect to have conducted our FDA end of Phase 2 meeting for GEN-003 and we expect to commence Phase 3 studies in the second half of 2017. However, costs related to clinical trials can be unpredictable and therefore there can be no guarantee that our current balances of cash, cash equivalents and investments, and any proceeds received from other sources, will be sufficient to fund our studies or operations through this period. These funds will not be sufficient to enable us to conduct pivotal clinical trials for, seek marketing approval for or commercially launch GEN-003 or any other product candidate. Accordingly, to obtain marketing approval for and to commercialize these or any other product candidates, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital when needed would have a negative effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nContractual Obligations\nGrant revenue\nWe base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services performed pursuant to contracts with clinical sites that conduct clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of required data submission. In recording service fees, we make estimates based upon the time period over which services will be performed or other observable and measureable progress points as defined in the contracts, such as number of subjects enrolled, number of sites, or quantity of services performed in each period. The calculated amount of service fee expense is compared to the actual payments made pursuant to the contract's billing schedule to determine the resulting prepaid or accrual position. Additionally, for each clinical site, we accrue 10% of the earned amounts which is payable upon completion of the required data submission for the clinical trial. If our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there has been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nGEN-004 - Universal vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal infections\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $4.2 million to $14.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from $9.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due largely to additional personnel costs of $2.3 million attributable to higher headcount, increases in depreciation costs of approximately $0.4 million due to capital additions and expansion of our offices, and a $0.4 million increase in consulting and professional services mainly due to the recruitment and hiring activities that occurred during 2015. The remaining $1.1 million increase is generally attributable to higher public company overhead costs.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which include, but are not limited to, estimates related to clinical trial accruals, prepaid and accrued research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, common stock warrants, warrants to purchase redeemable securities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates or assumptions.\n \u2022 the terms and timing of any future collaborations, grants, licensing, consulting or other arrangements that we may establish; \nStock-based compensation expense includes options granted to employees and non-employees and has been reported in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as follows (in thousands):\nOther expense, net\nWe estimated the fair value of stock options of each employee stock award at the grant date using assumptions regarding the fair value of the underlying common stock on each grant date and the following additional assumptions:\n \u2022 costs of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials and lab supplies; and \nThe 2014 Term Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part upon seven business days' prior written notice to Hercules. Prepayments will be subject to a charge of 3.0% if an advance is prepaid within 12 months following the Closing Date, 2.0%, if an advance is prepaid between 12 and 24 months following the Closing Date, and 1.0% thereafter. Amounts outstanding at the time of an event of default shall be payable on demand and shall accrue interest at an additional rate of 5.0% per annum on any outstanding amounts past due. We also are obligated to pay Hercules an end of term charge of 4.95% of the balance drawn when the advances are repaid.\nIn December 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement (the \"First Amendment\") with Hercules. The First Amendment required us to draw an additional $5.0 million and permits us to draw two additional $5.0 million tranches. One $5.0 million tranche is immediately available to draw through December 15, 2016 and a second $5.0 million tranche becomes available through December 15, 2016, subject to us demonstrating sufficient evidence of continued clinical progression of our GEN-003 product and making favorable progress in applying our proprietary technology platform toward the development of novel immunotherapies with application in oncology. At December 31, 2015, $17.0 million was outstanding under the amended 2014 Term Loan.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $36.5 million to $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due largely to $35.2 million in higher net proceeds from two follow-on public offerings in 2015 compared to the proceeds from IPO in 2014, $3.4 million of additional borrowing proceeds primarily related to the First Amendment, both offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in proceeds from other common stock issuances that occurred in 2014.\nGEN-003 and GEN-004 Phase 2 clinical studies; an increase of $2.8 million in GEN-003 external costs, reflecting increased manufacturing costs and clinical trial costs; and an increase of $2.4 million in GEN-004 external costs, reflecting manufacturing costs and clinical trial costs.\nInterest expense, net\nFinancial Overview\nResearch and non-clinical development in oncology\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on our long-term debt facilities and non-cash interest related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by interest earned on our cash, cash equivalent and investment portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $8.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of related forfeiture estimates, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately three years. Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options has increased primarily based upon headcount growth and the related number of stock option awards granted to new and existing employees.\nOverview\n \u2022 the costs of commercialization activities for GEN-003 and other product candidates if we receive marketing approval, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; \nCash Flows\nStock-Based Compensation\nJOBS Act\nResults of Operations\nInvesting Activities\nGrant revenue consists of revenue earned to conduct vaccine development research. We have received grants from private not-for-profit organizations and federal agencies. These grants have related to the discovery and development of several of our product candidates, including product candidates for the prevention of pneumococcus, chlamydia, and malaria. Revenue under these grants is recognized as research services are performed. Funds received in advance of research services being performed are recorded as deferred revenue. We plan to continue to pursue grant funding, but there can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining such grants in the future.\nGrant revenue\nWe have ongoing non-clinical development programs in chlamydia and genital herpes prophylaxis and a research program funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (\"Gates Foundation\") in malaria.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn connection with the 2014 Term Loan, we issued a common stock warrant to Hercules on November 20, 2014. The warrant is exercisable for 73,725 shares of our common stock (equal to $607,500 divided by the exercise price of $8.24).\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in operations increased $10.8 million to $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due primarily to increases in (i) the net loss of approximately $7.2 million, (ii) accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.0 million, and (iii) stock based compensation of $0.9 million, offset by decreases in deferred revenue of $1.6 million and fair value of warrant liability of $0.7 million, along with other changes in our working capital accounts.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nInterest expense, net\n\nIn October 2015, we announced that top-line results from the Phase 2a clinical trial for GEN-004 showed consistent reductions versus placebo in the pre-specified endpoints of the rate and density of colonization, but that neither of the endpoints achieved statistical significance. GEN-004 was safe and well tolerated by subjects. GEN-004 reduced the colonization rate, measured by microbiological culture, by between 22% and 25% versus placebo across those measurement time points. When measured by the presence of pneumococcal DNA, the reductions ranged between 18% and 36%. Additionally the median density of colonization measured by microbiological culture for GEN-004 treated subjects ranged from zero to two colony forming units (\"CFUs\") per mL of nasal wash compared to one to 11 CFUs per mL for the placebo group. When measured by the presence of pneumococcal DNA, the median densities ranged from zero to 10 copies per mL in treated subjects and 19 to 52 copies per mL in placebo subjects. None of the differences were statistically significant. There was no difference in the duration of colonization between GEN-004 and placebo.\nHaving identified a dose that, according to company-sponsored market research, delivers clinically meaningful efficacy in magnitude and durability, we are now conducting a 310-subject Phase 2 dose optimization trial. The objective of this trial is to confirm the results of the best performing dose in the Phase 1/2a trial and to test six other combinations of proteins and adjuvant to determine the optimal dose for future trials and potentially improve on the current profile of GEN-003.\nIn March 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6.3 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.25 per share for an aggregate offering price of $51.7 million. In August 2015, we completed another underwritten public offering of 3.9 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $50.1 million. We received net proceeds from these offerings of approximately $95.7 million, after deducting approximately $6.1 million in underwriting discounts and commissions, excluding offering costs payable by us.\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our prepaid and accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed for us and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our prepaid and accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated prepaid and accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to CROs in connection with clinical trials, CMOs with respect to pre-clinical and clinical materials and intermediaries and vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.\nATLAS technology platform. These increases were offset by a $1.5 million cost decrease in GEN-004 due to our fourth quarter decision to suspend investment in this program.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section entitled Selected Financial Data\u201d and our financial statements and related notes appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and \nOther expense, net\n \u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire other products and technologies. \n\nResearch and non-clinical development in infectious disease\nWe also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for preclinical safety and research studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and do not include any minimum purchase commitments, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table above.\nIn November 2015, we commenced a new program focused on Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV\u201d). EBV infection has been linked to cancers with high unmet needs such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. We believe the ATLAS platform is highly suited to the creation of a new immunotherapy for EBV given that T cell responses are understood to be crucial for protection against EBV. Furthermore, EBV is part of the herpesvirus family, in which we have years of experience through our development of GEN-003.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe expense internal research and development costs to operations as incurred. We expense third party costs for research and development activities, such as conducting clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific performance or tasks such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information, which is provided to us by our vendors.\nOther expenses increased $0.8 million to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due to an increase in the fair value of warrants to purchase preferred stock as a result of an increase in the fair value of the underlying stock both before and on the date of the completion of our IPO on February 10, 2014. Additionally, an increase of $0.2 million related to the loss on debt extinguishment of a term note.\n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (\"CROs\"), contract manufacturing organizations (\"CMOs\"), consultants and other vendors that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical activities; \nResearch and development expenses\nPrepaid and Accrued Research and Development Expenses\nIn February 2014, we completed an IPO of 5.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $12.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $66.0 million. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $61.4 million, after deducting approximately $4.6 million in underwriting discounts and commission, excluding offering costs payable by us.\nWe commenced business operations in August 2006. To date, our operations have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring and developing our proprietary ATLAS technology, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates. All of our revenue to date has been grant revenue. We have not generated any product revenue and do not expect to do so for the foreseeable future. We have primarily\n \u2022 the receipt of marketing approval, revenue received from commercial sales of our product candidates; \nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n \u2022 the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; \nPhase 2a trial in September 2014 to demonstrate that GEN-004 can reduce the frequency, magnitude and duration of colonization of pneumococcus in the nasopharynx in healthy adults.\nWe expect that we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to commercialize GEN-003 and our other product candidates in order to receive regulatory approval. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be materially diluted and the terms of these securities could include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of GEN-003 or our other product candidates, seek collaborators at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available, and relinquish or license, potentially on unfavorable terms, our rights to GEN-003 or our other product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nWe have applied the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\"), Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718\"), to account for stock-based compensation for employees and ASC 718 and FASB ASC Topic 505, Equity (\"ASC 505\"), for non-employees. We recognize\nLicense Agreement with The Regents of the University of California. Under our license agreement with The Regents of the University of California (\"UC\"), in respect of UC patent rights covering aspects of our ATLAS discovery platform, we agreed to pay UC low single digit royalties on net sales by us of vaccine products comprising antigens identified through use of the ATLAS discovery platform covered by licensed UC patent rights. If we sublicense UC patent rights, we will owe UC a percentage of sublicensing revenue, including any royalty paid to us on net sales by sublicensees.\nAlthough we did not achieve statistical significance in this study, the consistent apparent effect supports the vaccine concept and in the potential for GEN-004. We believe it is possible that future trials would require a change in some combination of dose, adjuvant or trial population to confirm any effect. Pending ongoing data analysis and consultation with our advisors to determine next steps for this program, we have suspended the development of GEN-004 from our near-term plans and will focus our resources on the ongoing GEN-003 program, and on maximizing the potential of our preclinical pipeline and our ATLAS technology for T cell target discovery.\nGEN-003 - Phase 2 immunotherapy for genital herpes\nIf GEN-003 successfully completes clinical development and is approved, we believe it would represent an important new treatment option for patients with genital herpes.\n \u2022 the timing and costs of our ongoing and planned clinical trials for GEN-003; \nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\n\nUnder ASC 718, we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from its estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the differences are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.\nResearch and development expenses\nOverview\nOur primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be for the near future, compensation and related expenses, manufacturing costs for pre-clinical and clinical materials, third party clinical trial R&D services, laboratory and related supplies, clinical costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.\nNet cash used in operations increased $7.7 million to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due primarily to an increase in the net loss of approximately $14.5 million, partially offset by an increase of $0.2 million on loss on debt extinguishment, an increase in stock based compensation of $2.2 million, an increase in change in fair value of warrant liability of $0.5 million, an increase in non-cash interest expense of $0.2 million, an increase in depreciation expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $3.4 million in our working capital accounts.\nWe expect that our revenue will be less than our expenses for the foreseeable future and that we will experience increasing losses as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. Our ability to generate revenue for each product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval will depend on numerous factors, including competition, commercial manufacturing capability and market acceptance of our products.\nOur lead program is GEN-003, a Phase 2 candidate therapeutic vaccine, or immunotherapy, that we are developing to treat genital herpes infections. Data from our double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating Phase 1/2a trial for GEN-003 represented the first reported instance of a therapeutic vaccine working against an infectious disease, and we have identified a dose in our Phase 2 trial which has showed an even greater reduction in viral shedding than the best dose in the Phase 1/2a trial.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nOn a program basis, GEN-003 costs increased by $0.4 million largely due to (i) the ongoing Phase 2 dose optimization that began in the second half of 2014 (ii) costs incurred to drive improvements in the manufacturing process for GEN-003 to enable production at commercial scale, and (iii) costs related to the initiation of patient screening for a 135-subject Phase 2b study in the fourth quarter of 2015. Pre-clinical R&D increased by $5.4 million as we accelerated our investment in immuno-oncology research and collaborations and increased spending on our other product candidates and the development of the\nR&D expense increased $8.0 million to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was attributable to: an increase of $2.4 million in R&D personnel costs, including $1.2 million in stock-based compensation; an increase of $0.4 million in licensing milestones related to the start of\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $42.5 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our accumulated deficit was $157.9 million as of December 31, 2015. We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the amendment negotiations, but after the third quarter Form 10-Q was filed, we identified three separate covenant violations that resulted in an event of default as of September 30, 2015. The violated covenants related to certain investments the Company held as well as certain financial reporting obligations. Pursuant to the 2014 Term Loan, upon an event of default, Hercules can accelerate the repayment of all amounts due under the 2014 Term Loan at their discretion. Hercules did not make a repayment demand and the First Amendment included a permanent waiver of these covenant violations subject only to certain requirements that are within our control. The First Amendment also modified the Loan Agreement for the specific instances in which these violations arose, including redefining permitted investments to be in line with our approved investment policies.\nIn October 2014, we entered a product development and clinical supply agreement with Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions LLC (\"Baxter\"). The product development and clinical supply agreement provides the terms and conditions under which Baxter will formulate, fill, inspect, package, label and test our lead product, GEN-003 for clinical supply. We are obligated to pay Baxter for each batch of GEN-003 manufactured. Additionally, certain set-up fees and equipment purchased for the purposes of batch production will be invoiced separately by Baxter. We are also responsible for the payment of a monthly service fee for project management services for the duration of the arrangement. There are no minimum purchase obligations and we may cancel the agreement at any point subject to payment for services rendered through the date of cancellation. The Company has incurred expenses of $702 thousand under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 the progress, timing and costs of manufacturing GEN-003 for current and planned clinical trials; \n \u2022 personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and travel; \nCertain classes of our preferred stock were redeemable beginning in 2017 at the original issuance price plus any declared or accrued but unpaid dividends upon written election of the preferred stockholders in accordance with the terms of our articles of incorporation. Accretion of preferred stock reflects the accretion of issuance costs and, for Series B preferred stock, cumulative dividends based on their respective redemption values. On February 10, 2014, we completed our IPO and all shares of preferred stock were converted into 11,466,479 shares of our Common Stock. No accretion of preferred stock is recorded after this date as no shares of preferred stock are outstanding.\n_________________________\nDetermining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock-based awards as of their measurement date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the award. Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the fair value of our common stock on the measurement date, the expected term of our stock options, the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Because of our limited operating history as a publicly traded entity, we utilize data from a representative group of publicly traded companies to estimate expected stock price volatility. We selected representative companies from the biopharmaceutical industry with characteristics similar to us. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment as we do not have sufficient historical stock option activity data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. For non-employee grants, we use an expected term equal to the remaining contractual term of the award. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention of paying cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life.\nFor periods prior to the closing of our IPO, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock considering, in part, the work of an independent third-party valuation specialist. The board determined the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates considering valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, also known as the Practice Aid. We engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to perform contemporaneous valuations as of December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013, July 25, 2013, August 12, 2013 and October 21, 2013 and a retrospective valuation as of March 6, 2013. In conducting the valuations, the independent third-party valuation specialist considered all objective and subjective factors that it believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted in accordance with the Practice Aid, including our best estimate of our business condition, prospects and operating performance at each valuation date. Significant changes to the key assumptions used in the valuations could have resulted in different fair values of common stock at each valuation date.\n\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nFollowing improvements that we have made to the manufacturing process for GEN-003 to enable production at commercial scale, we initiated patient screening in the fourth quarter of 2015 and commenced the dosing phase in January 2016 for a 135-subject Phase 2b study to confirm the efficacy of this new material. Subjects will be randomized to one of two dose levels of GEN-003 or a placebo. We expect to announce top-line viral shedding rate data from the 28-day observation period immediately after dosing from this study in the middle of 2016. The study will also compare GEN-003 efficacy to placebo for the clinical endpoints of: the proportion of patients who are lesion free at six and 12 months after dosing; the time to first lesion recurrence after dosing; and, the impact on percentage of days with genital herpes lesions at six and 12 months after dosing. Data from these six and 12 month clinical endpoints is expected in the second half of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. All subjects will be followed for 12 months after the last dose.\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses, in executive and other administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees associated with corporate and intellectual property legal expenses, consulting and accounting services.\n \u2022 the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates and potential product candidates; \nInterest expense, net increased $0.1 million to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $1.0 million for the same period ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due primarily to higher average principal balances on our outstanding debt for the year to date period in 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 offset by higher levels of interest income on our investment portfolio.\nFinal analysis of the data from the Phase 1/2a trial showed that, for the best performing 30\u00b5g dose group, there was a sustained reduction in the viral shedding rate. After completion of dosing for this group, the viral shedding rate fell by 52% versus baseline and, at six months after the final dose, the shedding rate remained at 40% below baseline. The reduction in the genital lesion rate after completion of the third dose was greatest for the 30\u00b5g dose group at 48%. After six months, the reduction from baseline in genital lesion rate for this dose group was 65% and, after 12 months, the genital lesion rate was 42% lower than baseline. GEN-003 was safe and well tolerated over the 12 months of this trial.\ncompensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Stock compensation related to non-employee awards is re-measured at each reporting period until the awards are vested.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nEach advance accrues interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.25% or (ii) the sum of 7.25% plus the prime rate minus 5.0%. The 2014 Term Loan provided for interest-only payments until December 31, 2015, which was extended by us for a six-month period as the eligibility requirements for the second tranche were met during the second quarter of 2015. The First Amendment subsequently extended the interest only period through June 30, 2017. Thereafter, beginning July 1, 2017, principal and interest payments will be made monthly for 18 months with a payoff schedule based upon a 30-month amortization schedule, the original amortization term of the 2014 Term Loan. The remaining unpaid principal is due at January 1, 2019.\nLicense Agreement with Harvard. Under our license agreement with President and Fellows of Harvard College (\"Harvard\"), in respect of Harvard patent rights covering certain chlamydia antigens, we agreed to pay Harvard royalties in the high single-digits on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees of vaccine products comprising such chlamydia antigens. In addition, we are required to pay Harvard specified milestone payments for development of the first such chlamydia vaccine. Under the same license agreement, in respect of patent rights covering aspects of our antigen discovery platform, we agreed to pay Harvard royalties in the low single-digits on worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees, for a period of 10 years from first commercial sale, of vaccine products comprising antigens (other than chlamydia antigens above) identified through use of the antigen discovery platform covered by licensed Harvard patent rights. In addition, we are required to pay Harvard specified milestone payments for development of such vaccines. We do not expect to make milestone payments in 2016 under this agreement. If we sublicense Harvard patent rights, we will owe Harvard a percentage of sublicensing revenue, excluding payments we receive based on the level of sales or profits. We notified Harvard of our partial termination of the license agreement with regard to the chlamydia antigens on December 8, 2014. Effective March 8, 2015, the license agreement with Harvard with regard to the chlamydia antigens was terminated and we no longer hold a license to two of the three in-licensed Harvard patent families, or to a chlamydia antigen covered by the remaining family. The remaining family covers certain aspects of the ATLAS platform, as well as one chlamydia antigen, and we continue to maintain exclusive rights to aspects of the ATLAS platform covered by this family.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $36.4 million to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due largely to a net $35.1 million increase in investments and an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of $1.3 million.\nInterest expense, net increased $0.5 million to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due primarily to higher average principal balances related to our term loan in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nOperating Activities\n (1) As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of $17.0 million in long-term debt due consisting of amounts due under the 2014 Term Loan. We are obligated to pay an end of term charge of 4.95% of the balance drawn when the principal balance is repaid. We have included $0.8 million in this table for the end of term charge based upon the debt outstanding at December 31, 2015.  In February 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc. (\"Fujifilm\") for the manufacture and supply of certain antigens for its GEN-003 clinical program. Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay Fujifilm manufacturing milestones, in addition to reimbursement of certain production related costs, as production occurs. Additionally, the agreement required the payment of a reservation fee, which will equal a percentage of the expected production fees, to reserve manufacturing slots in the production timeframe. There are no minimum purchase obligations and we may cancel the agreement at any point subject to certain cancellation charges that may be applicable based upon the cancellation date and the start of production along with the payment for services rendered through the date of cancellation. The Company has incurred expenses of $4.1 million under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2015.", "item_7_tables": "Table 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Genocea is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel vaccines and immunotherapies using its ATLAS discovery platform technology. Lead product candidate is GEN-003 for genital herpes. Also had GEN-004 for pneumococcal infections but development is now suspended.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n- Have incurred significant operating losses since inception, with net losses of $42.5 million in 2015 and $35.3 million in 2014. Expect continued losses as products are still in development.\n- R&D expenses were $28 million in 2015, increased from $23.7 million in 2014 due to increased spending on pipeline programs. G&A expenses grew to $14 million in 2015.  \n- Completed public offerings in 2015 raising $95.7 million in net proceeds. Cash balance was $106.4 million at end of 2015.\n\nGEN-003 Program\n- Phase 2 dose optimization trial ongoing to confirm best dose. Additional Phase 2b trial initiated to confirm efficacy with commercial-scale manufacturing. Pursuing regulatory approval with expectation to start Phase 3 trials in 2017.\n\nGEN-004 Program\n- Phase 2a trial did not achieve statistical significance on endpoints. Development now suspended to focus resources on GEN-003 and earlier pipeline assets.\n\nFinances\n- Current cash projected to fund operations into second half of 2017. Will need additional funding to seek marketing approvals and commercialize any products."}
