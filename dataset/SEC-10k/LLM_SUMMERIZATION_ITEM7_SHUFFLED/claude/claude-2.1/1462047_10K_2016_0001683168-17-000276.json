Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. The discussion and analysis that follow should be read together with the section entitled Forward Looking Statements\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nExcept for historical information, the matters discussed in this section are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond the Company's control. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report.\nCurrency and exchange rate\nUnless otherwise noted, all currency figures quoted as U.S. dollars\u201d, dollars\u201d or $\u201d refer to the legal currency of the United States. References to MYR\u201d or RM\u201d are to the Malaysian Ringgit, the legal currency of Malaysia. Throughout this report, assets and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders' equity.\nOverview\nDuring the fiscal year 2016, we operated in two business segments: (i) our oil palm and durian plantation business; and (ii) our real estate business. Our oil palm and durian plantation business is operated through Virtual Setup Sdn. Bhd., or VSSB, and our real estate business is primarily operated through PGCG Assets Holdings Sdn. Bhd., or PGCG Assets, and Dunford Corporation Sdn Bhd.\nSummarized financial information regarding each revenue generating segment for the year ended October 31, 2016 is as follows:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended October 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Plantation Business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Real Estate Business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Corporate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,564,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,672,755 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less: inter-company revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,028 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,028 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues from external customers </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,538,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,646,727 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,585 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(594,833 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(630,418 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>943,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,016,309 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>528,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,290 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(525,696 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(388,116 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(911,522 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,957,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,523,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>331,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,811,852 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expenditure for long-lived assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,137 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur initial business plan launched in July 2010 broadly contemplated the development, distribution and operation of mobile and online social networking, ecommerce and search products and services. However, as a result of the challenges we experienced in implementing our m-commerce business plan, we entered the oil palm plantation and real estate businesses in 2012 and in 2014 discontinued our software business. Since the commencement of our business segments, we (through our subsidiaries):\nTable 58: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Acquired an oil palm plantation in Malaysia which is operated through VSSB; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Acquired 21.8921 hectares (54.10 acres) of vacant development land located in Selangor, Malaysia, which is subject to a 99-year leasehold, expiring July 30, 2100; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Acquired Dunford Corporation Sdn.

Management has limited experience operating in this industry and may not be able to successfully navigate all industry specific factors in addition to any geopolitical factors in Malaysia. If we are not able to successfully respond to any of these or other factors, our business operations and financial results may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully operate a multi-national oilseeds business in conjunction with our other business segments given management's limited experience.\nWe are focused on the maintenance and operation of our oil palm and durian plantation in Malaysia. We believe that the value of our oil palm and durian plantation has increased since its acquisition , and while we have not pursued any discussions or received any formal offers regarding the sale of our plantation, we may consider sales offers in the future if a sale would maximize return to our investors.\nWe commenced planting premium durian, of the Musang King\u201d variety, in the first quarter of calendar year 2014. As of the date of this report, we have replanted 130 acres of our oil palm with premium durian trees. In November 2016, we began planting an additional 150 acres of durian. We planted an average of 35 trees per acre and anticipate an average production of 50 grade A fruits per tree for each of the two harvesting seasons per year.\nWe have used the latest planting technology in 2016, which we hope will reduce the maturity time of the durian tree from 5 years to 3 years. All the durian trees planted on the 130 acres will begin to fruit by 2019 at the latest. Accordingly, we do not expect revenue from our durian orchard until calendar year 2019. At this time, we do not expect our durian orchard to exceed 280 acres in the near future.\nChallenges From Our Real Estate Operations\nCommercial Buildings\nWe generate rental income from our 12 story and 15 story commercial properties and anticipate generating income from the sale of developed properties. As of the date of this report, 2 of the 12 stories of our 12 story building have been leased to tenants at market rates. We are actively attempting to lease our 8 vacant units. We occupy the remaining two stories as our corporate headquarters.\nOur 15 story building is fully leased to Le Apple which operates a boutique hotel on the premises. The Rental Agreement has an initial term of one (1) year commencing December 1, 2013 and expiring November 30, 2014. Provided that there are no existing breaches by Le Apple, we will be required to renew the lease for additional one-year terms up to twenty-nine years, for a maximum aggregate term of thirty years. Our current monthly rental rate is RM400,000 (approximately $95,386), which rate is increased every three years by 5% to 10% or to the then prevailing market rate, whichever is lower. Our current rate represents a decrease from our initial monthly rental rate of RM550,000 due to unfavorable market conditions.\nResidential Property Development\nOn June 10, 2015, we received approval to develop our leasehold land located in Puncak Alam. Due to challenges in the current Malaysian real property market, in November 2015, we submitted a request to convert some our planned semi-detached and bungalow home parcels into cluster semi-detached homes to improve the marketability of the development. We received approval of our revised development plan on March 4, 2016.\nWe believe that we will require approximately RM5 to RM10 million in the aggregate to market, promote and complete construction of our Shah Alam 2 Eco Residential Development Project. To mitigate our development risk, on July 1, 2016, we entered into a MOU with YTB to jointly develop our Puncak Alam land. YTB is currently conducting its feasibility studies and business and market due diligence. In the event YTB elects not to proceed with the Proposed JV, we will reassess market conditions to determine whether we will seek additional development partners, proceed on other bases or suspend development efforts until market conditions improve. As of the approval date of this report, no definitive agreement has been concluded.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn September 8, 2016, the Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Ministry of Malaysia announced the introduction of an initiative that will enable property developers to provide loans to buyers at an annual interest rate between 12 and 18 percent. Developers will be able to begin applying to the ministry on September 8, 2016, for a moneylending license. It is our understanding that loans made pursuant to such license will not be restricted to first time homebuyers.\nWe are considering applying for such money lender's license to enable us to provide financing to prospective buyers of our future properties. If we apply and are successful in obtaining such license, we hope that we will be able to boost sales of our properties that we have earmarked for development.\nWe continue to maintain a cautious but positive outlook for the residential market based upon Malaysia's stable employment outlook, growth in household income, formation of new households, and increased demand for affordable residential property from first time home buyers. Developers such as us are facing challenges of inconsistent supply and high cost of labor, increased costs of building materials (such as cement and steel bars) and general increased costs of doing business. Our market is also sensitive to changes in lending rates and lending requirements as many homebuyers rely on financing to make purchases. As a result, government or bank policies that result in increased interest rates and or stricter lending requirements may adversely affect the sales of our developed properties.\nResults of Operations\nAs of October 31, 2016, we suffered from continuous operating loss from prior years and working capital deficit of $5,111,507. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders or other capital sources. Management believes that the continuing financial support from the existing shareholders and external financing will provide the additional cash to meet our obligations as they become due.\nThese consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.\nThe following table sets forth certain operational data for the years indicated:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended October 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,646,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,919,743 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Plantation business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156,642 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,538,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,763,101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total cost of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(630,418 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(739,867 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Plantation business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,585 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(83,728 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(594,833 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(656,139 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,016,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,179,876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Plantation business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,914 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>943,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,106,962 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(626,395 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,046,125 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income, net (expense) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,047,898 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,090,244 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(253,538 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(636,941 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(911,522 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,593,434 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015\nNet Revenue. We generated net revenue of $1,646,727 and $1,919,743 for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with our oil palm and durian plantation and real estate businesses accounting for 7% and 93% of the net revenue, respectively, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, our oil palm and durian plantation and real estate businesses accounted for approximately 8% and 92% of net revenue, respectively.\nOur oil palm and durian plantation business experienced a 31% decline with net revenue decreasing from $156,642 for the year ended October 31, 2015, to $108,516 for the same period ended October 31, 2016. Revenue from our plantation business decreased when we contracted out the management and operation of our oil palm plantation from September 2015 to September 2016, as well as utilizing 130 acres of the land for durian plantation.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur real estate business experienced a 13% decrease in revenue from $1,763,101 for the year ended October 31, 2015, to $1,538,211 for the same period ended October 31, 2016. The decrease in our real estate revenue is attributable to the decrease in rental income from both the twelve story and fifteen story buildings.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue was approximately 38%, or $630,418, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, with real estate and plantation sales accounting for approximately 39% and 33%, respectively, of the respective net revenue. Cost of revenue for the year ended October 31, 2015 was $739,867. Cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue for the year ended October 31, 2015 was approximately 39%, with real estate and plantation sales accounting for approximately 37% and 53%, respectively, of the respective net revenue.\nGross Profit. We achieved a gross profit of $1,016,309 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, as compared to $1,179,876 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, with real estate rental income and plantation sales accounting for approximately 93% and 7%, respectively of total gross profit. The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the change in our plantation business model and lower rental income on our commercial properties.\nOnce we begin real estate development, we expect gross profit derived from our real estate business to gradually increase as we commence sales activities with respect to our developed properties. We also expect our plantation revenue to increase once our premium durian orchard has matured and is able to produce grade A fruits for distribution. We expect the fruits to begin generating revenue sometime in 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses ( G&A\u201d). We incurred G&A expenses of $626,395 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, representing a decrease of 40%, as compared to $ 1,046,125 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. The decrease in G&A is primarily attributable to lower staff cost in fiscal 2016. Also, in fiscal 2015, we incurred consultancy fees on the development of the Puncak Alam project. No such costs were incurred in fiscal 2016.\nG&A as a percentage of net revenue was approximately 38% and 54% for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a general matter, we expect our G&A to increase in the foreseeable future as we acquire real estate or other businesses and assets.\nOther Income, net. We incurred net other expenses of $1,047,898 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, as compared to $1,090,244 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. The decrease is attributable primarily to a decrease in interest rate charged on our bank loans. Our net other expenses for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of interest expense on our bank loans. In fiscal 2016, we recorded an impairment of $135,597 on our investments, resulting from the other-than-temporary decline in their fair value.\nIncome Tax Expense. We recorded income tax expenses of $253,538 and $636,941 for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In fiscals 2016 and 2015, we recorded under-accrual of estimated Malaysian income tax of $9,692 and $271,568, respectively, for previous years. The Malaysian income tax in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was mainly related to the rental income being taxed as a non-business source pursuant to the Malaysian income tax rules.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of October 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $685,876, accounts receivable of $137,207 and incurred a net loss of $911,522 for fiscal 2016.\nAs of October 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $836,794, accounts receivable of $112,439 and incurred a net loss of $1,593,434 for fiscal 2015.\nOur ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.19:1 and 0.50:1 as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe expect to incur significantly greater expenses in the near future, including the contractual obligations that we discussed below, to begin development activities. We also expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our finance and administrative staff, add infrastructure, and incur additional costs related to being an accelerated filer, including directors' and officers' insurance and increased professional fees.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur PRC Subsidiary\nThe de-registration of our PRC subsidiary was approved by the PRC tax office in April 2015 and was approved by PRC State Administration of Industry and Commerce in August 2015.\nAs of October 31, 2016, the amount of net assets held by our PRC subsidiary was $0.\nAs of October 31, 2015, the amount of net assets held by our PRC subsidiary was $74,595, all of which cash is restricted.\nWe have never paid dividends on our Common Stock. Our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development, acquisitions or expansion; consequently, we do not expect to pay dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nGoing Concern Uncertainties\nOur continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and public offerings, capital leases and short-term and long-term debts. In fiscal 2015, we obtained new short-term bank borrowings of $4.0 million. In fiscal year 2014, we raised approximately $6.7 million from sales of the securities of our subsidiaries. While we believe that we will obtain external financing and the existing shareholders will continue to provide the additional cash to meet our obligations as they become due, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended October 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(162,076 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(518,504 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,685,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,718,598 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,691,179 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,517,508 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used In Operating Activities.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $162,076, which consisted primarily of a net loss (excluding non-cash depreciation and impairment on available-for-sale securities) of $247,004 and a decrease in accrued liabilities and other payables of $39,778.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $518,504, which consisted primarily of a net loss (excluding non-cash depreciation and bad debt written off) of $976,827 and a decrease in rental deposits from tenants of $118,894, offset by an increase in income tax payable of $296,773, an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $216,222, and an increase in accrued liabilities and other payables of $61,986.\nWe expect rental income from our real estate operations to stabilize once our two commercial properties are at or near full capacity. We expect to continue to rely on cash generated through financing from our existing shareholders and private placements of our securities, however, to finance our operations and future acquisitions.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was $1,685,549, which is primarily attributable to a decrease in time deposits of $1,731,975, offset by payments of plantation development costs of $37,289.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $2,718,598, which is primarily attributable to an increase in time deposits made by us of $1,902,417, purchase of the marketable securities of $465,606, payments of plantation development costs of $44,153, an increase in construction in progress of $301,354 and the purchase of plant, property and equipment of $17,291, offset by the sales proceeds received from disposal of plant and equipment of $12,223.\nWe expect investing cash outflows to increase when we develop our durian plantation until the orchard matures and begins to generate revenues in 2019 at the earliest. We also expect investing cash outflows to increase due to expenditures associated with developing our residential projects.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $1,691,179 consisting primarily of repayments of advances from Weng Kung Wong, our Chief Executive Officer and director, of $924,780 and repayments on bank loans of $764,215.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $2,517,508, consisting primarily of proceeds from new bank borrowings of $10,494,084 and revolving line of credit of $3,997,442, offset by the repayments of advances from Weng Kung Wong, our Chief Executive Officer and director, of $1,051,548, repayment on bank loans of $10,920,071 and payments on a finance lease of $2,399.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts.

We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management's current judgments. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements.\nTable 71: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Accounts receivable </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. We extend unsecured credit to our customers in the ordinary course of business but mitigates the associated risks by performing credit checks and actively pursuing past due accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established and determined based on managements' assessment of known requirements, aging of receivables, payment history, the customer's current credit worthiness and the economic environment. We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for any estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. For the receivables that are past due or not being paid according to payment terms, the appropriate actions are taken to exhaust all means of collection, including seeking legal resolution in a court of law. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nBased upon the aforementioned criteria, we wrote off $nil and $25,850 accounts receivable on uncollectible rental receivable for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Available-for-sale marketable securities </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities are reported at fair value using the market approach based on the quoted prices in active markets at the reporting date. We classify the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 1 of fair value measurements. Any unrealized losses that are deemed other-than-temporary are included in current period earnings and removed from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nRealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in current period earnings. For purposes of computing realized gains and losses, the cost basis of each investment sold is generally based on the weighted average cost method.\nWe regularly evaluate whether the decline in fair value of available-for-sale securities is other-than-temporary and objective evidence of impairment could include:\nTable 74: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The severity and duration of the fair value decline; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Evaluation of the factors that could cause individual securities to have an other-than-temporary impairment. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2016, $135,597 of losses previously classified in other comprehensive losses were reclassified into earnings to recognize an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. No such other-than-temporary decline in fair value was recognized during the year ended October 31, 2015.\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we invested in equity securities listed on Bursa Malaysia with a total cost of $265,606 and escrow funds (which invested in equity securities listed in the U.S.) with a total cost of $200,000. The Company entered into an escrow agreement with Peijin Wu Hoppe ( Hoppe\u201d), our former director, to set up an escrow fund up to $500,000 as a reserve to indemnify Hoppe from any claim of liability until July 29, 2022, the seventh year anniversary of the termination of Director Retainer Agreement, or any mutual agreement with Hoppe and us. The unrealized loss representing the change in fair value of $60,590 and $106,783 was charged against accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTable 77: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Deferred development costs </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred development costs consist of replanting costs of durian such as soil amendments, cultivation, fertilization and purchase costs of sapling. Costs related to durian development projects on our plantation land, are capitalized during the sapling, developing and planting durian fruit bunches and when the harvests are substantially available for commercial sale. Deferred development costs will then commence to be amortized as components of plantation costs and expenses.\nTable 78: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Property, plant and equipment </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

The gain or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the statement of operations.\nLong-lived assets primarily include freehold plantation land, leasehold land held for development, freehold land and land improvement for rental purpose and building structure and improvements. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\u201d, we generally conduct our annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the lowest level group. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset. There has been no impairment charge for the years presented.\nWe have separately identified the portion of freehold land and building structure, in which freehold land is not subject to amortization and buildings are to be amortized over 33 years on a straight-line method, based on applicable local laws and practice.\nPolicy for Capitalizing Development Cost\nThe cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to planning, developing, initial leasing and constructing a property are capitalized and classified as Real Estate in the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized development costs include interest, and other direct project costs incurred during the period of development. As of October 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no such capitalized interest.\nA variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. We adopt the capitalization policy on development properties, which is guided by ASC Topic 835-20 Interest - Capitalization of Interest\u201d and ASC Topic 970 Real Estate - General\u201d. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the receipt of certificates of occupancy, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.\nWe capitalize leasing costs which include commissions paid to outside brokers, legal costs incurred to negotiate and document a lease agreement and any internal costs that may be applicable. We allocate these costs to individual tenant leases and amortize them over the related lease term.\nTable 81: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Finance leases </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeases that transfer substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership to the lessee, other than legal title, are accounted for as finance leases. Substantially all of the risks or benefits of ownership are deemed to have been transferred if any one of the four criteria is met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease containing a bargain purchase option, (iii) the lease term exceeding 75% of the estimated economic life of the leased asset, (iv) the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeding 90% of the fair value. At the inception of a finance lease, we as the lessee records an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments. The leased asset is amortized over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life if title does not transfer to us, while the leased asset is depreciated in accordance with our depreciation policy if the title is to eventually transfer to us. The periodic rent payments made during the lease term are allocated between a reduction in the obligation and interest element using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 835-30, Imputation of Interest\u201d.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Revenue recognition </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize our revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition\u201d, upon the delivery of our plantation products when: (1) title and risk of loss are transferred; (2) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (3) there are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related accounts receivable is probable.

The typical leases contain initial terms of one to two years with renewal options and do not contain escalating rent amounts. Under the lease agreement of Menara CMY, the initial term of lease is one year. Provided that there are no existing breaches by the tenant, an irrecoverable annual renewal option is granted for up to twenty-nine years, with a maximum aggregate term of thirty years. Six-months' rent-free period under the operating lease agreement is treated as long-term rent concession, which is being amortized as an offset to revenues collected over the term of the underlying lease of 30 years on a straight-line basis.\nTable 90: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Cost of revenues </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue on plantation sales includes material supplies, subcontracting costs and transportation costs incurred for planting, fertilizing and harvesting the oil palm tree.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.\nWe conduct major businesses in Malaysia are subject to tax in its own jurisdiction.

We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments permit the use of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (also referred to as the Overnight Index Swap Rate, or OIS) as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. Public business entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 \"Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\" ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities.

We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied retrospectively to each period presented. The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have any impact on our financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred income tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in ASU 2015-17 are effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\u201d The amendments in this update require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in this update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted.

The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually. We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows.

The amendments in this ASU change how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-18 (ASU 2016-18), Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. This ASU provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in the ASU should be adopted on a retrospective basis. We do not expect that adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.", "item_7_truncated": "In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 \"Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\" ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities.

After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. We adopt the capitalization policy on development properties, which is guided by ASC Topic 835-20 Interest - Capitalization of Interest\u201d and ASC Topic 970 Real Estate - General\u201d. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the receipt of certificates of occupancy, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>Categories </td> <td> </td> <td>Location of properties </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected useful life </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Freehold plantation land </td> <td> </td> <td>Oil palm and durian plantation in Malaysia </td> <td> </td> <td>Indefinite, as per land titles </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Leasehold land under development </td> <td> </td> <td>Leasehold land in Puncak Alam, Malaysia </td> <td> </td> <td>Remaining lease life of 88 years, as per land titles </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Freehold land under development </td> <td> </td> <td>Freehold land in Sungai Long, Cheras, Selangor, Malaysia </td> <td> </td> <td>Indefinite, as per land titles </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Freehold land and land improvement for rental purpose </td> <td> </td> <td>Land portion of 15 story building Menara CMY\u201d in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia </td> <td> </td> <td>Indefinite, as per property titles </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Building structure and improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>Building structure of commercial buildings in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, including: 12 story building Megan Avenue\u201d and 15 story building Menara CMY\u201d </td> <td> </td> <td>33 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Office furniture and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-10 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Motor vehicle </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amount due to related parties </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,387,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,279,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial commitments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bank borrowing repayment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,971,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,421,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,875,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,159,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,514,851 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Finance lease obligation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,362,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,531,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,155,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,159,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,514,851 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16-Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.

While we believe that we will obtain external financing and the existing shareholders will continue to provide the additional cash to meet our obligations as they become due, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months.\n 26 \nIncome taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC Topic 740\u201d). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe are focused on the maintenance and operation of our oil palm and durian plantation in Malaysia. We believe that the value of our oil palm and durian plantation has increased since its acquisition , and while we have not pursued any discussions or received any formal offers regarding the sale of our plantation, we may consider sales offers in the future if a sale would maximize return to our investors.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to planning, developing, initial leasing and constructing a property are capitalized and classified as Real Estate in the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized development costs include interest, and other direct project costs incurred during the period of development. As of October 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no such capitalized interest.\n \u00b7 Acquired a 15 story commercial building located at Geran 10010, Lot 238 Section 43, Town and District of Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and \n (b) Rental income \n \u00b7 The severity and duration of the fair value decline; \nASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting\u201d establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with our internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in financial statements. During the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we operate in two reportable operating segments in Malaysia.\nWe have no outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nOur initial business plan launched in July 2010 broadly contemplated the development, distribution and operation of mobile and online social networking, ecommerce and search products and services. However, as a result of the challenges we experienced in implementing our m-commerce business plan, we entered the oil palm plantation and real estate businesses in 2012 and in 2014 discontinued our software business. Since the commencement of our business segments, we (through our subsidiaries):\nAs of October 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $685,876, accounts receivable of $137,207 and incurred a net loss of $911,522 for fiscal 2016.\n \u00b7 Finance leases \nAs of October 31, 2016, the amount of net assets held by our PRC subsidiary was $0.\nWe believe that we will require approximately RM5 to RM10 million in the aggregate to market, promote and complete construction of our Shah Alam 2 Eco Residential Development Project. To mitigate our development risk, on July 1, 2016, we entered into a MOU with YTB to jointly develop our Puncak Alam land. YTB is currently conducting its feasibility studies and business and market due diligence. In the event YTB elects not to proceed with the Proposed JV, we will reassess market conditions to determine whether we will seek additional development partners, proceed on other bases or suspend development efforts until market conditions improve. As of the approval date of this report, no definitive agreement has been concluded.\n Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions \nWe also follow the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d (\"ASC 820-10\"), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are Under Common Control. The amendments in this ASU change how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities.\n (a) Plantation sales \nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied retrospectively to each period presented. The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have any impact on our financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which includes amendments to accounting for income taxes at settlement, forfeitures, and net settlements to cover withholding taxes. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually. We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOn June 10, 2015, we received approval to develop our leasehold land located in Puncak Alam. Due to challenges in the current Malaysian real property market, in November 2015, we submitted a request to convert some our planned semi-detached and bungalow home parcels into cluster semi-detached homes to improve the marketability of the development. We received approval of our revised development plan on March 4, 2016.\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities are reported at fair value using the market approach based on the quoted prices in active markets at the reporting date. We classify the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 1 of fair value measurements. Any unrealized losses that are deemed other-than-temporary are included in current period earnings and removed from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n 30 \nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $518,504, which consisted primarily of a net loss (excluding non-cash depreciation and bad debt written off) of $976,827 and a decrease in rental deposits from tenants of $118,894, offset by an increase in income tax payable of $296,773, an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $216,222, and an increase in accrued liabilities and other payables of $61,986.\n \u00b7 Revenue recognition \nWe generate rental income from our 12 story and 15 story commercial properties and anticipate generating income from the sale of developed properties. As of the date of this report, 2 of the 12 stories of our 12 story building have been leased to tenants at market rates. We are actively attempting to lease our 8 vacant units. We occupy the remaining two stories as our corporate headquarters.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was $1,685,549, which is primarily attributable to a decrease in time deposits of $1,731,975, offset by payments of plantation development costs of $37,289.\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2016, we recognized other income of $16,983 from forfeiture of BJ's deposit.\nCommercial Buildings\nOur real estate business experienced a 13% decrease in revenue from $1,763,101 for the year ended October 31, 2015, to $1,538,211 for the same period ended October 31, 2016. The decrease in our real estate revenue is attributable to the decrease in rental income from both the twelve story and fifteen story buildings.\nThe de-registration of our PRC subsidiary was approved by the PRC tax office in April 2015 and was approved by PRC State Administration of Industry and Commerce in August 2015.\n \u00b7 Deferred development costs \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses ( G&A\u201d). We incurred G&A expenses of $626,395 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, representing a decrease of 40%, as compared to $ 1,046,125 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. The decrease in G&A is primarily attributable to lower staff cost in fiscal 2016. Also, in fiscal 2015, we incurred consultancy fees on the development of the Puncak Alam project. No such costs were incurred in fiscal 2016.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $2,718,598, which is primarily attributable to an increase in time deposits made by us of $1,902,417, purchase of the marketable securities of $465,606, payments of plantation development costs of $44,153, an increase in construction in progress of $301,354 and the purchase of plant, property and equipment of $17,291, offset by the sales proceeds received from disposal of plant and equipment of $12,223.\nExcept for historical information, the matters discussed in this section are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond the Company's control. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report.\n \u00b7 Available-for-sale marketable securities \n 1. BJ's deposit of RM70,000 shall be forfeited by us; \nDeferred development costs consist of replanting costs of durian such as soil amendments, cultivation, fertilization and purchase costs of sapling. Costs related to durian development projects on our plantation land, are capitalized during the sapling, developing and planting durian fruit bunches and when the harvests are substantially available for commercial sale. Deferred development costs will then commence to be amortized as components of plantation costs and expenses.\n \u00b7 Evaluation of the factors that could cause individual securities to have an other-than-temporary impairment. \nIn November 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments permit the use of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (also referred to as the Overnight Index Swap Rate, or OIS) as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. Public business entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u00b7 Acquired 21.8921 hectares (54.10 acres) of vacant development land located in Selangor, Malaysia, which is subject to a 99-year leasehold, expiring July 30, 2100; \nParties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if we have the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPursuant to a 8-K filing on September 23, 2015, in order to concentrate on durian plantation, we suspended the direct operation of oil palm plantation and leased out the oil palm land to a third party, BJ Bentong Trading Company ( BJ\u201d) under an operating lease for 30 months from September 21, 2015 to March 20, 2018. Pursuant to this tenancy agreement, the tenant is entitled to manage the plantation, harvest and sell palm oil fresh fruit bunches and receive all proceeds thereto. Rental income of $93,530 and $18,788 was recognized for the year ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was included in revenue from plantation business.\n 28 \n\nOn September 29, 2016, we entered into a letter with BJ agreement pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed to terminate the Tenancy Agreement upon the following conditions:\nCost of revenue on plantation sales includes material supplies, subcontracting costs and transportation costs incurred for planting, fertilizing and harvesting the oil palm tree. Transport and handling costs associated with the distribution of fresh fruit bunches to the customers are also included in cost of revenues.\nWe commenced planting premium durian, of the Musang King\u201d variety, in the first quarter of calendar year 2014. As of the date of this report, we have replanted 130 acres of our oil palm with premium durian trees. In November 2016, we began planting an additional 150 acres of durian. We planted an average of 35 trees per acre and anticipate an average production of 50 grade A fruits per tree for each of the two harvesting seasons per year.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nBased upon the aforementioned criteria, we wrote off $nil and $25,850 accounts receivable on uncollectible rental receivable for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n \u00b7 Foreign currencies translation \nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred income tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in ASU 2015-17 are effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nResidential Property Development\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.\nCost related to real estate business shown on the accompanying statements of operations include costs associated with land tax, on-site and property management personnel, repairs and maintenance, property insurance, marketing, landscaping and other on-site and related administrative costs. Utility expenses are paid directly by tenants.\n 22 \nSummarized financial information regarding each revenue generating segment for the year ended October 31, 2016 is as follows:\nOverview\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2016, $135,597 of losses previously classified in other comprehensive losses were reclassified into earnings to recognize an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. No such other-than-temporary decline in fair value was recognized during the year ended October 31, 2015.\nThe oil palm business is a highly regulated industry with prices subject to wide fluctuations due to factors beyond our control such as weather conditions, competition, global demand and government policies. Management has limited experience operating in this industry and may not be able to successfully navigate all industry specific factors in addition to any geopolitical factors in Malaysia. If we are not able to successfully respond to any of these or other factors, our business operations and financial results may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully operate a multi-national oilseeds business in conjunction with our other business segments given management's limited experience.\n \u00b7 Accounts receivable \nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard should be applied prospectively for investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting after the effective date. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 31, 2016:\nUnless otherwise noted, all currency figures quoted as U.S. dollars\u201d, dollars\u201d or $\u201d refer to the legal currency of the United States. References to MYR\u201d or RM\u201d are to the Malaysian Ringgit, the legal currency of Malaysia. Throughout this report, assets and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders' equity.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, \"Presentation of Financial Statements-Going concern (Subtopic 205-40) which provides guidance to an organization's management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. This guidance in ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of October 31, 2015, the amount of net assets held by our PRC subsidiary was $74,595, all of which cash is restricted.\nOur oil palm and durian plantation business experienced a 31% decline with net revenue decreasing from $156,642 for the year ended October 31, 2015, to $108,516 for the same period ended October 31, 2016. Revenue from our plantation business decreased when we contracted out the management and operation of our oil palm plantation from September 2015 to September 2016, as well as utilizing 130 acres of the land for durian plantation.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-18 (ASU 2016-18), Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. This ASU provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in the ASU should be adopted on a retrospective basis. We do not expect that adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue was approximately 38%, or $630,418, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, with real estate and plantation sales accounting for approximately 39% and 33%, respectively, of the respective net revenue. Cost of revenue for the year ended October 31, 2015 was $739,867. Cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue for the year ended October 31, 2015 was approximately 39%, with real estate and plantation sales accounting for approximately 37% and 53%, respectively, of the respective net revenue.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $2,517,508, consisting primarily of proceeds from new bank borrowings of $10,494,084 and revolving line of credit of $3,997,442, offset by the repayments of advances from Weng Kung Wong, our Chief Executive Officer and director, of $1,051,548, repayment on bank loans of $10,920,071 and payments on a finance lease of $2,399.\nWe expect investing cash outflows to increase when we develop our durian plantation until the orchard matures and begins to generate revenues in 2019 at the earliest. We also expect investing cash outflows to increase due to expenditures associated with developing our residential projects.\n \u00b7 Segment reporting \nTranslation of amounts from the local currency of us into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective years:\nOur ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.19:1 and 0.50:1 as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLeases that transfer substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership to the lessee, other than legal title, are accounted for as finance leases. Substantially all of the risks or benefits of ownership are deemed to have been transferred if any one of the four criteria is met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease containing a bargain purchase option, (iii) the lease term exceeding 75% of the estimated economic life of the leased asset, (iv) the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeding 90% of the fair value. At the inception of a finance lease, we as the lessee records an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments. The leased asset is amortized over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life if title does not transfer to us, while the leased asset is depreciated in accordance with our depreciation policy if the title is to eventually transfer to us. The periodic rent payments made during the lease term are allocated between a reduction in the obligation and interest element using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 835-30, Imputation of Interest\u201d.\n 29 \nWe expect rental income from our real estate operations to stabilize once our two commercial properties are at or near full capacity. We expect to continue to rely on cash generated through financing from our existing shareholders and private placements of our securities, however, to finance our operations and future acquisitions.\nG&A as a percentage of net revenue was approximately 38% and 54% for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a general matter, we expect our G&A to increase in the foreseeable future as we acquire real estate or other businesses and assets.\nWe have used the latest planting technology in 2016, which we hope will reduce the maturity time of the durian tree from 5 years to 3 years. All the durian trees planted on the 130 acres will begin to fruit by 2019 at the latest. Accordingly, we do not expect revenue from our durian orchard until calendar year 2019. At this time, we do not expect our durian orchard to exceed 280 acres in the near future.\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\u201d The amendments in this update require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in this update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statements\u201d, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders' equity. The gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders' equity.\nPolicy for Capitalizing Development Cost\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. The discussion and analysis that follow should be read together with the section entitled Forward Looking Statements\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n \u00b7 Comprehensive income \nThese consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. We extend unsecured credit to our customers in the ordinary course of business but mitigates the associated risks by performing credit checks and actively pursuing past due accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established and determined based on managements' assessment of known requirements, aging of receivables, payment history, the customer's current credit worthiness and the economic environment. We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for any estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. For the receivables that are past due or not being paid according to payment terms, the appropriate actions are taken to exhaust all means of collection, including seeking legal resolution in a court of law. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net). In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of ASU 2014-09 and 2014-16, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. These ASUs clarify the implementation guidance on a few narrow areas and adds some practical expedients to the guidance Topic 606. The Company is evaluating the effect the ASUs will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of these standards on our ongoing financial reporting.\n \u00b7 Acquired Dunford Corporation Sdn. Bhd., or Dunford, whose primary assets consist of two parcels of undeveloped land located in Selangor, Malaysia aggregating approximately 31 acres; \nNet Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities.\n \u00b7 Property, plant and equipment \nWe generally lease the units under operating leases with terms of two years or less. For the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded $1,538,211 and $1,763,101, respectively, in lease revenue, based upon our annual rental over the life of the lease under operating lease, using the straight-line method in accordance with ASC Topic 970-605, Real Estate - General - Revenue Recognition\u201d ( ASC Topic 970-605\u201d).\nOur 15 story building is fully leased to Le Apple which operates a boutique hotel on the premises. The Rental Agreement has an initial term of one (1) year commencing December 1, 2013 and expiring November 30, 2014. Provided that there are no existing breaches by Le Apple, we will be required to renew the lease for additional one-year terms up to twenty-nine years, for a maximum aggregate term of thirty years. Our current monthly rental rate is RM400,000 (approximately $95,386), which rate is increased every three years by 5% to 10% or to the then prevailing market rate, whichever is lower. Our current rate represents a decrease from our initial monthly rental rate of RM550,000 due to unfavorable market conditions.\nChallenges From Our Real Estate Operations\nOnce we begin real estate development, we expect gross profit derived from our real estate business to gradually increase as we commence sales activities with respect to our developed properties. We also expect our plantation revenue to increase once our premium durian orchard has matured and is able to produce grade A fruits for distribution. We expect the fruits to begin generating revenue sometime in 2019.\nThe functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollars ( US$\u201d) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$, which is the reporting currency. In addition, we maintain our books and record in a local currency, Malaysian Ringgit ( MYR\u201d or RM\u201d), Hong Kong Dollars ( HK$\u201d) and Renminbi Yuan ( RMB\u201d), which is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates.\nWe expect to incur significantly greater expenses in the near future, including the contractual obligations that we discussed below, to begin development activities. We also expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our finance and administrative staff, add infrastructure, and incur additional costs related to being an accelerated filer, including directors' and officers' insurance and increased professional fees.\n \u00b7 Rental concession \nNet Revenue. We generated net revenue of $1,646,727 and $1,919,743 for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with our oil palm and durian plantation and real estate businesses accounting for 7% and 93% of the net revenue, respectively, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, our oil palm and durian plantation and real estate businesses accounted for approximately 8% and 92% of net revenue, respectively.\nComparison of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015\n 3. BJ shall indemnify us for a period of six (6) months after the termination of the Tenancy Agreement against all and any damages, loss, expenses or other cost on the property and or the oil palm trees regardless of whether such damage arose as a result of the act, omission or negligence of BJ or its agents and representatives. \n \u00b7 Acquired a 12 story commercial building located at Megan Avenue 1, No. 189, Jalan Tun Razak, 50400 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. \nGross Profit. We achieved a gross profit of $1,016,309 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, as compared to $1,179,876 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, with real estate rental income and plantation sales accounting for approximately 93% and 7%, respectively of total gross profit. The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the change in our plantation business model and lower rental income on our commercial properties.\n 25 \nAs we continue to develop, we may continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenue which may cause our gross profit to fluctuate.\n 27 \nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u00b7 Recent accounting pronouncements \nRealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in current period earnings. For purposes of computing realized gains and losses, the cost basis of each investment sold is generally based on the weighted average cost method.\nAs of October 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $836,794, accounts receivable of $112,439 and incurred a net loss of $1,593,434 for fiscal 2015.\nWe conduct major businesses in Malaysia are subject to tax in its own jurisdiction. As a result of our business activities, we will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the local and foreign tax authorities.\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which the assets become fully operational:\n \u00b7 Fair value of financial instruments \nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $1,691,179 consisting primarily of repayments of advances from Weng Kung Wong, our Chief Executive Officer and director, of $924,780 and repayments on bank loans of $764,215.\nWe capitalize leasing costs which include commissions paid to outside brokers, legal costs incurred to negotiate and document a lease agreement and any internal costs that may be applicable. We allocate these costs to individual tenant leases and amortize them over the related lease term.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2016, we operated in two business segments: (i) our oil palm and durian plantation business; and (ii) our real estate business. Our oil palm and durian plantation business is operated through Virtual Setup Sdn. Bhd., or VSSB, and our real estate business is primarily operated through PGCG Assets Holdings Sdn. Bhd., or PGCG Assets, and Dunford Corporation Sdn Bhd.\n \u00b7 Deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer; and \nOn September 8, 2016, the Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Ministry of Malaysia announced the introduction of an initiative that will enable property developers to provide loans to buyers at an annual interest rate between 12 and 18 percent. Developers will be able to begin applying to the ministry on September 8, 2016, for a moneylending license. It is our understanding that loans made pursuant to such license will not be restricted to first time homebuyers.\nIncome Tax Expense. We recorded income tax expenses of $253,538 and $636,941 for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In fiscals 2016 and 2015, we recorded under-accrual of estimated Malaysian income tax of $9,692 and $271,568, respectively, for previous years. The Malaysian income tax in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was mainly related to the rental income being taxed as a non-business source pursuant to the Malaysian income tax rules.\nWe have separately identified the portion of freehold land and building structure, in which freehold land is not subject to amortization and buildings are to be amortized over 33 years on a straight-line method, based on applicable local laws and practice.\nExpenditure for maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the statement of operations.\n \u00b7 Related parties \n 31 \n 20 \n\nLong-lived assets primarily include freehold plantation land, leasehold land held for development, freehold land and land improvement for rental purpose and building structure and improvements. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\u201d, we generally conduct our annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the lowest level group. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset. There has been no impairment charge for the years presented.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management's current judgments. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements.\n 24 \nASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income\u201d establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying statements of stockholders' equity consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n \u00b7 Cost of revenues \nAs of October 31, 2016, we suffered from continuous operating loss from prior years and working capital deficit of $5,111,507. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders or other capital sources. Management believes that the continuing financial support from the existing shareholders and external financing will provide the additional cash to meet our obligations as they become due.\n \u00b7 Acquired an oil palm plantation in Malaysia which is operated through VSSB; \nOther Income, net. We incurred net other expenses of $1,047,898 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, as compared to $1,090,244 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. The decrease is attributable primarily to a decrease in interest rate charged on our bank loans. Our net other expenses for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of interest expense on our bank loans. In fiscal 2016, we recorded an impairment of $135,597 on our investments, resulting from the other-than-temporary decline in their fair value.\nWe continue to maintain a cautious but positive outlook for the residential market based upon Malaysia's stable employment outlook, growth in household income, formation of new households, and increased demand for affordable residential property from first time home buyers. Developers such as us are facing challenges of inconsistent supply and high cost of labor, increased costs of building materials (such as cement and steel bars) and general increased costs of doing business. Our market is also sensitive to changes in lending rates and lending requirements as many homebuyers rely on financing to make purchases. As a result, government or bank policies that result in increased interest rates and or stricter lending requirements may adversely affect the sales of our developed properties.\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we invested in equity securities listed on Bursa Malaysia with a total cost of $265,606 and escrow funds (which invested in equity securities listed in the U.S.) with a total cost of $200,000. The Company entered into an escrow agreement with Peijin Wu Hoppe ( Hoppe\u201d), our former director, to set up an escrow fund up to $500,000 as a reserve to indemnify Hoppe from any claim of liability until July 29, 2022, the seventh year anniversary of the termination of Director Retainer Agreement, or any mutual agreement with Hoppe and us. The unrealized loss representing the change in fair value of $60,590 and $106,783 was charged against accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.\nWe recognize our revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition\u201d, upon the delivery of our plantation products when: (1) title and risk of loss are transferred; (2) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (3) there are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related accounts receivable is probable. Our sale arrangements do not contain general rights of return.", "item_7_text": "In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 \"Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\" ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. It is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\n 21 \nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $162,076, which consisted primarily of a net loss (excluding non-cash depreciation and impairment on available-for-sale securities) of $247,004 and a decrease in accrued liabilities and other payables of $39,778.\nWe have never paid dividends on our Common Stock. Our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development, acquisitions or expansion; consequently, we do not expect to pay dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\n \u00b7 Income taxes \nCurrency and exchange rate\nOur PRC Subsidiary\n 2. All staff, laborers, machinery and tools shall be removed from the premises and the premises returned to us no later than September 30, 2016; and \nWe regularly evaluate whether the decline in fair value of available-for-sale securities is other-than-temporary and objective evidence of impairment could include:\nThe carrying value of our financial instruments (excluding obligation under finance lease): cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits and other receivables, deferred revenue, income tax payable, amount due to a director, accrued liabilities and other payables approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.\nGoing Concern Uncertainties\nWe lease store location and office spaces to the tenants under operating lease arrangements. The Company receives rental income from the real estates we own for a stated period of times. Rental income is recognized over the life of the operating lease agreement as it is earned in the period under ASC Topic 970-605. The typical leases contain initial terms of one to two years with renewal options and do not contain escalating rent amounts. Under the lease agreement of Menara CMY, the initial term of lease is one year. Provided that there are no existing breaches by the tenant, an irrecoverable annual renewal option is granted for up to twenty-nine years, with a maximum aggregate term of thirty years. Six-months' rent-free period under the operating lease agreement is treated as long-term rent concession, which is being amortized as an offset to revenues collected over the term of the underlying lease of 30 years on a straight-line basis.\nA variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. We adopt the capitalization policy on development properties, which is guided by ASC Topic 835-20 Interest - Capitalization of Interest\u201d and ASC Topic 970 Real Estate - General\u201d. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the receipt of certificates of occupancy, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16-Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This ASU improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue from the sale of oil palm is recognized upon confirmation of the weight of fresh fruit bunches and transport to the customer, when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed, the sales price is fixed or determinable at the date of sale, and collectibility is reasonably assured.\nManagement believes, based on the current market prices or interest rates for similar debt instruments, the fair value of its obligation under finance lease approximates the carrying amount.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe are considering applying for such money lender's license to enable us to provide financing to prospective buyers of our future properties. If we apply and are successful in obtaining such license, we hope that we will be able to boost sales of our properties that we have earmarked for development.\nThe following table sets forth certain operational data for the years indicated:\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nChallenges From Our Oil Palm Operations\n 23 \nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nNet Cash Used In Operating Activities.\nOur continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and public offerings, capital leases and short-term and long-term debts. In fiscal 2015, we obtained new short-term bank borrowings of $4.0 million. In fiscal year 2014, we raised approximately $6.7 million from sales of the securities of our subsidiaries. While we believe that we will obtain external financing and the existing shareholders will continue to provide the additional cash to meet our obligations as they become due, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months.\n 26 \nIncome taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC Topic 740\u201d). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe are focused on the maintenance and operation of our oil palm and durian plantation in Malaysia. We believe that the value of our oil palm and durian plantation has increased since its acquisition , and while we have not pursued any discussions or received any formal offers regarding the sale of our plantation, we may consider sales offers in the future if a sale would maximize return to our investors.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to planning, developing, initial leasing and constructing a property are capitalized and classified as Real Estate in the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized development costs include interest, and other direct project costs incurred during the period of development. As of October 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no such capitalized interest.\n \u00b7 Acquired a 15 story commercial building located at Geran 10010, Lot 238 Section 43, Town and District of Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and \n (b) Rental income \n \u00b7 The severity and duration of the fair value decline; \nASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting\u201d establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with our internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in financial statements. During the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we operate in two reportable operating segments in Malaysia.\nWe have no outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nOur initial business plan launched in July 2010 broadly contemplated the development, distribution and operation of mobile and online social networking, ecommerce and search products and services. However, as a result of the challenges we experienced in implementing our m-commerce business plan, we entered the oil palm plantation and real estate businesses in 2012 and in 2014 discontinued our software business. Since the commencement of our business segments, we (through our subsidiaries):\nAs of October 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $685,876, accounts receivable of $137,207 and incurred a net loss of $911,522 for fiscal 2016.\n \u00b7 Finance leases \nAs of October 31, 2016, the amount of net assets held by our PRC subsidiary was $0.\nWe believe that we will require approximately RM5 to RM10 million in the aggregate to market, promote and complete construction of our Shah Alam 2 Eco Residential Development Project. To mitigate our development risk, on July 1, 2016, we entered into a MOU with YTB to jointly develop our Puncak Alam land. YTB is currently conducting its feasibility studies and business and market due diligence. In the event YTB elects not to proceed with the Proposed JV, we will reassess market conditions to determine whether we will seek additional development partners, proceed on other bases or suspend development efforts until market conditions improve. As of the approval date of this report, no definitive agreement has been concluded.\n Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions \nWe also follow the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d (\"ASC 820-10\"), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are Under Common Control. The amendments in this ASU change how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities.\n (a) Plantation sales \nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied retrospectively to each period presented. The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have any impact on our financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which includes amendments to accounting for income taxes at settlement, forfeitures, and net settlements to cover withholding taxes. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually. We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOn June 10, 2015, we received approval to develop our leasehold land located in Puncak Alam. Due to challenges in the current Malaysian real property market, in November 2015, we submitted a request to convert some our planned semi-detached and bungalow home parcels into cluster semi-detached homes to improve the marketability of the development. We received approval of our revised development plan on March 4, 2016.\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities are reported at fair value using the market approach based on the quoted prices in active markets at the reporting date. We classify the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 1 of fair value measurements. Any unrealized losses that are deemed other-than-temporary are included in current period earnings and removed from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n 30 \nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $518,504, which consisted primarily of a net loss (excluding non-cash depreciation and bad debt written off) of $976,827 and a decrease in rental deposits from tenants of $118,894, offset by an increase in income tax payable of $296,773, an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $216,222, and an increase in accrued liabilities and other payables of $61,986.\n \u00b7 Revenue recognition \nWe generate rental income from our 12 story and 15 story commercial properties and anticipate generating income from the sale of developed properties. As of the date of this report, 2 of the 12 stories of our 12 story building have been leased to tenants at market rates. We are actively attempting to lease our 8 vacant units. We occupy the remaining two stories as our corporate headquarters.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was $1,685,549, which is primarily attributable to a decrease in time deposits of $1,731,975, offset by payments of plantation development costs of $37,289.\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2016, we recognized other income of $16,983 from forfeiture of BJ's deposit.\nCommercial Buildings\nOur real estate business experienced a 13% decrease in revenue from $1,763,101 for the year ended October 31, 2015, to $1,538,211 for the same period ended October 31, 2016. The decrease in our real estate revenue is attributable to the decrease in rental income from both the twelve story and fifteen story buildings.\nThe de-registration of our PRC subsidiary was approved by the PRC tax office in April 2015 and was approved by PRC State Administration of Industry and Commerce in August 2015.\n \u00b7 Deferred development costs \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses ( G&A\u201d). We incurred G&A expenses of $626,395 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, representing a decrease of 40%, as compared to $ 1,046,125 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. The decrease in G&A is primarily attributable to lower staff cost in fiscal 2016. Also, in fiscal 2015, we incurred consultancy fees on the development of the Puncak Alam project. No such costs were incurred in fiscal 2016.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $2,718,598, which is primarily attributable to an increase in time deposits made by us of $1,902,417, purchase of the marketable securities of $465,606, payments of plantation development costs of $44,153, an increase in construction in progress of $301,354 and the purchase of plant, property and equipment of $17,291, offset by the sales proceeds received from disposal of plant and equipment of $12,223.\nExcept for historical information, the matters discussed in this section are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond the Company's control. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report.\n \u00b7 Available-for-sale marketable securities \n 1. BJ's deposit of RM70,000 shall be forfeited by us; \nDeferred development costs consist of replanting costs of durian such as soil amendments, cultivation, fertilization and purchase costs of sapling. Costs related to durian development projects on our plantation land, are capitalized during the sapling, developing and planting durian fruit bunches and when the harvests are substantially available for commercial sale. Deferred development costs will then commence to be amortized as components of plantation costs and expenses.\n \u00b7 Evaluation of the factors that could cause individual securities to have an other-than-temporary impairment. \nIn November 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments permit the use of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (also referred to as the Overnight Index Swap Rate, or OIS) as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. Public business entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u00b7 Acquired 21.8921 hectares (54.10 acres) of vacant development land located in Selangor, Malaysia, which is subject to a 99-year leasehold, expiring July 30, 2100; \nParties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if we have the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPursuant to a 8-K filing on September 23, 2015, in order to concentrate on durian plantation, we suspended the direct operation of oil palm plantation and leased out the oil palm land to a third party, BJ Bentong Trading Company ( BJ\u201d) under an operating lease for 30 months from September 21, 2015 to March 20, 2018. Pursuant to this tenancy agreement, the tenant is entitled to manage the plantation, harvest and sell palm oil fresh fruit bunches and receive all proceeds thereto. Rental income of $93,530 and $18,788 was recognized for the year ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was included in revenue from plantation business.\n 28 \n\nOn September 29, 2016, we entered into a letter with BJ agreement pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed to terminate the Tenancy Agreement upon the following conditions:\nCost of revenue on plantation sales includes material supplies, subcontracting costs and transportation costs incurred for planting, fertilizing and harvesting the oil palm tree. Transport and handling costs associated with the distribution of fresh fruit bunches to the customers are also included in cost of revenues.\nWe commenced planting premium durian, of the Musang King\u201d variety, in the first quarter of calendar year 2014. As of the date of this report, we have replanted 130 acres of our oil palm with premium durian trees. In November 2016, we began planting an additional 150 acres of durian. We planted an average of 35 trees per acre and anticipate an average production of 50 grade A fruits per tree for each of the two harvesting seasons per year.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nBased upon the aforementioned criteria, we wrote off $nil and $25,850 accounts receivable on uncollectible rental receivable for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n \u00b7 Foreign currencies translation \nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred income tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in ASU 2015-17 are effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nResidential Property Development\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.\nCost related to real estate business shown on the accompanying statements of operations include costs associated with land tax, on-site and property management personnel, repairs and maintenance, property insurance, marketing, landscaping and other on-site and related administrative costs. Utility expenses are paid directly by tenants.\n 22 \nSummarized financial information regarding each revenue generating segment for the year ended October 31, 2016 is as follows:\nOverview\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2016, $135,597 of losses previously classified in other comprehensive losses were reclassified into earnings to recognize an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. No such other-than-temporary decline in fair value was recognized during the year ended October 31, 2015.\nThe oil palm business is a highly regulated industry with prices subject to wide fluctuations due to factors beyond our control such as weather conditions, competition, global demand and government policies. Management has limited experience operating in this industry and may not be able to successfully navigate all industry specific factors in addition to any geopolitical factors in Malaysia. If we are not able to successfully respond to any of these or other factors, our business operations and financial results may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully operate a multi-national oilseeds business in conjunction with our other business segments given management's limited experience.\n \u00b7 Accounts receivable \nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard should be applied prospectively for investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting after the effective date. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 31, 2016:\nUnless otherwise noted, all currency figures quoted as U.S. dollars\u201d, dollars\u201d or $\u201d refer to the legal currency of the United States. References to MYR\u201d or RM\u201d are to the Malaysian Ringgit, the legal currency of Malaysia. Throughout this report, assets and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders' equity.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, \"Presentation of Financial Statements-Going concern (Subtopic 205-40) which provides guidance to an organization's management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. This guidance in ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of October 31, 2015, the amount of net assets held by our PRC subsidiary was $74,595, all of which cash is restricted.\nOur oil palm and durian plantation business experienced a 31% decline with net revenue decreasing from $156,642 for the year ended October 31, 2015, to $108,516 for the same period ended October 31, 2016. Revenue from our plantation business decreased when we contracted out the management and operation of our oil palm plantation from September 2015 to September 2016, as well as utilizing 130 acres of the land for durian plantation.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-18 (ASU 2016-18), Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. This ASU provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in the ASU should be adopted on a retrospective basis. We do not expect that adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue was approximately 38%, or $630,418, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, with real estate and plantation sales accounting for approximately 39% and 33%, respectively, of the respective net revenue. Cost of revenue for the year ended October 31, 2015 was $739,867. Cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue for the year ended October 31, 2015 was approximately 39%, with real estate and plantation sales accounting for approximately 37% and 53%, respectively, of the respective net revenue.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $2,517,508, consisting primarily of proceeds from new bank borrowings of $10,494,084 and revolving line of credit of $3,997,442, offset by the repayments of advances from Weng Kung Wong, our Chief Executive Officer and director, of $1,051,548, repayment on bank loans of $10,920,071 and payments on a finance lease of $2,399.\nWe expect investing cash outflows to increase when we develop our durian plantation until the orchard matures and begins to generate revenues in 2019 at the earliest. We also expect investing cash outflows to increase due to expenditures associated with developing our residential projects.\n \u00b7 Segment reporting \nTranslation of amounts from the local currency of us into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective years:\nOur ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.19:1 and 0.50:1 as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLeases that transfer substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership to the lessee, other than legal title, are accounted for as finance leases. Substantially all of the risks or benefits of ownership are deemed to have been transferred if any one of the four criteria is met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease containing a bargain purchase option, (iii) the lease term exceeding 75% of the estimated economic life of the leased asset, (iv) the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeding 90% of the fair value. At the inception of a finance lease, we as the lessee records an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments. The leased asset is amortized over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life if title does not transfer to us, while the leased asset is depreciated in accordance with our depreciation policy if the title is to eventually transfer to us. The periodic rent payments made during the lease term are allocated between a reduction in the obligation and interest element using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 835-30, Imputation of Interest\u201d.\n 29 \nWe expect rental income from our real estate operations to stabilize once our two commercial properties are at or near full capacity. We expect to continue to rely on cash generated through financing from our existing shareholders and private placements of our securities, however, to finance our operations and future acquisitions.\nG&A as a percentage of net revenue was approximately 38% and 54% for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a general matter, we expect our G&A to increase in the foreseeable future as we acquire real estate or other businesses and assets.\nWe have used the latest planting technology in 2016, which we hope will reduce the maturity time of the durian tree from 5 years to 3 years. All the durian trees planted on the 130 acres will begin to fruit by 2019 at the latest. Accordingly, we do not expect revenue from our durian orchard until calendar year 2019. At this time, we do not expect our durian orchard to exceed 280 acres in the near future.\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\u201d The amendments in this update require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in this update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statements\u201d, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders' equity. The gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders' equity.\nPolicy for Capitalizing Development Cost\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. The discussion and analysis that follow should be read together with the section entitled Forward Looking Statements\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n \u00b7 Comprehensive income \nThese consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. We extend unsecured credit to our customers in the ordinary course of business but mitigates the associated risks by performing credit checks and actively pursuing past due accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established and determined based on managements' assessment of known requirements, aging of receivables, payment history, the customer's current credit worthiness and the economic environment. We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for any estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. For the receivables that are past due or not being paid according to payment terms, the appropriate actions are taken to exhaust all means of collection, including seeking legal resolution in a court of law. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net). In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of ASU 2014-09 and 2014-16, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. These ASUs clarify the implementation guidance on a few narrow areas and adds some practical expedients to the guidance Topic 606. The Company is evaluating the effect the ASUs will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of these standards on our ongoing financial reporting.\n \u00b7 Acquired Dunford Corporation Sdn. Bhd., or Dunford, whose primary assets consist of two parcels of undeveloped land located in Selangor, Malaysia aggregating approximately 31 acres; \nNet Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities.\n \u00b7 Property, plant and equipment \nWe generally lease the units under operating leases with terms of two years or less. For the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded $1,538,211 and $1,763,101, respectively, in lease revenue, based upon our annual rental over the life of the lease under operating lease, using the straight-line method in accordance with ASC Topic 970-605, Real Estate - General - Revenue Recognition\u201d ( ASC Topic 970-605\u201d).\nOur 15 story building is fully leased to Le Apple which operates a boutique hotel on the premises. The Rental Agreement has an initial term of one (1) year commencing December 1, 2013 and expiring November 30, 2014. Provided that there are no existing breaches by Le Apple, we will be required to renew the lease for additional one-year terms up to twenty-nine years, for a maximum aggregate term of thirty years. Our current monthly rental rate is RM400,000 (approximately $95,386), which rate is increased every three years by 5% to 10% or to the then prevailing market rate, whichever is lower. Our current rate represents a decrease from our initial monthly rental rate of RM550,000 due to unfavorable market conditions.\nChallenges From Our Real Estate Operations\nOnce we begin real estate development, we expect gross profit derived from our real estate business to gradually increase as we commence sales activities with respect to our developed properties. We also expect our plantation revenue to increase once our premium durian orchard has matured and is able to produce grade A fruits for distribution. We expect the fruits to begin generating revenue sometime in 2019.\nThe functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollars ( US$\u201d) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$, which is the reporting currency. In addition, we maintain our books and record in a local currency, Malaysian Ringgit ( MYR\u201d or RM\u201d), Hong Kong Dollars ( HK$\u201d) and Renminbi Yuan ( RMB\u201d), which is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates.\nWe expect to incur significantly greater expenses in the near future, including the contractual obligations that we discussed below, to begin development activities. We also expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our finance and administrative staff, add infrastructure, and incur additional costs related to being an accelerated filer, including directors' and officers' insurance and increased professional fees.\n \u00b7 Rental concession \nNet Revenue. We generated net revenue of $1,646,727 and $1,919,743 for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with our oil palm and durian plantation and real estate businesses accounting for 7% and 93% of the net revenue, respectively, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, our oil palm and durian plantation and real estate businesses accounted for approximately 8% and 92% of net revenue, respectively.\nComparison of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015\n 3. BJ shall indemnify us for a period of six (6) months after the termination of the Tenancy Agreement against all and any damages, loss, expenses or other cost on the property and or the oil palm trees regardless of whether such damage arose as a result of the act, omission or negligence of BJ or its agents and representatives. \n \u00b7 Acquired a 12 story commercial building located at Megan Avenue 1, No. 189, Jalan Tun Razak, 50400 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. \nGross Profit. We achieved a gross profit of $1,016,309 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, as compared to $1,179,876 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, with real estate rental income and plantation sales accounting for approximately 93% and 7%, respectively of total gross profit. The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the change in our plantation business model and lower rental income on our commercial properties.\n 25 \nAs we continue to develop, we may continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenue which may cause our gross profit to fluctuate.\n 27 \nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u00b7 Recent accounting pronouncements \nRealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in current period earnings. For purposes of computing realized gains and losses, the cost basis of each investment sold is generally based on the weighted average cost method.\nAs of October 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $836,794, accounts receivable of $112,439 and incurred a net loss of $1,593,434 for fiscal 2015.\nWe conduct major businesses in Malaysia are subject to tax in its own jurisdiction. As a result of our business activities, we will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the local and foreign tax authorities.\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which the assets become fully operational:\n \u00b7 Fair value of financial instruments \nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $1,691,179 consisting primarily of repayments of advances from Weng Kung Wong, our Chief Executive Officer and director, of $924,780 and repayments on bank loans of $764,215.\nWe capitalize leasing costs which include commissions paid to outside brokers, legal costs incurred to negotiate and document a lease agreement and any internal costs that may be applicable. We allocate these costs to individual tenant leases and amortize them over the related lease term.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2016, we operated in two business segments: (i) our oil palm and durian plantation business; and (ii) our real estate business. Our oil palm and durian plantation business is operated through Virtual Setup Sdn. Bhd., or VSSB, and our real estate business is primarily operated through PGCG Assets Holdings Sdn. Bhd., or PGCG Assets, and Dunford Corporation Sdn Bhd.\n \u00b7 Deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer; and \nOn September 8, 2016, the Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Ministry of Malaysia announced the introduction of an initiative that will enable property developers to provide loans to buyers at an annual interest rate between 12 and 18 percent. Developers will be able to begin applying to the ministry on September 8, 2016, for a moneylending license. It is our understanding that loans made pursuant to such license will not be restricted to first time homebuyers.\nIncome Tax Expense. We recorded income tax expenses of $253,538 and $636,941 for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In fiscals 2016 and 2015, we recorded under-accrual of estimated Malaysian income tax of $9,692 and $271,568, respectively, for previous years. The Malaysian income tax in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was mainly related to the rental income being taxed as a non-business source pursuant to the Malaysian income tax rules.\nWe have separately identified the portion of freehold land and building structure, in which freehold land is not subject to amortization and buildings are to be amortized over 33 years on a straight-line method, based on applicable local laws and practice.\nExpenditure for maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the statement of operations.\n \u00b7 Related parties \n 31 \n 20 \n\nLong-lived assets primarily include freehold plantation land, leasehold land held for development, freehold land and land improvement for rental purpose and building structure and improvements. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\u201d, we generally conduct our annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the lowest level group. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset. There has been no impairment charge for the years presented.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management's current judgments. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements.\n 24 \nASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income\u201d establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying statements of stockholders' equity consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n \u00b7 Cost of revenues \nAs of October 31, 2016, we suffered from continuous operating loss from prior years and working capital deficit of $5,111,507. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders or other capital sources. Management believes that the continuing financial support from the existing shareholders and external financing will provide the additional cash to meet our obligations as they become due.\n \u00b7 Acquired an oil palm plantation in Malaysia which is operated through VSSB; \nOther Income, net. We incurred net other expenses of $1,047,898 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, as compared to $1,090,244 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. The decrease is attributable primarily to a decrease in interest rate charged on our bank loans. Our net other expenses for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of interest expense on our bank loans. In fiscal 2016, we recorded an impairment of $135,597 on our investments, resulting from the other-than-temporary decline in their fair value.\nWe continue to maintain a cautious but positive outlook for the residential market based upon Malaysia's stable employment outlook, growth in household income, formation of new households, and increased demand for affordable residential property from first time home buyers. Developers such as us are facing challenges of inconsistent supply and high cost of labor, increased costs of building materials (such as cement and steel bars) and general increased costs of doing business. Our market is also sensitive to changes in lending rates and lending requirements as many homebuyers rely on financing to make purchases. As a result, government or bank policies that result in increased interest rates and or stricter lending requirements may adversely affect the sales of our developed properties.\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we invested in equity securities listed on Bursa Malaysia with a total cost of $265,606 and escrow funds (which invested in equity securities listed in the U.S.) with a total cost of $200,000. The Company entered into an escrow agreement with Peijin Wu Hoppe ( Hoppe\u201d), our former director, to set up an escrow fund up to $500,000 as a reserve to indemnify Hoppe from any claim of liability until July 29, 2022, the seventh year anniversary of the termination of Director Retainer Agreement, or any mutual agreement with Hoppe and us. The unrealized loss representing the change in fair value of $60,590 and $106,783 was charged against accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.\nWe recognize our revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition\u201d, upon the delivery of our plantation products when: (1) title and risk of loss are transferred; (2) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (3) there are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related accounts receivable is probable. Our sale arrangements do not contain general rights of return.", "item_7_tables": "Table 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended October 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>
