Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Ryerson Holding Corporation and Subsidiaries and the Notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the section entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBusiness\nRyerson Holding Corporation ( Ryerson Holding\u201d), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. ( JT Ryerson\u201d), a Delaware corporation. On December 17, 2014, Ryerson Inc., formerly a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, merged with and into JT Ryerson, which was previously an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, with JT Ryerson as the surviving corporation. As a result of such merger, from and after December 17, 2014, JT Ryerson has been a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC ( Platinum\u201d) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding common stock.\nWe are a leading distributor and value-added processor of industrial metals with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation ( Ryerson Canada\u201d), and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation ( Ryerson Mexico\u201d). In addition to our North American operations, we conduct materials distribution operations in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited ( Ryerson China\u201d). Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson China and Ryerson Mexico, together with their subsidiaries (including Ryerson Inc. prior to its dissolution through merger), are collectively referred to herein as Ryerson,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or the Company.\u201d\nIndustry and Operating Trends\nWe purchase large quantities of metal products from primary producers and sell these materials in smaller quantities to a wide variety of metals-consuming industries. More than 75% of the metals products sold are processed by us by burning, sawing, slitting, blanking, cutting to length or other techniques. We sell our products and services to many industries, including commercial ground transportation manufacturing, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable production, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing and oil & gas. In 2016, food processing and agricultural equipment, consumer durable and construction industries grew volumes compared to 2015, offset by declines in oil & gas, HVAC and ground transportation industries. The other two general industrial sectors of our business, metal fabricators and industrial machinery and equipment, showed a slight net gain in volume.\nThe metals service center industry is generally considered cyclical with periods of strong demand and higher prices followed by periods of weaker demand and lower prices due to the cyclical nature of the industries in which the largest consumers of metals operate. However, domestic metals prices are volatile and remain difficult to predict. In 2016, the metals service center industry experienced weak demand and improved but volatile pricing conditions. U.S. shipment volumes as measured by the Metals Service Center Institute declined by 6.2 percent in 2016 compared to the prior year. Meanwhile, carbon prices recovered from historical lows at the end of 2015, peaking in June 2016, only to correct in October 2016, before starting an upward trajectory that continued through the end of the year. Additionally, 2016 nickel and aluminum prices each increased by double-digits compared to 2015 average prices.\nSimilar to other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. At the request of our customers, we have entered into swaps in order to mitigate our customers' risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors' responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of our metals products. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of product to customers. The timing of shipment is substantially the same as the timing of delivery to customers given the proximity of our distribution sites to our customers.\nSales, cost of materials sold, gross profit and operating expense control are the principal factors that impact our profitability:\nNet Sales. Our sales volume and pricing is driven by market demand, which is largely determined by overall industrial production and conditions in specific industries in which our customers operate. Sales prices are also primarily driven by market factors such as overall demand and availability of product. Our net sales include revenue from product sales, net of returns, allowances, customer discounts and incentives.\nCost of materials sold. Cost of materials sold includes metal purchase and in-bound freight costs, third-party processing costs and direct and indirect internal processing costs. The cost of materials sold fluctuates with our sales volume and our ability to purchase metals at competitive prices. Increases in sales volume generally enable us both to improve purchasing leverage with suppliers, as we buy larger quantities of metals inventories, and to reduce operating expenses per ton sold.\nGross profit. Gross profit is the difference between net sales and the cost of materials sold. Our sales prices to our customers are subject to market competition. Achieving acceptable levels of gross profit is dependent on our acquiring metals at competitive prices, our ability to manage the impact of changing prices and efficiently managing our internal and external processing costs.\nOperating expenses. Optimizing business processes and asset utilization to lower fixed expenses such as employee, facility and truck fleet costs which cannot be rapidly reduced in times of declining volume, and maintaining low fixed cost structure in times of increasing sales volume, have a significant impact on our profitability. Operating expenses include costs related to warehousing and distributing our products as well as selling, general and administrative expenses.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the year ended

Average selling price decreased 10.0% reflecting weaker economic conditions in the metals market in 2016 compared to 2015. The average selling price per ton decreased in 2016 to $1,503 from $1,670 in 2015. Average selling prices per ton decreased for all of our product lines in 2016 with the largest decrease in our stainless steel plate, stainless steel flat and stainless steel long product lines. Tons sold increased 0.3% in 2016 with increases in shipments of stainless steel plate and stainless steel flat product lines offset by decreases in shipments of our carbon steel plate and carbon steel long product lines. Tons sold per ship day were 7,552 in 2016 as compared to 7,528 in 2015.\nCost of Materials Sold\nCost of materials sold decreased 11.9% to $2.3 billion in 2016 compared to $2.6 billion in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton. The average cost of materials sold per ton decreased to $1,203 in 2016 from $1,371 in 2015. The average cost of materials sold for our stainless steel plate, stainless steel flat and carbon steel plate product lines decreased more than our other products, in line with the change in average selling price per ton.\nDuring 2016, LIFO expense was $7 million related to increases in pricing for carbon products. During 2015, LIFO income was $97 million related to decreases in pricing for all product lines. As a result of falling average selling prices, LIFO income in 2015 was partially offset by a $38 million charge to record inventory at the lower of cost or market. In 2016, we recorded income of $14 million to adjust the lower of cost or market inventory reserve.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 20.0% in 2016 compared to 17.9% in 2015 due to, among other things, a decrease in cost of materials sold, as discussed above. Gross profit increased 0.5% to $570.6 million in 2016 as compared to $567.7 million in 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 15.3% in 2016 from 14.5% in 2015. Operating expenses in 2016 were $437.4 million, a decrease of $21.7 million from $459.1 million in 2015 primarily due to the following reasons:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Lower employee benefit costs of $11.0 million resulting mainly from a reduction in the net periodic benefit cost for pensions,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an impairment charge on assets of $7.7 million in 2015, primarily due to fixed asset impairments,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> lower salaries and wages of $6.3 million due to lower employee headcount,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> lower facility expenses, primarily taxes and repair and maintenance costs, of $6.2 million, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> lower administrative expenses, primarily due to lower outside technical services, of $3.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese changes were partially offset by:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> higher incentive compensation expense of $14.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a per ton basis, operating expenses decreased to $230 per ton in 2016 from $242 per ton in 2015.\nOperating Profit\nAs a result of the factors above, in 2016 we reported an operating profit of $133.2 million, or 4.7% of sales, compared to an operating profit of $108.6 million, or 3.4% of sales, in 2015.\nOther Expenses\nInterest and other expense on debt decreased to $89.9 million in 2016 from $96.3 million in 2015 primarily due to a lower principal amount of debt outstanding in 2016, partially offset by an increase in the interest rate on a portion of our outstanding Notes after we redeemed the $569.9 million outstanding balance our 9.0% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d), redeemed the $170.4 million outstanding balance of our 11.25% Senior Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes\u201d) and issued $650.0 million of new 11.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) in 2016. The year 2015 also included a $2.9 million charge to write-off a portion of the issuance costs associated with the Company's old revolving credit facility agreement upon entering into a new revolving credit facility agreement. Other income and (expense), net was expense of $17.2 million in 2016 compared to expense of $10.4 million in 2015. The year 2016 net expense is primarily related to a $8.7 million net loss on debt redemptions, a $4.7 million charge due to an other-than-temporary impairment recognized on an available-for-sale investment and foreign currency losses of $3.9 million. The year 2015 net expense primarily related to a $12.3 million charge due to an other-than-temporary impairment recognized on an available-for-sale investment, partially offset by foreign currency gains of $1.5 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $7.2 million in 2016 compared to an income tax expense of $3.7 million in 2015. The $7.2 million income tax expense in 2016 results predominantly from tax expense on earnings in the U.S. and the inability to benefit losses in our foreign subsidiaries due to valuation allowances. The $3.7 million income tax expense in 2015 results predominantly from tax expense on earnings in the U.S. and the inability to benefit losses in our foreign subsidiaries due to valuation allowances.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nIn 2016, Ryerson China's results of operations was income partially offset by a loss at our Brazil operations through A\u00e7ofran A\u00e7os e Metais Ltda ( A\u00e7ofran\u201d) in which we had a 50% direct ownership percentage, until we substantially liquidated our investment in Acofran during 2016. The portion of Ryerson China and A\u00e7ofran's results attributable to the noncontrolling interest in 2016 was income of $0.2 million. In 2015, Ryerson China's and A\u00e7ofran's results of operations was a loss. The portion of the income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Ryerson China and A\u00e7ofran was a loss of $1.3 million for 2015.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share was earnings of $0.55 in 2016 and a loss of $0.02 in 2015. Diluted earnings (loss) per share was earnings of $0.54 in 2016 and a loss of $0.02 in 2015. The changes in earnings (loss) per share are due to the results of operations discussed above as well as an increase of 2.2 million in average shares outstanding in 2016 compared to 2015 after the issuance of 5 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering in July 2016.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 with the year ended December 31, 2014\nNet Sales\nNet sales decreased 12.6% to $3.2 billion in 2015 as compared to $3.6 billion in 2014. Average selling price decreased 6.7% while tons sold decreased 6.3% reflecting weaker economic conditions in the metals market in 2015 compared to 2014. The average selling price per ton decreased in 2015 to $1,670 from $1,790 in 2014. Average selling prices per ton decreased for all of our product lines in 2015 with the largest decrease in our stainless steel plate, carbon steel flat and stainless steel flat product lines. Tons sold in 2015 decreased for most of our product lines, with the largest decrease in our carbon steel long, stainless steel long and carbon plate product lines, partially offset by increased tons sold for our aluminum plate product line. Tons sold per ship day were 7,528 in 2015 as compared to 8,032 in 2014.\nCost of Materials Sold\nCost of materials sold decreased 14.2% to $2.6 billion in 2015 compared to $3.0 billion in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton in addition to the decrease in tons sold. The average cost of materials sold per ton decreased to $1,371 in 2015 from $1,497 in 2014. The average cost of materials sold for our stainless steel plate, carbon steel flat and carbon steel plate product lines decreased more than our other products, in line with the change in average selling price per ton.\nDuring 2015, LIFO income was $97 million related to the increase in carbon pricing, partially offset by decreases in pricing in stainless and aluminum. As a result of falling average selling prices, LIFO income in 2015 was partially offset by a $38 million charge\nto record inventory at the lower of cost or market. During 2014, LIFO expense was $42 million related to increases in pricing for all product lines. In 2015, we also recorded a credit to cost of materials sold of $4 million related to the settlement of litigation regarding the price of materials that we were charged.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 17.9% in 2015 compared to 16.4% in 2014 due to, among other things, a decrease in cost of materials sold, as discussed above. Gross profit decreased 4.4% to $567.7 million in 2015 as compared to $593.8 million in 2014.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 14.5% in 2015 from 14.0% in 2014. Operating expenses in 2015 were $459.1 million, a decrease of $48.3 million from $507.4 million in 2014 primarily due to the following reasons:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a $25.0 million charge in 2014 to terminate the advisory service agreement with Platinum Advisors in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on August 13, 2014, which is described in Note 12, Related Parties\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> transaction-related compensation expense of $7.7 million associated with the initial public offering in 2014,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> lower incentive compensation expense of $16.1 million, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> lower delivery expense of $6.9 million due to lower volume.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese changes were partially offset by:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> impairment charges on assets of $7.7 million in 2015, primarily due to fixed asset impairments, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a restructuring charge of $2.5 million in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a per ton basis, operating expenses decreased to $242 per ton in 2015 from $250 per ton in 2014.\nOperating Profit\nAs a result of the factors above, in 2015 we reported an operating profit of $108.6 million, or 3.4% of sales, compared to an operating profit of $86.4 million, or 2.4% of sales, in 2014.\nOther Expenses\nInterest and other expense on debt decreased to $96.3 million in 2015 from $107.4 million in 2014 primarily due to a lower principal amount outstanding of our 9.0% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d) and the 2018 Notes after the redemption of $99.5 million of the 2018 Notes in September of 2014 and the purchases of $30.1 million of the 2018 Notes as well as the purchases of $30.1 million of the 2017 Notes in 2015. Partially offsetting the reduction in debt was a $2.9 million charge in 2015 to write-off a portion of the issuance costs associated with the Company's old revolving credit facility agreement upon entering into a new revolving credit facility agreement. Other income and (expense), net was expense of $10.4 million in 2015 compared to expense of $5.9 million in 2014. The year 2015 net expense is primarily related to a $12.3 million charge due to an other-than-temporary impairment recognized on an available-for-sale investment, partially offset by foreign currency gains of $1.5 million. The year 2014 net expense was primarily related to a $11.2 million loss on the early redemption premium on the redemption of the $99.5 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes, partially offset by $5.3 million of foreign currency gains.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $3.7 million in 2015 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.7 million in 2014. The $3.7 million income tax expense in 2015 results predominantly from tax expense on earnings in the U.S. and the inability to benefit losses in our foreign subsidiaries due to valuation allowances. The $0.7 million income tax benefit in 2014 results from a tax benefit in the U.S. and the impact of certain initial public offering related transactions that are recognized differently for U.S. tax purposes, offset by tax expense in foreign subsidiaries.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nRyerson China's and A\u00e7ofran's results of operations was a loss in 2015 and 2014. The portion of the loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Ryerson China and A\u00e7ofran was $1.3 million for 2015 and $0.5 million for 2014.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share was a loss of $0.02 in 2015 and a loss of $1.01 in 2014. The changes in earnings (loss) per share are due to the results of operations discussed above as well as an increase of 6.7 million in average shares outstanding in 2015 compared to 2014 after the issuance of 11.0 million shares of common stock in an initial public offering on August 8, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under the $750 million revolving credit facility (the Ryerson Credit Facility\u201d) that matures on November 16, 2021. Its principal source of operating cash is from the sale of metals and other materials. Its principal uses of cash are for payments associated with the procurement and processing of metals and other materials inventories, costs incurred for the warehousing and delivery of inventories and the selling and administrative costs of the business, capital expenditures, and for interest payments on debt.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's cash flows:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 259.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (73.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (232.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 of $80.7 million, compared to $63.2 million at December 31, 2015 and $60.0 million at December 31, 2014. The Company had $964 million, $1,024 million and $1,242 million of total debt outstanding, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 105%, 116% and 111% and $225 million, $185 million and $245 million available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company had total liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility, the Old Credit Facility, and foreign debt facilities) of $301 million, $273 million and $328 million at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total liquidity is not a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) financial measure. We believe that total liquidity provides additional information for measuring our ability to fund our operations. Total liquidity does not represent, and should not be used as a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and total liquidity is not necessarily an indication of whether cash flow will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements.\nBelow is a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to total liquidity:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Qualified cash pledged as collateral\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (31\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Availability under Ryerson Credit Facility and foreign debt facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOf the total cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016, $71 million was held in subsidiaries outside the United States which is deemed to be permanently reinvested. Ryerson does not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds from its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Although the Company has historically satisfied needs for more capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances, it could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions which could result in higher effective tax rates. The Company has not\nrecorded a deferred tax liability for the effect of a possible repatriation of these assets as management intends to permanently reinvest these assets outside of the U.S. Specific plans for reinvestment include funding for future international acquisitions and funding of existing international operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $25.4 million and $259.1 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $73.3 million during 2014. Net income (loss) was income of $18.9 million in 2016 and a loss of $1.8 million and $26.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities of $25.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $42.5 million, an increase in accounts payable of $20.5 million and net income of $18.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $22.5 million, pension contributions of $22.1 million and premium and fees related to debt modification of $15.7 million. Cash provided by operating activities of $259.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in inventory of $178.1 million as we reduced inventory as metal prices weakened during the year. In addition, accounts receivable declined $88.0 million reflecting lower average selling prices and tons sold in 2015, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense was $43.7 million and we recorded a non-cash charge of $12.3 million due to an other-than-temporary impairment charge recognized on an available-for-sale investment. Partially offsetting the cash inflows were pension contributions of $42.5 million and lower accrued liabilities of $20.0 million primarily due to a lower accrual for incentive compensation in 2015. Cash used in operating activities of $73.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of pension contributions of $55.4 million, the net loss in 2014 of $26.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $22.4 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $19.5 million reflecting higher sales in 2014, partially offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $45.6 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $20.7 million, $18.0 million and $34.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were $23.0 million, $22.3 million and $21.6 million, respectively. On August 3, 2015, the Company paid $7.7 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Southern Tool Steel, Inc. On December 31, 2014, the Company paid $20.1 million to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Fay Industries, Inc. and the membership interests of Fay Group, Ltd. In 2016 and 2015, the Company paid an additional $1.1 million in each year in deferred consideration owed to the sellers of Fay Industries, Inc. The Company sold property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale generating cash proceeds of $3.2 million, $10.4 million and $7.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to the issuance of the 2022 Notes with a principle amount of $650.0 million, net proceeds of $71.5 million from the issuance of common stock, and net proceeds of $37.0 million from credit facility borrowings, partially offset by the redemption of the $569.9 million outstanding balance of the 2017 Notes and $170.4 million of the 2018 Notes. Net cash used in financing activities was $232.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily related to the purchases of $30.1 million principal amount of the 2017 Notes repurchased for $29.4 million and the purchases of $30.1 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes repurchased for $30.5 million, and $164.4 million of repayments of credit facility borrowings with cash provided by operations discussed above. Net cash used in financing activities was $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, we received $112.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock in an initial public offering and used $110.7 million of the proceeds to redeem $99.5 million principal amount of our 2018 Notes and pay a $11.2 million redemption premium. In addition, credit facility borrowings in 2014 increased $63.8 million primarily to fund cash used in operating activities as well as capital expenditures and book overdrafts increased $36.0 million.\nTotal Debt\nTotal debt at December 31, 2016 decreased $60.0 million to $963.5 million from $1,023.5 million at December 31, 2015 as a result of the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the net cash provided by operating activities.\nTotal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2016 consisted of the following amounts: $312.0 million borrowing under the Ryerson Credit Facility, $650.0 million under the 2022 Notes and $19.2 million of foreign debt, less 17.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. Availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility was $225 million and $185 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Discussion of our outstanding debt follows.\nRyerson Credit Facility\nOn November 16, 2016, Ryerson entered into an amendment with respect to its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement (as amended, the Ryerson Credit Facility\u201d), to reduce the total facility size from $1.0 billion (the Old Credit Facility\u201d) to $750 million, reduce the interest rate on outstanding borrowings by 25 basis points, reduce commitment fees on amounts not borrowed by 2.5 basis points, and to extend the maturity date to November 16, 2021.\nAt December 31, 2016, Ryerson had $312.0 million of outstanding borrowings, $16 million of letters of credit issued and $225 million available under the Ryerson Credit Facility compared to $272.2 million of outstanding borrowings, $17 million of letters of credit issued and $185 million available at December 31, 2015 under the Old Credit Facility. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as Ryerson is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these three amounts, less applicable reserves. Eligible accounts receivable, at any date of determination, is comprised of the aggregate value of all accounts directly created by a borrower (and in the case of Canadian accounts, a Canadian guarantor) in the ordinary course of business arising out of the sale of goods or the rendering of services, each of which has been invoiced, with such receivables adjusted to exclude various ineligible accounts, including, among other things, those to which a borrower (or guarantor, as applicable) does not have sole and absolute title and accounts arising out of a sale to an employee, officer, director, or affiliate of a borrower (or guarantor, as applicable). Eligible inventory, at any date of determination, is comprised of the aggregate value of all inventory owned by a borrower (and in the case of Canadian accounts, a Canadian guarantor), with such inventory adjusted to exclude various ineligible inventory, including, among other things, (i) any inventory that is classified as supplies\u201d or is unsaleable in the ordinary course of business, (ii) 50% of the value of any inventory that (A) has not been sold or processed within a 180 day period and (B) which is calculated to have more than 365 days of supply based upon the immediately preceding 6 months consumption, and (iii) 50% of the value of inventory classified as partial inventory pieces on the basis that the inventory has been cut below sales lengths customary for such inventory. Qualified cash consists of cash in an eligible deposit account that is subject to customary restrictions and liens in favor of the lenders. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility was 2.2 percent and 2.1 percent at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe Ryerson Credit Facility has an allocation of $660 million to the Company's subsidiaries in the United States and an allocation of $90 million to Ryerson Holding's Canadian subsidiary that is a borrower. Amounts outstanding under the Ryerson Credit Facility bear interest at (i) a rate determined by reference to (A) the base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America, N.A.'s prime rate and the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%) or (B) a LIBOR rate or, (ii) for Ryerson Holding's Canadian subsidiary that is a borrower, (A) a rate determined by reference to the Canadian base rate (the greatest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America-Canada Branch's base rate\u201d for commercial loans in U.S. Dollars made at its base rate\u201d and the 30 day LIBOR rate plus 1.00%), (B) the prime rate (the greater of Bank of America-Canada Branch's prime rate\u201d for commercial loans made by it in Canada in Canadian Dollars and the one-month Canadian bankers' acceptance rate plus 1.00%) or (C) the bankers' acceptance rate. The spread over the base rate and prime rate is between 0.25% and 0.50% and the spread over the LIBOR and for the bankers' acceptances is between 1.25% and 1.50%, depending on the amount available to be borrowed under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Overdue amounts and all amounts owed during the existence of a default bear interest at 2% above the rate otherwise applicable thereto. Ryerson also pays commitment fees on amounts not borrowed at a rate of 0.23%.\nBorrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility are secured by first-priority liens on all of the inventory, accounts receivables, lockbox accounts and related assets of the borrowers and the guarantors.\nThe Ryerson Credit Facility also contains covenants that, among other things, restrict Ryerson Holding and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to the incurrence of debt, the creation of liens, transactions with affiliates, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions. The Ryerson Credit Facility also requires that, if availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility declines to a certain level, Ryerson maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and includes defaults upon (among other things) the occurrence of a change of control of Ryerson and a cross-default to other financing arrangements.\nThe Ryerson Credit Facility contains events of default with respect to, among other things, default in the payment of principal when due or the payment of interest, fees and other amounts due thereunder after a specified grace period, material misrepresentations, failure to perform certain specified covenants, certain bankruptcy events, the invalidity of certain security agreements or guarantees, material judgments and the occurrence of a change of control of Ryerson. If such an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Ryerson Credit Facility will be entitled to various remedies, including acceleration of amounts outstanding under the Ryerson Credit Facility and all other actions permitted to be taken by secured creditors.\nThe lenders under the Ryerson Credit Facility have the ability to reject a borrowing request if any event, circumstance or development has occurred that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company. If Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, any of the other borrowers or any restricted subsidiaries of JT Ryerson becomes insolvent or commences bankruptcy proceedings, all amounts borrowed under the Ryerson Credit Facility will become immediately due and payable.\nProceeds from borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility and repayments of borrowings thereunder that are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows represent borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement with original maturities greater than three months. Net proceeds (repayments) under the Ryerson Credit Facility represent borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility with original maturities less than three months.\n2017, 2018 and 2022 Notes\nOn May 24, 2016, JT Ryerson issued $650 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes (the 2022 Notes\u201d). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 11.00% per annum. The 2022 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries that are co-borrowers or that have guarantee obligations under the Ryerson Credit Facility.\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Notes, along with borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, was used to (i) repurchase and/or redeem in full the $569.9 million balance of JT Ryerson's 9.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d), plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the repayment date, (ii) repurchase $95.0 million of JT Ryerson's 11.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes\u201d), and (iii) pay related fees, expenses and premiums.\nThe Company applied the provisions of ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d in accounting for the issuance of the 2022 Notes, redemption of the 2017 Notes and partial repurchase of the 2018 Notes. The evaluation of the accounting under ASC 470-50 was performed on a creditor by creditor basis in order to determine if the terms of the debt were substantially different and, as a result, whether to apply modification or extinguishment accounting. For the lenders where it was determined that the terms of the debt were not substantially different, modification accounting was applied. For the remaining lenders, extinguishment accounting was applied. In connection with this debt modification and extinguishment, the Company recorded a $16.1 million loss within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2016, primarily attributed to the costs incurred with third parties for arrangement fees, legal and other services related to the modified debt, as well as redemption fees paid to the creditors and unamortized debt issuance costs written off related to the extinguished debt. Additionally, the costs incurred with third parties for arrangement fees, legal and other services related to the extinguished debt and redemption fees paid to the creditors related to the modified debt were capitalized and are being amortized over the life of the modified debt using the effective interest method.\nThe 2022 Notes and the related guarantees are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of JT Ryerson's and each guarantor's present and future assets located in the United States (other than receivables, inventory, money, deposit accounts and related general intangibles, certain other assets and proceeds thereof), subject to certain exceptions and customary permitted liens. The 2022 Notes and the related guarantees are also secured on a second-priority basis by a lien on the assets that secure JT Ryerson's and the Company's obligations under the Ryerson Credit Facility.\nThe 2022 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2019 at certain redemption prices. The redemption price for the 2022 Notes if redeemed during the twelve months beginning (i) May 15, 2019 is 105.50%, (ii) May 15, 2020 is 102.75%, and (iii) May 15, 2021 and thereafter is 100.00%. JT Ryerson may redeem some or all of the 2022 Notes before May 15, 2019 at a redemption price of 100.00% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a make-whole\u201d premium. In addition, JT Ryerson may redeem up to 35% of the 2022 Notes before May 15, 2019 with respect to the 2022 Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a price equal to 111.00%, with respect to the 2022 Notes, of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any. JT Ryerson may be required to make an offer to purchase the 2022 Notes upon the sale of assets or upon a change of control.\nThe 2022 Notes contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, our ability, and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock, make investments, sell assets, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations or create liens or use assets as security in other transactions. Subject to certain exceptions, JT Ryerson may only pay dividends to Ryerson Holding to the extent of 50% of future net income, once prior losses are offset.\nAs of December 31, 2016, zero, zero and $650.0 million of the original outstanding principal amount of the 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes remain outstanding, respectively. The Company has repurchased and in the future may repurchase long-term notes in the open market.\nDuring the year 2016, a principal amount of $75.4 million of the 2018 Notes were repurchased for $67.9 million and retired, resulting in the recognition of an $7.4 million gain within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Including the $16.1 million loss on the redemption of the $569.9 million balance of the 2017 Notes and repurchase of $95.0 million of the 2018 Notes, the Company recognized a total net loss of $8.7 million within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during year 2016.\nDuring the year 2015, a principal amount of $30.1 million of the 2017 Notes were repurchased for $29.4 million and retired, resulting in the recognition of a $0.7 million gain within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the year 2015, a principal amount of $30.1 million of the 2018 Notes were repurchased for $30.5 million and\nretired, resulting in the recognition of a $0.4 million loss within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nForeign Debt\nAt December 31, 2016, Ryerson China's total foreign borrowings were $19.2 million, which were owed to banks in Asia at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4% per annum and secured by inventory and property, plant and equipment. At December 31, 2015, Ryerson China's total foreign borrowings were $21.8 million, which were owed to banks in Asia at a weighted average interest rate of 4.3% per annum and secured by inventory and property, plant and equipment. Other foreign borrowings were zero and $0.2 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nAvailability under the Ryerson China's credit facility was $26 million and $23 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Letters of credit issued by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $1 million and $2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nPension Funding\nThe Company made contributions of $22.1 million in 2016, $42.5 million in 2015 and $55.4 million in 2014 to improve the Company's pension plans funded status. At December 31, 2016, as reflected in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, pension liabilities exceeded plan assets by $216 million. The Company anticipates that it will have a minimum required pension contribution of approximately $22 million in 2017 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA\u201d), Pension Protection Act in the U.S and the Ontario Pension Benefits Act in Canada. Future contribution requirements depend on the investment returns on plan assets, the impact of discount rates on pension liabilities, and changes in regulatory requirements. The Company is unable to determine the amount or timing of any such contributions required by ERISA or whether any such contributions would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or cash flows. The Company believes that cash flow from operations and the Ryerson Credit Facility described above will provide sufficient funds to make the minimum required contribution in 2017.\nIncome Tax Payments\nThe Company made income tax payments of $1.8 million, $3.2 million and $1.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit, which totaled $17 million as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, other than normal course long-term operating leases included in the following Contractual Obligations table, we do not have any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements. None of these off-balance sheet arrangements are likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents contractual obligations at December 31, 2016:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 - 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ryerson Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on 2022 Notes, Foreign Debt and\nRyerson Credit Facility(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension Withdrawal Liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The contractual obligations disclosed above do not include our potential future pension funding obligations (see previous discussion under Pension Funding\u201d caption).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, we do not know the timing of when our obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits will occur, if at all.

Capital expenditures were primarily for machinery and equipment.\nThe Company anticipates capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, to be approximately $25 million in 2017. The spending includes maintenance expenditures and improvements to maintain, upgrade, and add to the Company's North American processing capabilities.\nRestructuring\nIn 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $1.0 million related to a facility closure, which consists of tenancy-related costs, primarily future lease payments. The Company paid $0.2 million in costs related to this facility closure and also reclassified an existing $0.2 million liability for future lease payments at this facility to the restructuring reserve. The Company also paid $0.3 million in costs related to a facility closed in 2013 and recorded an addition of $0.1 million to the reserve for tenancy-related costs, which was charged to warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining $1.3 million of tenancy-related costs are expected to be paid through 2025.\nDuring 2016, the Company paid $0.7 million in employee-related costs related to restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company also recorded a $0.3 million reduction to the reserve for employee-related costs and credited warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining $0.2 million of employee-related costs are expected to be paid in 2017.\nIn 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $2.2 million for employee costs related to expense reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. The charge consists primarily of severance costs for 140 employees in addition to $0.2 million of non-cash pensions and other post-retirement benefit costs. During 2015, the Company paid $0.8 million in costs related to this expense reduction initiative.\nIn 2015, the Company also recorded a $0.3 million charge to increase the reserve for tenancy-related costs for a facility closed in 2013. During 2015, the Company paid $0.4 million in tenancy costs related to this facility.\nIn 2014, the Company paid $0.7 million in tenancy costs related to a facility closed in 2013. In 2014, the Company also recorded a $0.1 million reduction to the reserve for tenancy-related costs and credited warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2014, the Company also paid the remaining $0.1 million of employee costs related to the closure of this facility.\nDeferred Tax Amounts\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of $21 million comprised primarily of a deferred tax asset of $85 million related to pension liabilities, a deferred tax asset related to postretirement benefits other than pensions of $28 million, $30 million of Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) credit carryforwards and deferred tax assets of $96 million related to federal, local and foreign tax loss carryforwards, offset by a valuation allowance of $20 million and deferred tax liabilities of $81 million related to fixed assets and $129 million related to inventory.\nThe Company's deferred tax assets include $76 million related to U.S. federal net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards, $12 million related to state NOL carryforwards and $8 million related to foreign NOL carryforwards, available at December 31, 2016.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d the Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The Company records a valuation allowance when, based upon the evaluation of all available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we analyze, among other things, our recent history of earnings, the nature and timing of reversing book-tax temporary differences, tax planning strategies and future income. After considering both the positive and negative evidence available, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company determined that it was more-likely-than-not that it would not realize a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company established a valuation allowance against a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company released a portion of the valuation allowance related to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, JT Ryerson, during 2012. The Company released most of the remaining U.S. related valuation allowance during 2013. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a valuation allowance of $22.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a valuation allowance of $20.0 million, a decrease of $2.6 million from the prior year mainly related to changes in foreign deferred tax assets.\nAs described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company assesses the need for a valuation allowance considering all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The fourth quarter of 2013 was the first quarter in which the Company's overall U.S.\noperations had sustained an operating profit in both the preceding cumulative three fiscal year period and in each of its two preceding fiscal years, providing objective evidence of the Company's ability to earn future profits. Combined with the Company's projections of future income providing additional subjective evidence of the Company's ability to earn future profits and management's judgment, the Company determined that these deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable and accordingly the valuation allowance was no longer required.\nThe Company will continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets until such time as in management's judgment, considering all available positive and negative evidence, the Company determines that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nPreparation of this Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are disclosed in Item 8 within Note 1: Summary of Accounting and Financial Policies. These policies have been consistently applied and address such matters as revenue recognition, depreciation methods, inventory valuation, asset impairment recognition and pension and postretirement expense. While policies associated with estimates and judgments may be affected by different assumptions or conditions, we believe our estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nWe consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements, as application of these policies places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation of matters that are uncertain.\nProvision for allowances, claims and doubtful accounts: We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers and set credit limits based upon review of the customers' current credit information and payment history. We monitor customer payments and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Estimation of such losses requires adjusting historical loss experience for current economic conditions and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers. We cannot guarantee that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience. Provisions for allowances and claims are based upon historical rates, expected trends and estimates of potential returns, allowances, customer discounts and incentives. We consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of the provision for allowances, claims and doubtful accounts.\nInventory valuation: Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market could be subject to certain estimates; however the measurement is primarily based on historical purchasing and sales information rather than forecasted metals pricing. Inventory costs reflect metal and in-bound freight purchase costs, third-party processing costs and internal direct and allocated indirect processing costs. Cost is primarily determined by the LIFO method. We regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow-moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends. Changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory.\nIncome Taxes: Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserve for uncertain tax positions reflect our best estimate of taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. The determination of the consolidated income tax expense requires judgment and estimation by management. It is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates that management has used to determine its consolidated income tax expense.\nWe record operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and the estimated effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We follow detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction when reviewing tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide for valuation allowances as required. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on historical taxable income, the expected reversals of existing temporary differences, tax planning strategies and on forecasts of future taxable income. The forecasts of future taxable income require assumptions regarding volume, selling prices, margins, expense levels and industry cyclicality. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets related to those jurisdictions.\nThe Company's income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax\nand interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken. For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a more likely than not\u201d threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Company's ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company's effective tax rate.\nLong-lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets: Long-lived assets held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment is recognized. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset's residual value, if any. Any related impairment loss is calculated based upon comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the asset. Separate intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. An impaired long-lived or intangible asset would be written down to fair value, based on various available valuation techniques, including the discounted cash flow method.\nGoodwill: We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of recorded goodwill annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever indicators of potential impairment exist. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to developments in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method, as necessary. Factors that may be considered indicators of impairment include: deterioration in general economic conditions; declines in the market conditions of our products, including metals prices; a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; reduced future cash flow estimates; and slower growth rates in our industry, among others. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value based on our qualitative assessment, we will proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. In step one, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair value of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. An income approach based on discounted future cash flows requires us to estimate income from operations based on projected results and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. A market approach estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures of comparable public companies. If these estimates or their related assumptions for commodity prices and demand change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.\nBased on the impairment test performed in the prior year on October 1, 2015, the reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 25%. Based on a qualitative assessment performed on October 1, 2016, the Company concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. Therefore, we did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test during 2016. The discount rate for the reporting unit was estimated to be 14.0% at October 1, 2016. The Company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable risk-adjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit. Deterioration in market conditions in our industry or products, changes in expected future cash flows, expected growth rates or to discount rates could result in impairment charges in future periods.\nPurchase Price Accounting: Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the Company to record assets and liabilities of the business acquired at their estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The Company uses valuation specialists, where necessary, to perform appraisals and assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require management to make estimates and assumptions that are critical in determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\nPension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions: We sponsor various benefit plans covering a portion of our employees for pension and postretirement medical costs. Statistical methods are used to anticipate future events when calculating expenses and liabilities related to the plans. The statistical methods include assumptions about, among other things, the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of increase of health care costs and the rate of future compensation increases. Our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates when estimating expenses and liabilities. The discount rate used for U.S. plans reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on our annual measurement date (December 31) and is subject to change each year. The discount rate was determined by matching, on an approximate basis, the coupons and maturities for a\nportfolio of corporate bonds (rated Aa or better by Moody's Investor Services or AA or better by Standard and Poor's) to the expected plan benefit payments defined by the projected benefit obligation. The discount rates used for plans outside the U.S. are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities, the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment.\nWhen calculating pension expense for 2016, we assumed the pension plans' assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 7.10% for the U.S. plan, and between 5.50% and 5.75% for the Canadian plans. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans' assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. Our projected long-term rate of return for the U.S. pension plan is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans' assets, and is supported by the historical returns on our plans' assets. The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans' investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased 2016 pension expense by approximately $3 million.\nFuture pension obligations for the U.S. plans were discounted using a rate of 4.14% at December 31, 2016. Future pension obligations for the Canadian plans were discounted using weighted average rates between 3.64% and 3.71% at December 31, 2016. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase the pension liability at December 31, 2016 by approximately $45 million.\nThe calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. A one percentage point increase (decrease) in assumed health care trend rates would increase (decrease) our total service and interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2016 by $0.2 million and $(0.1) million, respectively. A decrease in the weighted average discount rate of 50 basis points would increase the postretirement benefit liability by approximately $3 million.\nThe assumptions used in the actuarial calculation of expenses and liabilities may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension or postretirement benefit expense we may record in the future.\nLegal contingencies: We are involved in a number of legal and regulatory matters including those discussed in Note 12 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our legal matters based on available information to assess potential liability. We consult with outside counsel involved in our legal matters when analyzing potential outcomes. We cannot determine at this time whether any potential liability related to this litigation would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent accounting pronouncements are discussed within Note 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Interest and other expense on debt decreased to $89.9 million in 2016 from $96.3 million in 2015 primarily due to a lower principal amount of debt outstanding in 2016, partially offset by an increase in the interest rate on a portion of our outstanding Notes after we redeemed the $569.9 million outstanding balance our 9.0% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d), redeemed the $170.4 million outstanding balance of our 11.25% Senior Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes\u201d) and issued $650.0 million of new 11.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) in 2016. The year 2015 also included a $2.9 million charge to write-off a portion of the issuance costs associated with the Company's old revolving credit facility agreement upon entering into a new revolving credit facility agreement. Other income and (expense), net was expense of $17.2 million in 2016 compared to expense of $10.4 million in 2015. The year 2016 net expense is primarily related to a $8.7 million net loss on debt redemptions, a $4.7 million charge due to an other-than-temporary impairment recognized on an available-for-sale investment and foreign currency losses of $3.9 million. The year 2015 net expense primarily related to a $12.3 million charge due to an other-than-temporary impairment recognized on an available-for-sale investment, partially offset by foreign currency gains of $1.5 million.\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year

borrowings, $16 million of letters of credit issued and $225 million available under the Ryerson Credit Facility compared to $272.2 million of outstanding borrowings, $17 million of letters of credit issued and $185 million available at December 31, 2015 under the Old Credit Facility. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as Ryerson is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these three amounts, less applicable reserves. Eligible accounts receivable, at any date of determination, is comprised of the aggregate value of all accounts directly created by a borrower (and in the case of Canadian accounts, a Canadian guarantor) in the ordinary course of business arising out of the sale of goods or the rendering of services, each of which has been invoiced, with such receivables adjusted to exclude various ineligible accounts, including, among other things, those to which a borrower (or guarantor, as applicable) does not have sole and absolute title and accounts arising out of a sale to an employee, officer, director, or affiliate of a borrower (or guarantor, as applicable). Eligible inventory, at any date of determination, is comprised of the aggregate value of all inventory owned by a borrower (and in the case of Canadian accounts, a Canadian guarantor), with such inventory adjusted to exclude various ineligible inventory, including, among other things, (i) any inventory that is classified as supplies\u201d or is unsaleable in the ordinary course of business, (ii) 50% of the value of any inventory that (A) has not been sold or processed within a 180 day period and (B) which is calculated to have more than 365 days of supply based upon the immediately preceding 6 months consumption, and (iii) 50% of the value of inventory classified as partial inventory pieces on the basis that the inventory has been cut below sales lengths customary for such inventory. Qualified cash consists of cash in an eligible deposit account that is subject to customary restrictions and liens in favor of the lenders. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility was 2.2 percent and 2.1 percent at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\noperations had sustained an operating profit in both the preceding cumulative three fiscal year period and in each of its two preceding fiscal years, providing objective evidence of the Company's ability to earn future profits. Combined with the Company's projections of future income providing additional subjective evidence of the Company's ability to earn future profits and management's judgment, the Company determined that these deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable and accordingly the valuation allowance was no longer required.\nWhen calculating pension expense for 2016, we assumed the pension plans' assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 7.10% for the U.S. plan, and between 5.50% and 5.75% for the Canadian plans. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans' assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. Our projected long-term rate of return for the U.S. pension plan is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans' assets, and is supported by the historical returns on our plans' assets. The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans' investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased 2016 pension expense by approximately $3 million.\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $7.2 million in 2016 compared to an income tax expense of $3.7 million in 2015. The $7.2 million income tax expense in 2016 results predominantly from tax expense on earnings in the U.S. and the inability to benefit losses in our foreign subsidiaries due to valuation allowances. The $3.7 million income tax expense in 2015 results predominantly from tax expense on earnings in the U.S. and the inability to benefit losses in our foreign subsidiaries due to valuation allowances.\nThe Company applied the provisions of ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d in accounting for the issuance of the 2022 Notes, redemption of the 2017 Notes and partial repurchase of the 2018 Notes. The evaluation of the accounting under ASC 470-50 was performed on a creditor by creditor basis in order to determine if the terms of the debt were substantially different and, as a result, whether to apply modification or extinguishment accounting. For the lenders where it was determined that the terms of the debt were not substantially different, modification accounting was applied. For the remaining lenders, extinguishment accounting was applied. In connection with this debt modification and extinguishment, the Company recorded a $16.1 million loss within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2016, primarily attributed to the costs incurred with third parties for arrangement fees, legal and other services related to the modified debt, as well as redemption fees paid to the creditors and unamortized debt issuance costs written off related to the extinguished debt. Additionally, the costs incurred with third parties for arrangement fees, legal and other services related to the extinguished debt and redemption fees paid to the creditors related to the modified debt were capitalized and are being amortized over the life of the modified debt using the effective interest method.\n \u2022 lower delivery expense of $6.9 million due to lower volume. \nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Qualified cash pledged as collateral\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (31\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Availability under Ryerson Credit Facility and foreign debt facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 259.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (73.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (232.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company assesses the need for a valuation allowance considering all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies.

These differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension or postretirement benefit expense we may record in the future.\nDuring 2015, LIFO income was $97 million related to the increase in carbon pricing, partially offset by decreases in pricing in stainless and aluminum. As a result of falling average selling prices, LIFO income in 2015 was partially offset by a $38 million charge\nThe Ryerson Credit Facility has an allocation of $660 million to the Company's subsidiaries in the United States and an allocation of $90 million to Ryerson Holding's Canadian subsidiary that is a borrower. Amounts outstanding under the Ryerson Credit Facility bear interest at (i) a rate determined by reference to (A) the base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America, N.A.'s prime rate and the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%) or (B) a LIBOR rate or, (ii) for Ryerson Holding's Canadian subsidiary that is a borrower, (A) a rate determined by reference to the Canadian base rate (the greatest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America-Canada Branch's base rate\u201d for commercial loans in U.S. Dollars made at its base rate\u201d and the 30 day LIBOR rate plus 1.00%), (B) the prime rate (the greater of Bank of America-Canada Branch's prime rate\u201d for commercial loans made by it in Canada in Canadian Dollars and the one-month Canadian bankers' acceptance rate plus 1.00%) or (C) the bankers' acceptance rate. The spread over the base rate and prime rate is between 0.25% and 0.50% and the spread over the LIBOR and for the bankers' acceptances is between 1.25% and 1.50%, depending on the amount available to be borrowed under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Overdue amounts and all amounts owed during the existence of a default bear interest at 2% above the rate otherwise applicable thereto. Ryerson also pays commitment fees on amounts not borrowed at a rate of 0.23%.\nFuture pension obligations for the U.S. plans were discounted using a rate of 4.14% at December 31, 2016. Future pension obligations for the Canadian plans were discounted using weighted average rates between 3.64% and 3.71% at December 31, 2016. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase the pension liability at December 31, 2016 by approximately $45 million.\n\nThe 2022 Notes and the related guarantees are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of JT Ryerson's and each guarantor's present and future assets located in the United States (other than receivables, inventory, money, deposit accounts and related general intangibles, certain other assets and proceeds thereof), subject to certain exceptions and customary permitted liens. The 2022 Notes and the related guarantees are also secured on a second-priority basis by a lien on the assets that secure JT Ryerson's and the Company's obligations under the Ryerson Credit Facility.\nDeferred Tax Amounts\nNoncontrolling Interest\nand interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken. For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a more likely than not\u201d threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Company's ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company's effective tax rate.\nNet Sales\nAvailability under the Ryerson China's credit facility was $26 million and $23 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Letters of credit issued by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $1 million and $2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nCapital Expenditures\n\nOn May 24, 2016, JT Ryerson issued $650 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes (the 2022 Notes\u201d). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 11.00% per annum. The 2022 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries that are co-borrowers or that have guarantee obligations under the Ryerson Credit Facility.\nIn 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $1.0 million related to a facility closure, which consists of tenancy-related costs, primarily future lease payments. The Company paid $0.2 million in costs related to this facility closure and also reclassified an existing $0.2 million liability for future lease payments at this facility to the restructuring reserve. The Company also paid $0.3 million in costs related to a facility closed in 2013 and recorded an addition of $0.1 million to the reserve for tenancy-related costs, which was charged to warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining $1.3 million of tenancy-related costs are expected to be paid through 2025.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Ryerson Credit Facility also contains covenants that, among other things, restrict Ryerson Holding and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to the incurrence of debt, the creation of liens, transactions with affiliates, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions. The Ryerson Credit Facility also requires that, if availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility declines to a certain level, Ryerson maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and includes defaults upon (among other things) the occurrence of a change of control of Ryerson and a cross-default to other financing arrangements.\n (4) The purchase obligations with suppliers are entered into when we receive firm sales commitments with certain of our customers. \nDuring 2016, LIFO expense was $7 million related to increases in pricing for carbon products. During 2015, LIFO income was $97 million related to decreases in pricing for all product lines. As a result of falling average selling prices, LIFO income in 2015 was partially offset by a $38 million charge to record inventory at the lower of cost or market. In 2016, we recorded income of $14 million to adjust the lower of cost or market inventory reserve.\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 a restructuring charge of $2.5 million in 2015. \nOverview\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of our metals products. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of product to customers. The timing of shipment is substantially the same as the timing of delivery to customers given the proximity of our distribution sites to our customers.\nBasic earnings (loss) per share was earnings of $0.55 in 2016 and a loss of $0.02 in 2015. Diluted earnings (loss) per share was earnings of $0.54 in 2016 and a loss of $0.02 in 2015. The changes in earnings (loss) per share are due to the results of operations discussed above as well as an increase of 2.2 million in average shares outstanding in 2016 compared to 2015 after the issuance of 5 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering in July 2016.\nWe record operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and the estimated effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We follow detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction when reviewing tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide for valuation allowances as required. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on historical taxable income, the expected reversals of existing temporary differences, tax planning strategies and on forecasts of future taxable income. The forecasts of future taxable income require assumptions regarding volume, selling prices, margins, expense levels and industry cyclicality. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets related to those jurisdictions.\nThe Company made contributions of $22.1 million in 2016, $42.5 million in 2015 and $55.4 million in 2014 to improve the Company's pension plans funded status. At December 31, 2016, as reflected in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, pension liabilities exceeded plan assets by $216 million. The Company anticipates that it will have a minimum required pension contribution of approximately $22 million in 2017 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA\u201d), Pension Protection Act in the U.S and the Ontario Pension Benefits Act in Canada. Future contribution requirements depend on the investment returns on plan assets, the impact of discount rates on pension liabilities, and changes in regulatory requirements. The Company is unable to determine the amount or timing of any such contributions required by ERISA or whether any such contributions would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or cash flows. The Company believes that cash flow from operations and the Ryerson Credit Facility described above will provide sufficient funds to make the minimum required contribution in 2017.\nPension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions: We sponsor various benefit plans covering a portion of our employees for pension and postretirement medical costs. Statistical methods are used to anticipate future events when calculating expenses and liabilities related to the plans. The statistical methods include assumptions about, among other things, the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of increase of health care costs and the rate of future compensation increases. Our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates when estimating expenses and liabilities. The discount rate used for U.S. plans reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on our annual measurement date (December 31) and is subject to change each year. The discount rate was determined by matching, on an approximate basis, the coupons and maturities for a\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company's deferred tax assets include $76 million related to U.S. federal net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards, $12 million related to state NOL carryforwards and $8 million related to foreign NOL carryforwards, available at December 31, 2016.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 20.0% in 2016 compared to 17.9% in 2015 due to, among other things, a decrease in cost of materials sold, as discussed above. Gross profit increased 0.5% to $570.6 million in 2016 as compared to $567.7 million in 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe 2022 Notes contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, our ability, and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock, make investments, sell assets, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations or create liens or use assets as security in other transactions. Subject to certain exceptions, JT Ryerson may only pay dividends to Ryerson Holding to the extent of 50% of future net income, once prior losses are offset.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 with the year ended December 31, 2015\nProvision for allowances, claims and doubtful accounts: We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers and set credit limits based upon review of the customers' current credit information and payment history. We monitor customer payments and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Estimation of such losses requires adjusting historical loss experience for current economic conditions and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers. We cannot guarantee that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience. Provisions for allowances and claims are based upon historical rates, expected trends and estimates of potential returns, allowances, customer discounts and incentives. We consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of the provision for allowances, claims and doubtful accounts.\nIn 2015, the Company also recorded a $0.3 million charge to increase the reserve for tenancy-related costs for a facility closed in 2013. During 2015, the Company paid $0.4 million in tenancy costs related to this facility.\nLegal contingencies: We are involved in a number of legal and regulatory matters including those discussed in Note 12 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our legal matters based on available information to assess potential liability. We consult with outside counsel involved in our legal matters when analyzing potential outcomes. We cannot determine at this time whether any potential liability related to this litigation would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company anticipates capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, to be approximately $25 million in 2017. The spending includes maintenance expenditures and improvements to maintain, upgrade, and add to the Company's North American processing capabilities.\nIncome Tax Payments\nIncome Taxes: Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserve for uncertain tax positions reflect our best estimate of taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. The determination of the consolidated income tax expense requires judgment and estimation by management. It is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates that management has used to determine its consolidated income tax expense.\n \u2022 a $25.0 million charge in 2014 to terminate the advisory service agreement with Platinum Advisors in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on August 13, 2014, which is described in Note 12, Related Parties\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, \nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Notes, along with borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, was used to (i) repurchase and/or redeem in full the $569.9 million balance of JT Ryerson's 9.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d), plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the repayment date, (ii) repurchase $95.0 million of JT Ryerson's 11.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes\u201d), and (iii) pay related fees, expenses and premiums.\nAt December 31, 2016, Ryerson China's total foreign borrowings were $19.2 million, which were owed to banks in Asia at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4% per annum and secured by inventory and property, plant and equipment. At December 31, 2015, Ryerson China's total foreign borrowings were $21.8 million, which were owed to banks in Asia at a weighted average interest rate of 4.3% per annum and secured by inventory and property, plant and equipment. Other foreign borrowings were zero and $0.2 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to the issuance of the 2022 Notes with a principle amount of $650.0 million, net proceeds of $71.5 million from the issuance of common stock, and net proceeds of $37.0 million from credit facility borrowings, partially offset by the redemption of the $569.9 million outstanding balance of the 2017 Notes and $170.4 million of the 2018 Notes. Net cash used in financing activities was $232.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily related to the purchases of $30.1 million principal amount of the 2017 Notes repurchased for $29.4 million and the purchases of $30.1 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes repurchased for $30.5 million, and $164.4 million of repayments of credit facility borrowings with cash provided by operations discussed above. Net cash used in financing activities was $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, we received $112.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock in an initial public offering and used $110.7 million of the proceeds to redeem $99.5 million principal amount of our 2018 Notes and pay a $11.2 million redemption premium. In addition, credit facility borrowings in 2014 increased $63.8 million primarily to fund cash used in operating activities as well as capital expenditures and book overdrafts increased $36.0 million.\nAs a result of the factors above, in 2015 we reported an operating profit of $108.6 million, or 3.4% of sales, compared to an operating profit of $86.4 million, or 2.4% of sales, in 2014.\nRyerson Credit Facility\n</table>\nCost of materials sold. Cost of materials sold includes metal purchase and in-bound freight costs, third-party processing costs and direct and indirect internal processing costs. The cost of materials sold fluctuates with our sales volume and our ability to purchase metals at competitive prices. Increases in sales volume generally enable us both to improve purchasing leverage with suppliers, as we buy larger quantities of metals inventories, and to reduce operating expenses per ton sold.\nRyerson China's and A\u00e7ofran's results of operations was a loss in 2015 and 2014. The portion of the loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Ryerson China and A\u00e7ofran was $1.3 million for 2015 and $0.5 million for 2014.\nThese changes were partially offset by:\nNet Sales. Our sales volume and pricing is driven by market demand, which is largely determined by overall industrial production and conditions in specific industries in which our customers operate. Sales prices are also primarily driven by market factors such as overall demand and availability of product. Our net sales include revenue from product sales, net of returns, allowances, customer discounts and incentives.\nretired, resulting in the recognition of a $0.4 million loss within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRyerson Holding Corporation ( Ryerson Holding\u201d), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. ( JT Ryerson\u201d), a Delaware corporation. On December 17, 2014, Ryerson Inc., formerly a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, merged with and into JT Ryerson, which was previously an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, with JT Ryerson as the surviving corporation. As a result of such merger, from and after December 17, 2014, JT Ryerson has been a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC ( Platinum\u201d) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding common stock.\nBusiness\nGoodwill: We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of recorded goodwill annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever indicators of potential impairment exist. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to developments in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method, as necessary. Factors that may be considered indicators of impairment include: deterioration in general economic conditions; declines in the market conditions of our products, including metals prices; a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; reduced future cash flow estimates; and slower growth rates in our industry, among others. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value based on our qualitative assessment, we will proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. In step one, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair value of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. An income approach based on discounted future cash flows requires us to estimate income from operations based on projected results and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. A market approach estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures of comparable public companies. If these estimates or their related assumptions for commodity prices and demand change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 lower salaries and wages of $6.3 million due to lower employee headcount, \nCost of materials sold decreased 11.9% to $2.3 billion in 2016 compared to $2.6 billion in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton. The average cost of materials sold per ton decreased to $1,203 in 2016 from $1,371 in 2015. The average cost of materials sold for our stainless steel plate, stainless steel flat and carbon steel plate product lines decreased more than our other products, in line with the change in average selling price per ton.\n (1) The contractual obligations disclosed above do not include our potential future pension funding obligations (see previous discussion under Pension Funding\u201d caption). \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $25.4 million and $259.1 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $73.3 million during 2014. Net income (loss) was income of $18.9 million in 2016 and a loss of $1.8 million and $26.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities of $25.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $42.5 million, an increase in accounts payable of $20.5 million and net income of $18.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $22.5 million, pension contributions of $22.1 million and premium and fees related to debt modification of $15.7 million. Cash provided by operating activities of $259.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in inventory of $178.1 million as we reduced inventory as metal prices weakened during the year. In addition, accounts receivable declined $88.0 million reflecting lower average selling prices and tons sold in 2015, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense was $43.7 million and we recorded a non-cash charge of $12.3 million due to an other-than-temporary impairment charge recognized on an available-for-sale investment. Partially offsetting the cash inflows were pension contributions of $42.5 million and lower accrued liabilities of $20.0 million primarily due to a lower accrual for incentive compensation in 2015. Cash used in operating activities of $73.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of pension contributions of $55.4 million, the net loss in 2014 of $26.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $22.4 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $19.5 million reflecting higher sales in 2014, partially offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $45.6 million.\nThe 2022 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2019 at certain redemption prices. The redemption price for the 2022 Notes if redeemed during the twelve months beginning (i) May 15, 2019 is 105.50%, (ii) May 15, 2020 is 102.75%, and (iii) May 15, 2021 and thereafter is 100.00%. JT Ryerson may redeem some or all of the 2022 Notes before May 15, 2019 at a redemption price of 100.00% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a make-whole\u201d premium. In addition, JT Ryerson may redeem up to 35% of the 2022 Notes before May 15, 2019 with respect to the 2022 Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a price equal to 111.00%, with respect to the 2022 Notes, of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any. JT Ryerson may be required to make an offer to purchase the 2022 Notes upon the sale of assets or upon a change of control.\nSales, cost of materials sold, gross profit and operating expense control are the principal factors that impact our profitability:\n \u2022 Lower employee benefit costs of $11.0 million resulting mainly from a reduction in the net periodic benefit cost for pensions, \nDuring the year 2015, a principal amount of $30.1 million of the 2017 Notes were repurchased for $29.4 million and retired, resulting in the recognition of a $0.7 million gain within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the year 2015, a principal amount of $30.1 million of the 2018 Notes were repurchased for $30.5 million and\nThe following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data:\nIndustry and Operating Trends\nPurchase Price Accounting: Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the Company to record assets and liabilities of the business acquired at their estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The Company uses valuation specialists, where necessary, to perform appraisals and assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require management to make estimates and assumptions that are critical in determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\nOperating expenses. Optimizing business processes and asset utilization to lower fixed expenses such as employee, facility and truck fleet costs which cannot be rapidly reduced in times of declining volume, and maintaining low fixed cost structure in times of increasing sales volume, have a significant impact on our profitability. Operating expenses include costs related to warehousing and distributing our products as well as selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of $21 million comprised primarily of a deferred tax asset of $85 million related to pension liabilities, a deferred tax asset related to postretirement benefits other than pensions of $28 million, $30 million of Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) credit carryforwards and deferred tax assets of $96 million related to federal, local and foreign tax loss carryforwards, offset by a valuation allowance of $20 million and deferred tax liabilities of $81 million related to fixed assets and $129 million related to inventory.\nportfolio of corporate bonds (rated Aa or better by Moody's Investor Services or AA or better by Standard and Poor's) to the expected plan benefit payments defined by the projected benefit obligation. The discount rates used for plans outside the U.S. are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities, the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment.\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 of $80.7 million, compared to $63.2 million at December 31, 2015 and $60.0 million at December 31, 2014. The Company had $964 million, $1,024 million and $1,242 million of total debt outstanding, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 105%, 116% and 111% and $225 million, $185 million and $245 million available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company had total liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility, the Old Credit Facility, and foreign debt facilities) of $301 million, $273 million and $328 million at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total liquidity is not a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) financial measure. We believe that total liquidity provides additional information for measuring our ability to fund our operations. Total liquidity does not represent, and should not be used as a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and total liquidity is not necessarily an indication of whether cash flow will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements.\nTotal Debt\nBased on the impairment test performed in the prior year on October 1, 2015, the reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 25%. Based on a qualitative assessment performed on October 1, 2016, the Company concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. Therefore, we did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test during 2016. The discount rate for the reporting unit was estimated to be 14.0% at October 1, 2016. The Company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable risk-adjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit. Deterioration in market conditions in our industry or products, changes in expected future cash flows, expected growth rates or to discount rates could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n \u2022 transaction-related compensation expense of $7.7 million associated with the initial public offering in 2014, \n2017, 2018 and 2022 Notes\nGross Profit\nThese changes were partially offset by:\n \u2022 an impairment charge on assets of $7.7 million in 2015, primarily due to fixed asset impairments, \nOperating Profit\n \u2022 higher incentive compensation expense of $14.8 million. \nCost of Materials Sold\n \u2022 lower facility expenses, primarily taxes and repair and maintenance costs, of $6.2 million, and \nRecent accounting pronouncements are discussed within Note 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 with the year ended December 31, 2014\nSimilar to other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. At the request of our customers, we have entered into swaps in order to mitigate our customers' risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors' responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers.\nOn a per ton basis, operating expenses decreased to $242 per ton in 2015 from $250 per ton in 2014.\nOf the total cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016, $71 million was held in subsidiaries outside the United States which is deemed to be permanently reinvested. Ryerson does not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds from its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Although the Company has historically satisfied needs for more capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances, it could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions which could result in higher effective tax rates. The Company has not\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under the $750 million revolving credit facility (the Ryerson Credit Facility\u201d) that matures on November 16, 2021. Its principal source of operating cash is from the sale of metals and other materials. Its principal uses of cash are for payments associated with the procurement and processing of metals and other materials inventories, costs incurred for the warehousing and delivery of inventories and the selling and administrative costs of the business, capital expenditures, and for interest payments on debt.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2016 decreased $60.0 million to $963.5 million from $1,023.5 million at December 31, 2015 as a result of the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the net cash provided by operating activities.\nBorrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility are secured by first-priority liens on all of the inventory, accounts receivables, lockbox accounts and related assets of the borrowers and the guarantors.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Ryerson Holding Corporation and Subsidiaries and the Notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the section entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nIn 2014, the Company paid $0.7 million in tenancy costs related to a facility closed in 2013. In 2014, the Company also recorded a $0.1 million reduction to the reserve for tenancy-related costs and credited warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2014, the Company also paid the remaining $0.1 million of employee costs related to the closure of this facility.\nWe purchase large quantities of metal products from primary producers and sell these materials in smaller quantities to a wide variety of metals-consuming industries. More than 75% of the metals products sold are processed by us by burning, sawing, slitting, blanking, cutting to length or other techniques. We sell our products and services to many industries, including commercial ground transportation manufacturing, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable production, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing and oil & gas. In 2016, food processing and agricultural equipment, consumer durable and construction industries grew volumes compared to 2015, offset by declines in oil & gas, HVAC and ground transportation industries. The other two general industrial sectors of our business, metal fabricators and industrial machinery and equipment, showed a slight net gain in volume.\n \u2022 lower incentive compensation expense of $16.1 million, and \nto record inventory at the lower of cost or market. During 2014, LIFO expense was $42 million related to increases in pricing for all product lines. In 2015, we also recorded a credit to cost of materials sold of $4 million related to the settlement of litigation regarding the price of materials that we were charged.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d the Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The Company records a valuation allowance when, based upon the evaluation of all available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we analyze, among other things, our recent history of earnings, the nature and timing of reversing book-tax temporary differences, tax planning strategies and future income. After considering both the positive and negative evidence available, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company determined that it was more-likely-than-not that it would not realize a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company established a valuation allowance against a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company released a portion of the valuation allowance related to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, JT Ryerson, during 2012. The Company released most of the remaining U.S. related valuation allowance during 2013. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a valuation allowance of $22.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a valuation allowance of $20.0 million, a decrease of $2.6 million from the prior year mainly related to changes in foreign deferred tax assets.\nThe Company's income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax\nCapital expenditures during 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $23.0 million, $22.3 million and $21.6 million, respectively. Capital expenditures were primarily for machinery and equipment.\nIn 2016, Ryerson China's results of operations was income partially offset by a loss at our Brazil operations through A\u00e7ofran A\u00e7os e Metais Ltda ( A\u00e7ofran\u201d) in which we had a 50% direct ownership percentage, until we substantially liquidated our investment in Acofran during 2016. The portion of Ryerson China and A\u00e7ofran's results attributable to the noncontrolling interest in 2016 was income of $0.2 million. In 2015, Ryerson China's and A\u00e7ofran's results of operations was a loss. The portion of the income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Ryerson China and A\u00e7ofran was a loss of $1.3 million for 2015.\n\nGross Profit\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit, which totaled $17 million as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, other than normal course long-term operating leases included in the following Contractual Obligations table, we do not have any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements. None of these off-balance sheet arrangements are likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nProceeds from borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility and repayments of borrowings thereunder that are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows represent borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement with original maturities greater than three months. Net proceeds (repayments) under the Ryerson Credit Facility represent borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility with original maturities less than three months.\nForeign Debt\nNet sales decreased 12.6% to $3.2 billion in 2015 as compared to $3.6 billion in 2014. Average selling price decreased 6.7% while tons sold decreased 6.3% reflecting weaker economic conditions in the metals market in 2015 compared to 2014. The average selling price per ton decreased in 2015 to $1,670 from $1,790 in 2014. Average selling prices per ton decreased for all of our product lines in 2015 with the largest decrease in our stainless steel plate, carbon steel flat and stainless steel flat product lines. Tons sold in 2015 decreased for most of our product lines, with the largest decrease in our carbon steel long, stainless steel long and carbon plate product lines, partially offset by increased tons sold for our aluminum plate product line. Tons sold per ship day were 7,528 in 2015 as compared to 8,032 in 2014.\nWe are a leading distributor and value-added processor of industrial metals with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation ( Ryerson Canada\u201d), and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation ( Ryerson Mexico\u201d). In addition to our North American operations, we conduct materials distribution operations in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited ( Ryerson China\u201d). Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson China and Ryerson Mexico, together with their subsidiaries (including Ryerson Inc. prior to its dissolution through merger), are collectively referred to herein as Ryerson,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or the Company.\u201d\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 lower administrative expenses, primarily due to lower outside technical services, of $3.0 million. \nCost of Materials Sold\nDuring the year 2016, a principal amount of $75.4 million of the 2018 Notes were repurchased for $67.9 million and retired, resulting in the recognition of an $7.4 million gain within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Including the $16.1 million loss on the redemption of the $569.9 million balance of the 2017 Notes and repurchase of $95.0 million of the 2018 Notes, the Company recognized a total net loss of $8.7 million within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during year 2016.\nAs a result of the factors above, in 2016 we reported an operating profit of $133.2 million, or 4.7% of sales, compared to an operating profit of $108.6 million, or 3.4% of sales, in 2015.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 17.9% in 2015 compared to 16.4% in 2014 due to, among other things, a decrease in cost of materials sold, as discussed above. Gross profit decreased 4.4% to $567.7 million in 2015 as compared to $593.8 million in 2014.\nPension Funding\nInventory valuation: Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market could be subject to certain estimates; however the measurement is primarily based on historical purchasing and sales information rather than forecasted metals pricing. Inventory costs reflect metal and in-bound freight purchase costs, third-party processing costs and internal direct and allocated indirect processing costs. Cost is primarily determined by the LIFO method. We regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow-moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends. Changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2016 consisted of the following amounts: $312.0 million borrowing under the Ryerson Credit Facility, $650.0 million under the 2022 Notes and $19.2 million of foreign debt, less 17.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. Availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility was $225 million and $185 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Discussion of our outstanding debt follows.\nThe following table presents contractual obligations at December 31, 2016:\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet Sales\nIn 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $2.2 million for employee costs related to expense reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. The charge consists primarily of severance costs for 140 employees in addition to $0.2 million of non-cash pensions and other post-retirement benefit costs. During 2015, the Company paid $0.8 million in costs related to this expense reduction initiative.\nThe Company made income tax payments of $1.8 million, $3.2 million and $1.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet cash used in investing activities was $20.7 million, $18.0 million and $34.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were $23.0 million, $22.3 million and $21.6 million, respectively. On August 3, 2015, the Company paid $7.7 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Southern Tool Steel, Inc. On December 31, 2014, the Company paid $20.1 million to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Fay Industries, Inc. and the membership interests of Fay Group, Ltd. In 2016 and 2015, the Company paid an additional $1.1 million in each year in deferred consideration owed to the sellers of Fay Industries, Inc. The Company sold property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale generating cash proceeds of $3.2 million, $10.4 million and $7.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nBelow is a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to total liquidity:\nThe calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. A one percentage point increase (decrease) in assumed health care trend rates would increase (decrease) our total service and interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2016 by $0.2 million and $(0.1) million, respectively. A decrease in the weighted average discount rate of 50 basis points would increase the postretirement benefit liability by approximately $3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2016, zero, zero and $650.0 million of the original outstanding principal amount of the 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes remain outstanding, respectively. The Company has repurchased and in the future may repurchase long-term notes in the open market.\nThe Ryerson Credit Facility contains events of default with respect to, among other things, default in the payment of principal when due or the payment of interest, fees and other amounts due thereunder after a specified grace period, material misrepresentations, failure to perform certain specified covenants, certain bankruptcy events, the invalidity of certain security agreements or guarantees, material judgments and the occurrence of a change of control of Ryerson. If such an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Ryerson Credit Facility will be entitled to various remedies, including acceleration of amounts outstanding under the Ryerson Credit Facility and all other actions permitted to be taken by secured creditors.\nNet sales decreased 9.7% to $2.9 billion in 2016 as compared to $3.2 billion in 2015. Average selling price decreased 10.0% reflecting weaker economic conditions in the metals market in 2016 compared to 2015. The average selling price per ton decreased in 2016 to $1,503 from $1,670 in 2015. Average selling prices per ton decreased for all of our product lines in 2016 with the largest decrease in our stainless steel plate, stainless steel flat and stainless steel long product lines. Tons sold increased 0.3% in 2016 with increases in shipments of stainless steel plate and stainless steel flat product lines offset by decreases in shipments of our carbon steel plate and carbon steel long product lines. Tons sold per ship day were 7,552 in 2016 as compared to 7,528 in 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nInterest and other expense on debt decreased to $96.3 million in 2015 from $107.4 million in 2014 primarily due to a lower principal amount outstanding of our 9.0% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d) and the 2018 Notes after the redemption of $99.5 million of the 2018 Notes in September of 2014 and the purchases of $30.1 million of the 2018 Notes as well as the purchases of $30.1 million of the 2017 Notes in 2015. Partially offsetting the reduction in debt was a $2.9 million charge in 2015 to write-off a portion of the issuance costs associated with the Company's old revolving credit facility agreement upon entering into a new revolving credit facility agreement. Other income and (expense), net was expense of $10.4 million in 2015 compared to expense of $5.9 million in 2014. The year 2015 net expense is primarily related to a $12.3 million charge due to an other-than-temporary impairment recognized on an available-for-sale investment, partially offset by foreign currency gains of $1.5 million. The year 2014 net expense was primarily related to a $11.2 million loss on the early redemption premium on the redemption of the $99.5 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes, partially offset by $5.3 million of foreign currency gains.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 15.3% in 2016 from 14.5% in 2015. Operating expenses in 2016 were $437.4 million, a decrease of $21.7 million from $459.1 million in 2015 primarily due to the following reasons:\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $3.7 million in 2015 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.7 million in 2014. The $3.7 million income tax expense in 2015 results predominantly from tax expense on earnings in the U.S. and the inability to benefit losses in our foreign subsidiaries due to valuation allowances. The $0.7 million income tax benefit in 2014 results from a tax benefit in the U.S. and the impact of certain initial public offering related transactions that are recognized differently for U.S. tax purposes, offset by tax expense in foreign subsidiaries.\nThe lenders under the Ryerson Credit Facility have the ability to reject a borrowing request if any event, circumstance or development has occurred that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company. If Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, any of the other borrowers or any restricted subsidiaries of JT Ryerson becomes insolvent or commences bankruptcy proceedings, all amounts borrowed under the Ryerson Credit Facility will become immediately due and payable.\n \u2022 impairment charges on assets of $7.7 million in 2015, primarily due to fixed asset impairments, and \nThe metals service center industry is generally considered cyclical with periods of strong demand and higher prices followed by periods of weaker demand and lower prices due to the cyclical nature of the industries in which the largest consumers of metals operate. However, domestic metals prices are volatile and remain difficult to predict. In 2016, the metals service center industry experienced weak demand and improved but volatile pricing conditions. U.S. shipment volumes as measured by the Metals Service Center Institute declined by 6.2 percent in 2016 compared to the prior year. Meanwhile, carbon prices recovered from historical lows at the end of 2015, peaking in June 2016, only to correct in October 2016, before starting an upward trajectory that continued through the end of the year. Additionally, 2016 nickel and aluminum prices each increased by double-digits compared to 2015 average prices.\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share was a loss of $0.02 in 2015 and a loss of $1.01 in 2014. The changes in earnings (loss) per share are due to the results of operations discussed above as well as an increase of 6.7 million in average shares outstanding in 2015 compared to 2014 after the issuance of 11.0 million shares of common stock in an initial public offering on August 8, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\nITEM 7.\nGross profit. Gross profit is the difference between net sales and the cost of materials sold. Our sales prices to our customers are subject to market competition. Achieving acceptable levels of gross profit is dependent on our acquiring metals at competitive prices, our ability to manage the impact of changing prices and efficiently managing our internal and external processing costs.\nDuring 2016, the Company paid $0.7 million in employee-related costs related to restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company also recorded a $0.3 million reduction to the reserve for employee-related costs and credited warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining $0.2 million of employee-related costs are expected to be paid in 2017.\nThe Company will continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets until such time as in management's judgment, considering all available positive and negative evidence, the Company determines that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable.\nrecorded a deferred tax liability for the effect of a possible repatriation of these assets as management intends to permanently reinvest these assets outside of the U.S. Specific plans for reinvestment include funding for future international acquisitions and funding of existing international operations.\nWe consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements, as application of these policies places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation of matters that are uncertain.\nPreparation of this Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are disclosed in Item 8 within Note 1: Summary of Accounting and Financial Policies. These policies have been consistently applied and address such matters as revenue recognition, depreciation methods, inventory valuation, asset impairment recognition and pension and postretirement expense. While policies associated with estimates and judgments may be affected by different assumptions or conditions, we believe our estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 14.5% in 2015 from 14.0% in 2014. Operating expenses in 2015 were $459.1 million, a decrease of $48.3 million from $507.4 million in 2014 primarily due to the following reasons:\nCost of materials sold decreased 14.2% to $2.6 billion in 2015 compared to $3.0 billion in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton in addition to the decrease in tons sold. The average cost of materials sold per ton decreased to $1,371 in 2015 from $1,497 in 2014. The average cost of materials sold for our stainless steel plate, carbon steel flat and carbon steel plate product lines decreased more than our other products, in line with the change in average selling price per ton.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's cash flows:\n (2) Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, we do not know the timing of when our obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits will occur, if at all. See Note 17 Income Taxes\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail. \nOn November 16, 2016, Ryerson entered into an amendment with respect to its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement (as amended, the Ryerson Credit Facility\u201d), to reduce the total facility size from $1.0 billion (the Old Credit Facility\u201d) to $750 million, reduce the interest rate on outstanding borrowings by 25 basis points, reduce commitment fees on amounts not borrowed by 2.5 basis points, and to extend the maturity date to November 16, 2021.\nLong-lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets: Long-lived assets held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment is recognized. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset's residual value, if any. Any related impairment loss is calculated based upon comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the asset. Separate intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. An impaired long-lived or intangible asset would be written down to fair value, based on various available valuation techniques, including the discounted cash flow method.\nOn a per ton basis, operating expenses decreased to $230 per ton in 2016 from $242 per ton in 2015.", "item_7_text": "Interest and other expense on debt decreased to $89.9 million in 2016 from $96.3 million in 2015 primarily due to a lower principal amount of debt outstanding in 2016, partially offset by an increase in the interest rate on a portion of our outstanding Notes after we redeemed the $569.9 million outstanding balance our 9.0% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d), redeemed the $170.4 million outstanding balance of our 11.25% Senior Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes\u201d) and issued $650.0 million of new 11.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) in 2016. The year 2015 also included a $2.9 million charge to write-off a portion of the issuance costs associated with the Company's old revolving credit facility agreement upon entering into a new revolving credit facility agreement. Other income and (expense), net was expense of $17.2 million in 2016 compared to expense of $10.4 million in 2015. The year 2016 net expense is primarily related to a $8.7 million net loss on debt redemptions, a $4.7 million charge due to an other-than-temporary impairment recognized on an available-for-sale investment and foreign currency losses of $3.9 million. The year 2015 net expense primarily related to a $12.3 million charge due to an other-than-temporary impairment recognized on an available-for-sale investment, partially offset by foreign currency gains of $1.5 million.\n (3) Interest payments related to the variable rate debt were estimated using the weighted average interest rate for the Ryerson Credit Facility. \nAt December 31, 2016, Ryerson had $312.0 million of outstanding borrowings, $16 million of letters of credit issued and $225 million available under the Ryerson Credit Facility compared to $272.2 million of outstanding borrowings, $17 million of letters of credit issued and $185 million available at December 31, 2015 under the Old Credit Facility. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and qualified cash pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as Ryerson is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these three amounts, less applicable reserves. Eligible accounts receivable, at any date of determination, is comprised of the aggregate value of all accounts directly created by a borrower (and in the case of Canadian accounts, a Canadian guarantor) in the ordinary course of business arising out of the sale of goods or the rendering of services, each of which has been invoiced, with such receivables adjusted to exclude various ineligible accounts, including, among other things, those to which a borrower (or guarantor, as applicable) does not have sole and absolute title and accounts arising out of a sale to an employee, officer, director, or affiliate of a borrower (or guarantor, as applicable). Eligible inventory, at any date of determination, is comprised of the aggregate value of all inventory owned by a borrower (and in the case of Canadian accounts, a Canadian guarantor), with such inventory adjusted to exclude various ineligible inventory, including, among other things, (i) any inventory that is classified as supplies\u201d or is unsaleable in the ordinary course of business, (ii) 50% of the value of any inventory that (A) has not been sold or processed within a 180 day period and (B) which is calculated to have more than 365 days of supply based upon the immediately preceding 6 months consumption, and (iii) 50% of the value of inventory classified as partial inventory pieces on the basis that the inventory has been cut below sales lengths customary for such inventory. Qualified cash consists of cash in an eligible deposit account that is subject to customary restrictions and liens in favor of the lenders. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility was 2.2 percent and 2.1 percent at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\noperations had sustained an operating profit in both the preceding cumulative three fiscal year period and in each of its two preceding fiscal years, providing objective evidence of the Company's ability to earn future profits. Combined with the Company's projections of future income providing additional subjective evidence of the Company's ability to earn future profits and management's judgment, the Company determined that these deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable and accordingly the valuation allowance was no longer required.\nWhen calculating pension expense for 2016, we assumed the pension plans' assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 7.10% for the U.S. plan, and between 5.50% and 5.75% for the Canadian plans. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans' assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. Our projected long-term rate of return for the U.S. pension plan is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans' assets, and is supported by the historical returns on our plans' assets. The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans' investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased 2016 pension expense by approximately $3 million.\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $7.2 million in 2016 compared to an income tax expense of $3.7 million in 2015. The $7.2 million income tax expense in 2016 results predominantly from tax expense on earnings in the U.S. and the inability to benefit losses in our foreign subsidiaries due to valuation allowances. The $3.7 million income tax expense in 2015 results predominantly from tax expense on earnings in the U.S. and the inability to benefit losses in our foreign subsidiaries due to valuation allowances.\nThe Company applied the provisions of ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d in accounting for the issuance of the 2022 Notes, redemption of the 2017 Notes and partial repurchase of the 2018 Notes. The evaluation of the accounting under ASC 470-50 was performed on a creditor by creditor basis in order to determine if the terms of the debt were substantially different and, as a result, whether to apply modification or extinguishment accounting. For the lenders where it was determined that the terms of the debt were not substantially different, modification accounting was applied. For the remaining lenders, extinguishment accounting was applied. In connection with this debt modification and extinguishment, the Company recorded a $16.1 million loss within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2016, primarily attributed to the costs incurred with third parties for arrangement fees, legal and other services related to the modified debt, as well as redemption fees paid to the creditors and unamortized debt issuance costs written off related to the extinguished debt. Additionally, the costs incurred with third parties for arrangement fees, legal and other services related to the extinguished debt and redemption fees paid to the creditors related to the modified debt were capitalized and are being amortized over the life of the modified debt using the effective interest method.\n \u2022 lower delivery expense of $6.9 million due to lower volume. \nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\nAs described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company assesses the need for a valuation allowance considering all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The fourth quarter of 2013 was the first quarter in which the Company's overall U.S.\nRestructuring\nOther Expenses\nOperating Profit\nOther Expenses\nThe assumptions used in the actuarial calculation of expenses and liabilities may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension or postretirement benefit expense we may record in the future.\nDuring 2015, LIFO income was $97 million related to the increase in carbon pricing, partially offset by decreases in pricing in stainless and aluminum. As a result of falling average selling prices, LIFO income in 2015 was partially offset by a $38 million charge\nThe Ryerson Credit Facility has an allocation of $660 million to the Company's subsidiaries in the United States and an allocation of $90 million to Ryerson Holding's Canadian subsidiary that is a borrower. Amounts outstanding under the Ryerson Credit Facility bear interest at (i) a rate determined by reference to (A) the base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America, N.A.'s prime rate and the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%) or (B) a LIBOR rate or, (ii) for Ryerson Holding's Canadian subsidiary that is a borrower, (A) a rate determined by reference to the Canadian base rate (the greatest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America-Canada Branch's base rate\u201d for commercial loans in U.S. Dollars made at its base rate\u201d and the 30 day LIBOR rate plus 1.00%), (B) the prime rate (the greater of Bank of America-Canada Branch's prime rate\u201d for commercial loans made by it in Canada in Canadian Dollars and the one-month Canadian bankers' acceptance rate plus 1.00%) or (C) the bankers' acceptance rate. The spread over the base rate and prime rate is between 0.25% and 0.50% and the spread over the LIBOR and for the bankers' acceptances is between 1.25% and 1.50%, depending on the amount available to be borrowed under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Overdue amounts and all amounts owed during the existence of a default bear interest at 2% above the rate otherwise applicable thereto. Ryerson also pays commitment fees on amounts not borrowed at a rate of 0.23%.\nFuture pension obligations for the U.S. plans were discounted using a rate of 4.14% at December 31, 2016. Future pension obligations for the Canadian plans were discounted using weighted average rates between 3.64% and 3.71% at December 31, 2016. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase the pension liability at December 31, 2016 by approximately $45 million.\n\nThe 2022 Notes and the related guarantees are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of JT Ryerson's and each guarantor's present and future assets located in the United States (other than receivables, inventory, money, deposit accounts and related general intangibles, certain other assets and proceeds thereof), subject to certain exceptions and customary permitted liens. The 2022 Notes and the related guarantees are also secured on a second-priority basis by a lien on the assets that secure JT Ryerson's and the Company's obligations under the Ryerson Credit Facility.\nDeferred Tax Amounts\nNoncontrolling Interest\nand interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken. For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a more likely than not\u201d threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Company's ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company's effective tax rate.\nNet Sales\nAvailability under the Ryerson China's credit facility was $26 million and $23 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Letters of credit issued by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $1 million and $2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nCapital Expenditures\n\nOn May 24, 2016, JT Ryerson issued $650 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes (the 2022 Notes\u201d). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 11.00% per annum. The 2022 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries that are co-borrowers or that have guarantee obligations under the Ryerson Credit Facility.\nIn 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $1.0 million related to a facility closure, which consists of tenancy-related costs, primarily future lease payments. The Company paid $0.2 million in costs related to this facility closure and also reclassified an existing $0.2 million liability for future lease payments at this facility to the restructuring reserve. The Company also paid $0.3 million in costs related to a facility closed in 2013 and recorded an addition of $0.1 million to the reserve for tenancy-related costs, which was charged to warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining $1.3 million of tenancy-related costs are expected to be paid through 2025.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Ryerson Credit Facility also contains covenants that, among other things, restrict Ryerson Holding and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to the incurrence of debt, the creation of liens, transactions with affiliates, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions. The Ryerson Credit Facility also requires that, if availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility declines to a certain level, Ryerson maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and includes defaults upon (among other things) the occurrence of a change of control of Ryerson and a cross-default to other financing arrangements.\n (4) The purchase obligations with suppliers are entered into when we receive firm sales commitments with certain of our customers. \nDuring 2016, LIFO expense was $7 million related to increases in pricing for carbon products. During 2015, LIFO income was $97 million related to decreases in pricing for all product lines. As a result of falling average selling prices, LIFO income in 2015 was partially offset by a $38 million charge to record inventory at the lower of cost or market. In 2016, we recorded income of $14 million to adjust the lower of cost or market inventory reserve.\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 a restructuring charge of $2.5 million in 2015. \nOverview\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of our metals products. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of product to customers. The timing of shipment is substantially the same as the timing of delivery to customers given the proximity of our distribution sites to our customers.\nBasic earnings (loss) per share was earnings of $0.55 in 2016 and a loss of $0.02 in 2015. Diluted earnings (loss) per share was earnings of $0.54 in 2016 and a loss of $0.02 in 2015. The changes in earnings (loss) per share are due to the results of operations discussed above as well as an increase of 2.2 million in average shares outstanding in 2016 compared to 2015 after the issuance of 5 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering in July 2016.\nWe record operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and the estimated effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We follow detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction when reviewing tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide for valuation allowances as required. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on historical taxable income, the expected reversals of existing temporary differences, tax planning strategies and on forecasts of future taxable income. The forecasts of future taxable income require assumptions regarding volume, selling prices, margins, expense levels and industry cyclicality. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets related to those jurisdictions.\nThe Company made contributions of $22.1 million in 2016, $42.5 million in 2015 and $55.4 million in 2014 to improve the Company's pension plans funded status. At December 31, 2016, as reflected in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, pension liabilities exceeded plan assets by $216 million. The Company anticipates that it will have a minimum required pension contribution of approximately $22 million in 2017 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA\u201d), Pension Protection Act in the U.S and the Ontario Pension Benefits Act in Canada. Future contribution requirements depend on the investment returns on plan assets, the impact of discount rates on pension liabilities, and changes in regulatory requirements. The Company is unable to determine the amount or timing of any such contributions required by ERISA or whether any such contributions would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or cash flows. The Company believes that cash flow from operations and the Ryerson Credit Facility described above will provide sufficient funds to make the minimum required contribution in 2017.\nPension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions: We sponsor various benefit plans covering a portion of our employees for pension and postretirement medical costs. Statistical methods are used to anticipate future events when calculating expenses and liabilities related to the plans. The statistical methods include assumptions about, among other things, the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of increase of health care costs and the rate of future compensation increases. Our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates when estimating expenses and liabilities. The discount rate used for U.S. plans reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on our annual measurement date (December 31) and is subject to change each year. The discount rate was determined by matching, on an approximate basis, the coupons and maturities for a\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company's deferred tax assets include $76 million related to U.S. federal net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards, $12 million related to state NOL carryforwards and $8 million related to foreign NOL carryforwards, available at December 31, 2016.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 20.0% in 2016 compared to 17.9% in 2015 due to, among other things, a decrease in cost of materials sold, as discussed above. Gross profit increased 0.5% to $570.6 million in 2016 as compared to $567.7 million in 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe 2022 Notes contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, our ability, and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock, make investments, sell assets, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations or create liens or use assets as security in other transactions. Subject to certain exceptions, JT Ryerson may only pay dividends to Ryerson Holding to the extent of 50% of future net income, once prior losses are offset.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 with the year ended December 31, 2015\nProvision for allowances, claims and doubtful accounts: We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers and set credit limits based upon review of the customers' current credit information and payment history. We monitor customer payments and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Estimation of such losses requires adjusting historical loss experience for current economic conditions and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers. We cannot guarantee that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience. Provisions for allowances and claims are based upon historical rates, expected trends and estimates of potential returns, allowances, customer discounts and incentives. We consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of the provision for allowances, claims and doubtful accounts.\nIn 2015, the Company also recorded a $0.3 million charge to increase the reserve for tenancy-related costs for a facility closed in 2013. During 2015, the Company paid $0.4 million in tenancy costs related to this facility.\nLegal contingencies: We are involved in a number of legal and regulatory matters including those discussed in Note 12 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our legal matters based on available information to assess potential liability. We consult with outside counsel involved in our legal matters when analyzing potential outcomes. We cannot determine at this time whether any potential liability related to this litigation would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company anticipates capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, to be approximately $25 million in 2017. The spending includes maintenance expenditures and improvements to maintain, upgrade, and add to the Company's North American processing capabilities.\nIncome Tax Payments\nIncome Taxes: Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserve for uncertain tax positions reflect our best estimate of taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. The determination of the consolidated income tax expense requires judgment and estimation by management. It is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates that management has used to determine its consolidated income tax expense.\n \u2022 a $25.0 million charge in 2014 to terminate the advisory service agreement with Platinum Advisors in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on August 13, 2014, which is described in Note 12, Related Parties\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, \nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Notes, along with borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, was used to (i) repurchase and/or redeem in full the $569.9 million balance of JT Ryerson's 9.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d), plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the repayment date, (ii) repurchase $95.0 million of JT Ryerson's 11.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes\u201d), and (iii) pay related fees, expenses and premiums.\nAt December 31, 2016, Ryerson China's total foreign borrowings were $19.2 million, which were owed to banks in Asia at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4% per annum and secured by inventory and property, plant and equipment. At December 31, 2015, Ryerson China's total foreign borrowings were $21.8 million, which were owed to banks in Asia at a weighted average interest rate of 4.3% per annum and secured by inventory and property, plant and equipment. Other foreign borrowings were zero and $0.2 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to the issuance of the 2022 Notes with a principle amount of $650.0 million, net proceeds of $71.5 million from the issuance of common stock, and net proceeds of $37.0 million from credit facility borrowings, partially offset by the redemption of the $569.9 million outstanding balance of the 2017 Notes and $170.4 million of the 2018 Notes. Net cash used in financing activities was $232.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily related to the purchases of $30.1 million principal amount of the 2017 Notes repurchased for $29.4 million and the purchases of $30.1 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes repurchased for $30.5 million, and $164.4 million of repayments of credit facility borrowings with cash provided by operations discussed above. Net cash used in financing activities was $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, we received $112.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock in an initial public offering and used $110.7 million of the proceeds to redeem $99.5 million principal amount of our 2018 Notes and pay a $11.2 million redemption premium. In addition, credit facility borrowings in 2014 increased $63.8 million primarily to fund cash used in operating activities as well as capital expenditures and book overdrafts increased $36.0 million.\nAs a result of the factors above, in 2015 we reported an operating profit of $108.6 million, or 3.4% of sales, compared to an operating profit of $86.4 million, or 2.4% of sales, in 2014.\nRyerson Credit Facility\n</table>\nCost of materials sold. Cost of materials sold includes metal purchase and in-bound freight costs, third-party processing costs and direct and indirect internal processing costs. The cost of materials sold fluctuates with our sales volume and our ability to purchase metals at competitive prices. Increases in sales volume generally enable us both to improve purchasing leverage with suppliers, as we buy larger quantities of metals inventories, and to reduce operating expenses per ton sold.\nRyerson China's and A\u00e7ofran's results of operations was a loss in 2015 and 2014. The portion of the loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Ryerson China and A\u00e7ofran was $1.3 million for 2015 and $0.5 million for 2014.\nThese changes were partially offset by:\nNet Sales. Our sales volume and pricing is driven by market demand, which is largely determined by overall industrial production and conditions in specific industries in which our customers operate. Sales prices are also primarily driven by market factors such as overall demand and availability of product. Our net sales include revenue from product sales, net of returns, allowances, customer discounts and incentives.\nretired, resulting in the recognition of a $0.4 million loss within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRyerson Holding Corporation ( Ryerson Holding\u201d), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. ( JT Ryerson\u201d), a Delaware corporation. On December 17, 2014, Ryerson Inc., formerly a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, merged with and into JT Ryerson, which was previously an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, with JT Ryerson as the surviving corporation. As a result of such merger, from and after December 17, 2014, JT Ryerson has been a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC ( Platinum\u201d) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding common stock.\nBusiness\nGoodwill: We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of recorded goodwill annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever indicators of potential impairment exist. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to developments in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method, as necessary. Factors that may be considered indicators of impairment include: deterioration in general economic conditions; declines in the market conditions of our products, including metals prices; a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; reduced future cash flow estimates; and slower growth rates in our industry, among others. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value based on our qualitative assessment, we will proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. In step one, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair value of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. An income approach based on discounted future cash flows requires us to estimate income from operations based on projected results and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. A market approach estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures of comparable public companies. If these estimates or their related assumptions for commodity prices and demand change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 lower salaries and wages of $6.3 million due to lower employee headcount, \nCost of materials sold decreased 11.9% to $2.3 billion in 2016 compared to $2.6 billion in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton. The average cost of materials sold per ton decreased to $1,203 in 2016 from $1,371 in 2015. The average cost of materials sold for our stainless steel plate, stainless steel flat and carbon steel plate product lines decreased more than our other products, in line with the change in average selling price per ton.\n (1) The contractual obligations disclosed above do not include our potential future pension funding obligations (see previous discussion under Pension Funding\u201d caption). \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $25.4 million and $259.1 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $73.3 million during 2014. Net income (loss) was income of $18.9 million in 2016 and a loss of $1.8 million and $26.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities of $25.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $42.5 million, an increase in accounts payable of $20.5 million and net income of $18.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $22.5 million, pension contributions of $22.1 million and premium and fees related to debt modification of $15.7 million. Cash provided by operating activities of $259.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in inventory of $178.1 million as we reduced inventory as metal prices weakened during the year. In addition, accounts receivable declined $88.0 million reflecting lower average selling prices and tons sold in 2015, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense was $43.7 million and we recorded a non-cash charge of $12.3 million due to an other-than-temporary impairment charge recognized on an available-for-sale investment. Partially offsetting the cash inflows were pension contributions of $42.5 million and lower accrued liabilities of $20.0 million primarily due to a lower accrual for incentive compensation in 2015. Cash used in operating activities of $73.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of pension contributions of $55.4 million, the net loss in 2014 of $26.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $22.4 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $19.5 million reflecting higher sales in 2014, partially offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $45.6 million.\nThe 2022 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2019 at certain redemption prices. The redemption price for the 2022 Notes if redeemed during the twelve months beginning (i) May 15, 2019 is 105.50%, (ii) May 15, 2020 is 102.75%, and (iii) May 15, 2021 and thereafter is 100.00%. JT Ryerson may redeem some or all of the 2022 Notes before May 15, 2019 at a redemption price of 100.00% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a make-whole\u201d premium. In addition, JT Ryerson may redeem up to 35% of the 2022 Notes before May 15, 2019 with respect to the 2022 Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a price equal to 111.00%, with respect to the 2022 Notes, of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any. JT Ryerson may be required to make an offer to purchase the 2022 Notes upon the sale of assets or upon a change of control.\nSales, cost of materials sold, gross profit and operating expense control are the principal factors that impact our profitability:\n \u2022 Lower employee benefit costs of $11.0 million resulting mainly from a reduction in the net periodic benefit cost for pensions, \nDuring the year 2015, a principal amount of $30.1 million of the 2017 Notes were repurchased for $29.4 million and retired, resulting in the recognition of a $0.7 million gain within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the year 2015, a principal amount of $30.1 million of the 2018 Notes were repurchased for $30.5 million and\nThe following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data:\nIndustry and Operating Trends\nPurchase Price Accounting: Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the Company to record assets and liabilities of the business acquired at their estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The Company uses valuation specialists, where necessary, to perform appraisals and assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require management to make estimates and assumptions that are critical in determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\nOperating expenses. Optimizing business processes and asset utilization to lower fixed expenses such as employee, facility and truck fleet costs which cannot be rapidly reduced in times of declining volume, and maintaining low fixed cost structure in times of increasing sales volume, have a significant impact on our profitability. Operating expenses include costs related to warehousing and distributing our products as well as selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of $21 million comprised primarily of a deferred tax asset of $85 million related to pension liabilities, a deferred tax asset related to postretirement benefits other than pensions of $28 million, $30 million of Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) credit carryforwards and deferred tax assets of $96 million related to federal, local and foreign tax loss carryforwards, offset by a valuation allowance of $20 million and deferred tax liabilities of $81 million related to fixed assets and $129 million related to inventory.\nportfolio of corporate bonds (rated Aa or better by Moody's Investor Services or AA or better by Standard and Poor's) to the expected plan benefit payments defined by the projected benefit obligation. The discount rates used for plans outside the U.S. are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities, the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment.\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 of $80.7 million, compared to $63.2 million at December 31, 2015 and $60.0 million at December 31, 2014. The Company had $964 million, $1,024 million and $1,242 million of total debt outstanding, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 105%, 116% and 111% and $225 million, $185 million and $245 million available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company had total liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility, the Old Credit Facility, and foreign debt facilities) of $301 million, $273 million and $328 million at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total liquidity is not a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) financial measure. We believe that total liquidity provides additional information for measuring our ability to fund our operations. Total liquidity does not represent, and should not be used as a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and total liquidity is not necessarily an indication of whether cash flow will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements.\nTotal Debt\nBased on the impairment test performed in the prior year on October 1, 2015, the reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 25%. Based on a qualitative assessment performed on October 1, 2016, the Company concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. Therefore, we did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test during 2016. The discount rate for the reporting unit was estimated to be 14.0% at October 1, 2016. The Company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable risk-adjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit. Deterioration in market conditions in our industry or products, changes in expected future cash flows, expected growth rates or to discount rates could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n \u2022 transaction-related compensation expense of $7.7 million associated with the initial public offering in 2014, \n2017, 2018 and 2022 Notes\nGross Profit\nThese changes were partially offset by:\n \u2022 an impairment charge on assets of $7.7 million in 2015, primarily due to fixed asset impairments, \nOperating Profit\n \u2022 higher incentive compensation expense of $14.8 million. \nCost of Materials Sold\n \u2022 lower facility expenses, primarily taxes and repair and maintenance costs, of $6.2 million, and \nRecent accounting pronouncements are discussed within Note 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 with the year ended December 31, 2014\nSimilar to other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. At the request of our customers, we have entered into swaps in order to mitigate our customers' risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors' responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers.\nOn a per ton basis, operating expenses decreased to $242 per ton in 2015 from $250 per ton in 2014.\nOf the total cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016, $71 million was held in subsidiaries outside the United States which is deemed to be permanently reinvested. Ryerson does not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds from its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Although the Company has historically satisfied needs for more capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances, it could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions which could result in higher effective tax rates. The Company has not\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under the $750 million revolving credit facility (the Ryerson Credit Facility\u201d) that matures on November 16, 2021. Its principal source of operating cash is from the sale of metals and other materials. Its principal uses of cash are for payments associated with the procurement and processing of metals and other materials inventories, costs incurred for the warehousing and delivery of inventories and the selling and administrative costs of the business, capital expenditures, and for interest payments on debt.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2016 decreased $60.0 million to $963.5 million from $1,023.5 million at December 31, 2015 as a result of the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the net cash provided by operating activities.\nBorrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility are secured by first-priority liens on all of the inventory, accounts receivables, lockbox accounts and related assets of the borrowers and the guarantors.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Ryerson Holding Corporation and Subsidiaries and the Notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the section entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nIn 2014, the Company paid $0.7 million in tenancy costs related to a facility closed in 2013. In 2014, the Company also recorded a $0.1 million reduction to the reserve for tenancy-related costs and credited warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2014, the Company also paid the remaining $0.1 million of employee costs related to the closure of this facility.\nWe purchase large quantities of metal products from primary producers and sell these materials in smaller quantities to a wide variety of metals-consuming industries. More than 75% of the metals products sold are processed by us by burning, sawing, slitting, blanking, cutting to length or other techniques. We sell our products and services to many industries, including commercial ground transportation manufacturing, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable production, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing and oil & gas. In 2016, food processing and agricultural equipment, consumer durable and construction industries grew volumes compared to 2015, offset by declines in oil & gas, HVAC and ground transportation industries. The other two general industrial sectors of our business, metal fabricators and industrial machinery and equipment, showed a slight net gain in volume.\n \u2022 lower incentive compensation expense of $16.1 million, and \nto record inventory at the lower of cost or market. During 2014, LIFO expense was $42 million related to increases in pricing for all product lines. In 2015, we also recorded a credit to cost of materials sold of $4 million related to the settlement of litigation regarding the price of materials that we were charged.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d the Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The Company records a valuation allowance when, based upon the evaluation of all available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we analyze, among other things, our recent history of earnings, the nature and timing of reversing book-tax temporary differences, tax planning strategies and future income. After considering both the positive and negative evidence available, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company determined that it was more-likely-than-not that it would not realize a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company established a valuation allowance against a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company released a portion of the valuation allowance related to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, JT Ryerson, during 2012. The Company released most of the remaining U.S. related valuation allowance during 2013. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a valuation allowance of $22.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a valuation allowance of $20.0 million, a decrease of $2.6 million from the prior year mainly related to changes in foreign deferred tax assets.\nThe Company's income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax\nCapital expenditures during 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $23.0 million, $22.3 million and $21.6 million, respectively. Capital expenditures were primarily for machinery and equipment.\nIn 2016, Ryerson China's results of operations was income partially offset by a loss at our Brazil operations through A\u00e7ofran A\u00e7os e Metais Ltda ( A\u00e7ofran\u201d) in which we had a 50% direct ownership percentage, until we substantially liquidated our investment in Acofran during 2016. The portion of Ryerson China and A\u00e7ofran's results attributable to the noncontrolling interest in 2016 was income of $0.2 million. In 2015, Ryerson China's and A\u00e7ofran's results of operations was a loss. The portion of the income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Ryerson China and A\u00e7ofran was a loss of $1.3 million for 2015.\n\nGross Profit\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit, which totaled $17 million as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, other than normal course long-term operating leases included in the following Contractual Obligations table, we do not have any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements. None of these off-balance sheet arrangements are likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nProceeds from borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility and repayments of borrowings thereunder that are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows represent borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement with original maturities greater than three months. Net proceeds (repayments) under the Ryerson Credit Facility represent borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility with original maturities less than three months.\nForeign Debt\nNet sales decreased 12.6% to $3.2 billion in 2015 as compared to $3.6 billion in 2014. Average selling price decreased 6.7% while tons sold decreased 6.3% reflecting weaker economic conditions in the metals market in 2015 compared to 2014. The average selling price per ton decreased in 2015 to $1,670 from $1,790 in 2014. Average selling prices per ton decreased for all of our product lines in 2015 with the largest decrease in our stainless steel plate, carbon steel flat and stainless steel flat product lines. Tons sold in 2015 decreased for most of our product lines, with the largest decrease in our carbon steel long, stainless steel long and carbon plate product lines, partially offset by increased tons sold for our aluminum plate product line. Tons sold per ship day were 7,528 in 2015 as compared to 8,032 in 2014.\nWe are a leading distributor and value-added processor of industrial metals with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation ( Ryerson Canada\u201d), and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation ( Ryerson Mexico\u201d). In addition to our North American operations, we conduct materials distribution operations in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited ( Ryerson China\u201d). Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson China and Ryerson Mexico, together with their subsidiaries (including Ryerson Inc. prior to its dissolution through merger), are collectively referred to herein as Ryerson,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or the Company.\u201d\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 lower administrative expenses, primarily due to lower outside technical services, of $3.0 million. \nCost of Materials Sold\nDuring the year 2016, a principal amount of $75.4 million of the 2018 Notes were repurchased for $67.9 million and retired, resulting in the recognition of an $7.4 million gain within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Including the $16.1 million loss on the redemption of the $569.9 million balance of the 2017 Notes and repurchase of $95.0 million of the 2018 Notes, the Company recognized a total net loss of $8.7 million within other income and (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during year 2016.\nAs a result of the factors above, in 2016 we reported an operating profit of $133.2 million, or 4.7% of sales, compared to an operating profit of $108.6 million, or 3.4% of sales, in 2015.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 17.9% in 2015 compared to 16.4% in 2014 due to, among other things, a decrease in cost of materials sold, as discussed above. Gross profit decreased 4.4% to $567.7 million in 2015 as compared to $593.8 million in 2014.\nPension Funding\nInventory valuation: Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market could be subject to certain estimates; however the measurement is primarily based on historical purchasing and sales information rather than forecasted metals pricing. Inventory costs reflect metal and in-bound freight purchase costs, third-party processing costs and internal direct and allocated indirect processing costs. Cost is primarily determined by the LIFO method. We regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow-moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends. Changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2016 consisted of the following amounts: $312.0 million borrowing under the Ryerson Credit Facility, $650.0 million under the 2022 Notes and $19.2 million of foreign debt, less 17.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. Availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility was $225 million and $185 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Discussion of our outstanding debt follows.\nThe following table presents contractual obligations at December 31, 2016:\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet Sales\nIn 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $2.2 million for employee costs related to expense reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. The charge consists primarily of severance costs for 140 employees in addition to $0.2 million of non-cash pensions and other post-retirement benefit costs. During 2015, the Company paid $0.8 million in costs related to this expense reduction initiative.\nThe Company made income tax payments of $1.8 million, $3.2 million and $1.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet cash used in investing activities was $20.7 million, $18.0 million and $34.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were $23.0 million, $22.3 million and $21.6 million, respectively. On August 3, 2015, the Company paid $7.7 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Southern Tool Steel, Inc. On December 31, 2014, the Company paid $20.1 million to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Fay Industries, Inc. and the membership interests of Fay Group, Ltd. In 2016 and 2015, the Company paid an additional $1.1 million in each year in deferred consideration owed to the sellers of Fay Industries, Inc. The Company sold property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale generating cash proceeds of $3.2 million, $10.4 million and $7.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nBelow is a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to total liquidity:\nThe calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. A one percentage point increase (decrease) in assumed health care trend rates would increase (decrease) our total service and interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2016 by $0.2 million and $(0.1) million, respectively. A decrease in the weighted average discount rate of 50 basis points would increase the postretirement benefit liability by approximately $3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2016, zero, zero and $650.0 million of the original outstanding principal amount of the 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes remain outstanding, respectively. The Company has repurchased and in the future may repurchase long-term notes in the open market.\nThe Ryerson Credit Facility contains events of default with respect to, among other things, default in the payment of principal when due or the payment of interest, fees and other amounts due thereunder after a specified grace period, material misrepresentations, failure to perform certain specified covenants, certain bankruptcy events, the invalidity of certain security agreements or guarantees, material judgments and the occurrence of a change of control of Ryerson. If such an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Ryerson Credit Facility will be entitled to various remedies, including acceleration of amounts outstanding under the Ryerson Credit Facility and all other actions permitted to be taken by secured creditors.\nNet sales decreased 9.7% to $2.9 billion in 2016 as compared to $3.2 billion in 2015. Average selling price decreased 10.0% reflecting weaker economic conditions in the metals market in 2016 compared to 2015. The average selling price per ton decreased in 2016 to $1,503 from $1,670 in 2015. Average selling prices per ton decreased for all of our product lines in 2016 with the largest decrease in our stainless steel plate, stainless steel flat and stainless steel long product lines. Tons sold increased 0.3% in 2016 with increases in shipments of stainless steel plate and stainless steel flat product lines offset by decreases in shipments of our carbon steel plate and carbon steel long product lines. Tons sold per ship day were 7,552 in 2016 as compared to 7,528 in 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nInterest and other expense on debt decreased to $96.3 million in 2015 from $107.4 million in 2014 primarily due to a lower principal amount outstanding of our 9.0% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d) and the 2018 Notes after the redemption of $99.5 million of the 2018 Notes in September of 2014 and the purchases of $30.1 million of the 2018 Notes as well as the purchases of $30.1 million of the 2017 Notes in 2015. Partially offsetting the reduction in debt was a $2.9 million charge in 2015 to write-off a portion of the issuance costs associated with the Company's old revolving credit facility agreement upon entering into a new revolving credit facility agreement. Other income and (expense), net was expense of $10.4 million in 2015 compared to expense of $5.9 million in 2014. The year 2015 net expense is primarily related to a $12.3 million charge due to an other-than-temporary impairment recognized on an available-for-sale investment, partially offset by foreign currency gains of $1.5 million. The year 2014 net expense was primarily related to a $11.2 million loss on the early redemption premium on the redemption of the $99.5 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes, partially offset by $5.3 million of foreign currency gains.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 15.3% in 2016 from 14.5% in 2015. Operating expenses in 2016 were $437.4 million, a decrease of $21.7 million from $459.1 million in 2015 primarily due to the following reasons:\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $3.7 million in 2015 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.7 million in 2014. The $3.7 million income tax expense in 2015 results predominantly from tax expense on earnings in the U.S. and the inability to benefit losses in our foreign subsidiaries due to valuation allowances. The $0.7 million income tax benefit in 2014 results from a tax benefit in the U.S. and the impact of certain initial public offering related transactions that are recognized differently for U.S. tax purposes, offset by tax expense in foreign subsidiaries.\nThe lenders under the Ryerson Credit Facility have the ability to reject a borrowing request if any event, circumstance or development has occurred that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company. If Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, any of the other borrowers or any restricted subsidiaries of JT Ryerson becomes insolvent or commences bankruptcy proceedings, all amounts borrowed under the Ryerson Credit Facility will become immediately due and payable.\n \u2022 impairment charges on assets of $7.7 million in 2015, primarily due to fixed asset impairments, and \nThe metals service center industry is generally considered cyclical with periods of strong demand and higher prices followed by periods of weaker demand and lower prices due to the cyclical nature of the industries in which the largest consumers of metals operate. However, domestic metals prices are volatile and remain difficult to predict. In 2016, the metals service center industry experienced weak demand and improved but volatile pricing conditions. U.S. shipment volumes as measured by the Metals Service Center Institute declined by 6.2 percent in 2016 compared to the prior year. Meanwhile, carbon prices recovered from historical lows at the end of 2015, peaking in June 2016, only to correct in October 2016, before starting an upward trajectory that continued through the end of the year. Additionally, 2016 nickel and aluminum prices each increased by double-digits compared to 2015 average prices.\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share was a loss of $0.02 in 2015 and a loss of $1.01 in 2014. The changes in earnings (loss) per share are due to the results of operations discussed above as well as an increase of 6.7 million in average shares outstanding in 2015 compared to 2014 after the issuance of 11.0 million shares of common stock in an initial public offering on August 8, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\nITEM 7.\nGross profit. Gross profit is the difference between net sales and the cost of materials sold. Our sales prices to our customers are subject to market competition. Achieving acceptable levels of gross profit is dependent on our acquiring metals at competitive prices, our ability to manage the impact of changing prices and efficiently managing our internal and external processing costs.\nDuring 2016, the Company paid $0.7 million in employee-related costs related to restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company also recorded a $0.3 million reduction to the reserve for employee-related costs and credited warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining $0.2 million of employee-related costs are expected to be paid in 2017.\nThe Company will continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets until such time as in management's judgment, considering all available positive and negative evidence, the Company determines that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable.\nrecorded a deferred tax liability for the effect of a possible repatriation of these assets as management intends to permanently reinvest these assets outside of the U.S. Specific plans for reinvestment include funding for future international acquisitions and funding of existing international operations.\nWe consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements, as application of these policies places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation of matters that are uncertain.\nPreparation of this Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are disclosed in Item 8 within Note 1: Summary of Accounting and Financial Policies. These policies have been consistently applied and address such matters as revenue recognition, depreciation methods, inventory valuation, asset impairment recognition and pension and postretirement expense. While policies associated with estimates and judgments may be affected by different assumptions or conditions, we believe our estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 14.5% in 2015 from 14.0% in 2014. Operating expenses in 2015 were $459.1 million, a decrease of $48.3 million from $507.4 million in 2014 primarily due to the following reasons:\nCost of materials sold decreased 14.2% to $2.6 billion in 2015 compared to $3.0 billion in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton in addition to the decrease in tons sold. The average cost of materials sold per ton decreased to $1,371 in 2015 from $1,497 in 2014. The average cost of materials sold for our stainless steel plate, carbon steel flat and carbon steel plate product lines decreased more than our other products, in line with the change in average selling price per ton.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's cash flows:\n (2) Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, we do not know the timing of when our obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits will occur, if at all. See Note 17 Income Taxes\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail. \nOn November 16, 2016, Ryerson entered into an amendment with respect to its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement (as amended, the Ryerson Credit Facility\u201d), to reduce the total facility size from $1.0 billion (the Old Credit Facility\u201d) to $750 million, reduce the interest rate on outstanding borrowings by 25 basis points, reduce commitment fees on amounts not borrowed by 2.5 basis points, and to extend the maturity date to November 16, 2021.\nLong-lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets: Long-lived assets held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment is recognized. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset's residual value, if any. Any related impairment loss is calculated based upon comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the asset. Separate intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. An impaired long-lived or intangible asset would be written down to fair value, based on various available valuation techniques, including the discounted cash flow method.\nOn a per ton basis, operating expenses decreased to $230 per ton in 2016 from $242 per ton in 2015.", "item_7_tables": "Table 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td>
